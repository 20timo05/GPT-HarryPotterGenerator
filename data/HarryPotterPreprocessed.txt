CHAPTER ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.
Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy
was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want
Dudley mixing with a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the
country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a
screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,
because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the
walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got
into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley
didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to
look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet
Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking
of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and
stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the
corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now
reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of
nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help
noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in
funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this
was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering
wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite
close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man
had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some
silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...
yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.
Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate
on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad
daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed
open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never
seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made
several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a
very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs
and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't
know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering
excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on
his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he
caught a few words of what they were saying.
"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry"
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better
of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost
finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the
receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was
being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were
lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think
of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even
seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point
in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her
sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all
the same, those people in cloaks...
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that
he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It
was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a
violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the
ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in
a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir,
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone
at
last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,
happy day!"
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that
was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping
he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he
didn't approve of imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --
and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that
morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a
stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying
to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all
about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had
learned a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When
Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to
catch the last report on the evening news:
"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's
owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally
hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been
hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since
sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly
changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin.
"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather.
Going
to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"
"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not
only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as
Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead
of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting
stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's
not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight."
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?
Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?
And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was
no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat
nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister
lately, have you?"
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,
they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.
"No," she said sharply. "Why?"
"Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls... shooting
stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."
"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley.
"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you
know... her crowd."
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered
whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter." He decided he
didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son --
he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"
"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"
"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me."
"Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite
agree."
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.
While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the
bedroom
window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for
something.
Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the
Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of
-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.
Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting
thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were
involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.
Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about
them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get
mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over
-- it couldn't affect them....
How very wrong he was.
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat
on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as
still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of
Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the
next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the
ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which
were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,
a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.
His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon
spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He
was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to
realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,
which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For
some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and
muttered, "I should have known."
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a
silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and
clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He
clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times
he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street
were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beadyeyed
Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his
cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down
on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he
spoke to it.
"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling
at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly
the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was
wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight
bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.
"How did you know it was me?" she asked.
"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."
"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said
Professor McGonagall.
"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a
dozen feasts and parties on my way here."
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently.
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles
have noticed something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked her
head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks
of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They
were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."
"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious
little to celebrate for eleven years."
"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no
reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on
the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,
swapping rumors."
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping
he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "A
fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have
disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he
really has gone, Dumbledore?"
"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful
for. Would you care for a lemon drop?"
"A what?"
"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of"
"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't
think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if
You-Know-Who has gone -"
"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him
by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I
have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:
Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was
unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. "It all gets so
confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any
reason
to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.
"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're
the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."
"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will
never have."
"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."
"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey
told me she liked my new earmuffs."
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The
owls
are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what
everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally
stopped him?"
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most
anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard
wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed
Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that
whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing
another lemon drop and did not answer.
"What they're saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort
turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is
that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. "
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.
"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it...
Oh, Albus..."
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I
know..." he said heavily.
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. "That's not all.
They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he
couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,
but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's
power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
"It's -- it's true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he's
done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?
It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the
name of heaven did Harry survive?"
"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know."
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a
golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.
It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because
he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose it was
he who told you I'd be here, by the way?"
"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don't suppose you're going to
tell me why you're here, of all places?"
"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family
he has left now."
"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?" cried
Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.
"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't
find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw
him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.
Harry Potter come and live here!"
"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and
uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've
written them a letter."
"A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on
the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a
letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a
legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day
in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child
in our world will know his name!"
"Exactly," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his
half-moon glasses. "It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous
before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even
remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away
from all that until he's ready to take it?"
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed,
and
then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy
getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she
thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
"Hagrid's bringing him."
"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as
this?"
I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore.
"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said Professor
McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does
tend to -- what was that?"
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and
a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of
them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride
it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times
as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands
the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were
like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.
"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. And where did
you get that motorcycle?"
"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it to
me. I've got him, sir."
"No problems, were there?"
"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right
before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was
flyin' over Bristol."
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a
tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously
shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
"Is that where -?" whispered Professor McGonagall.
"Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar forever."
"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"
"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself
above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well
-- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with."
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys'
house.
"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent his
great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a
wounded dog.
"Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you'll wake the Muggles!"
"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and
burying his face in it. "But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead
-- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -"
"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or
we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly
on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to
the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out
of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to
the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall
blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from
Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.
"Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that's that. We've no business staying
here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."
"Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his
bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose
into the air and off into the night.
"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore,
nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he
stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and
twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet
Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking
around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the
bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
"Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish
of his cloak, he was gone.
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and
tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect
astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his
blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside
him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was
famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.
Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk
bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and
pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up
their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy
who lived!"
CHAPTER TWO
THE VANISHING GLASS
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find
their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at
all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass
number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living
room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when
Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.
Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a
large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley
Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large
blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a
computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.
The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for
long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made
the first noise of the day.
"Up! Get up! Now!"
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.
"Up!" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then
the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his
back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a
good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny
feeling he'd had the same dream before.
His aunt was back outside the door.
"Are you up yet?" she demanded.
"Nearly," said Harry.
"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you
dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday."
Harry groaned.
"What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door.
"Nothing, nothing..."
Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out
of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and,
after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to
spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and
that was where he slept.
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as
though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the
second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a
racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated
exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's
favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry
didn't look it, but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes
of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry
had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He
wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of
all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry
liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that
was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could
remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt
Petunia was how he had gotten it.
"In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask
questions."
Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the
Dursleys.
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.
"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper
and
shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts
than the rest of the boys in his class put
together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --
all over the place.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,
not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay
smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley
looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a
pig in a wig.
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult
as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his
presents.
His face fell.
"Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father. "That's two
less than last year."
"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here
under this big one from Mommy and Daddy."
"All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red in the face.
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing
down
his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,
"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's
that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''
Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said
slowly, "So I'll have thirty ... thirty..."
"Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia.
"Oh." Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. "All right
then."
Uncle Vernon chuckled. "Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like
his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it
while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a
video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and
a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia
came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
"Bad news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't
take him." She jerked her head in Harry's direction.
Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every
year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the
day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every
year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two
streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage
and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever
owned.
"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd
planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had
broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be
a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and
Tufty again.
"We could phone Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested.
"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy."
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't
there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't
understand them, like a slug.
"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?"
"On vacation in Majorca," snapped Aunt Petunia.
"You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to
watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a
go
on Dudley's computer).
Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.
"And come back and find the house in ruins?" she snarled.
"I won't blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren't listening.
"I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "...
and leave him in the car...."
"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...."
Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had
been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up
his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.
"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special
day!" she cried, flinging her arms around him.
"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled between huge,
pretend sobs. "He always sp- spoils everything!" He shot Harry a nasty
grin through the gap in his mother's arms.
Just then, the doorbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they're here!" said Aunt
Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers
Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face
like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their
backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in
the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the
zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able
to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle
Vernon had taken Harry aside.
"I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right up
close to Harry's, "I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business,
anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until
Christmas."
"I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly..
But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.
The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was
just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.
Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking
as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors
and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which
she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly
at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day,
where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.
Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it
had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week
in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he
couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.
Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting
old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she
tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until
finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit
Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to
his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.
On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on
the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as
usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was
sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter
from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school
buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon
through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash
cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have
caught him in mid- jump.
But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with
Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school,
his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to
complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the
bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,
it was motorcycles.
"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a
motorcycle overtook them.
I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly. "It
was flying."
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right
around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet
with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!"
Dudley and Piers sniggered.
I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only a dream."
But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the
Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking
about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a
dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous
ideas.
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The
Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the
entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry
what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a
cheap
lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,
except that it wasn't blond.
Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to
walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who
were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall
back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo
restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker
glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to
last.
After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in
there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts
of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and
stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick,
man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the
place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car
and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in
the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the
glistening brown coils.
"Make it move," he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the
glass, but the snake didn't budge.
"Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly
with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.
"This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He
wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no
company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying
to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a
bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door
to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised
its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.
It winked.
Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised
its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:
"I get that all the time.
"I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the
snake could hear him. "It must be really annoying."
The snake nodded vigorously.
"Where do you come from, anyway?" Harry asked.
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry
peered at it.
Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
"Was it nice there?"
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:
This specimen was bred in the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never been to
Brazil?"
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of
them jump.
"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT IT'S DOING!"
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.
"Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by
surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened
so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were
leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with
howls of horror.
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank
had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering
out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and
started running for the exits.
As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,
hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo."
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.
"But the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?"
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea
while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only
gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except
snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were
all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had
nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to
squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers
calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you,
Harry?"
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before
starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to
say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a
chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.
Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He
didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were
asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen
for some food.
He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as
long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents
had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when
his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during
long
hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding
flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he
supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green
light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and
uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask
questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.
When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some
unknown
relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the
Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe
hoped)
that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers
they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once
while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry
furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the
shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in
green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long
purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and
then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these
people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a
closer look.
At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated
that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and
nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.
CHAPTER THREE
THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE
The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his
longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard
again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his
new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time
out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet
Drive on her crutches.
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,
who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and
Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and
stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite
happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,
wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he
could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off
to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be
with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private
school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the
other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley
thought this was very funny.
"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,"
he told Harry. "Want to come upstairs and practice?"
"No, thanks," said Harry. "The poor toilet's never had anything as
horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick." Then he ran, before
Dudley could work out what he'd said.
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his
Smeltings
uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as
usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,
and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch
television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though
she'd had it for several years.
That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in
his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange
knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried
knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't
looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said
gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst
into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he
looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He
thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to
laugh.
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry
went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in
the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like
dirty rags swimming in gray water.
"What's this?" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always
did if he dared to ask a question.
"Your new school uniform," she said.
Harry looked in the bowl again.
"Oh," he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet."
"DotA be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's
old
things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've
finished."
Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat
down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look
on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old
elephant skin, probably.
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of
the
smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as
usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,
on the table.
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the
doormat.
"Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.
"Make Harry get it."
"Get the mail, Harry."
"Make Dudley get it."
"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley."
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things
lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who
was
vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a
bill, and -- a letter for Harry.
Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant
elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who
would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the
library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet
here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:
Mr. H. Potter
The Cupboard under the Stairs
4 Privet Drive
Little Whinging
Surrey
The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the
address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.
Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax
seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake
surrounding a large letter H.
"Hurry up, boy!" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. "What are you
doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled at his own joke.
Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed
Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to
open the yellow envelope.
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over
the postcard.
"Marge's ill," he informed Aunt Petunia. "Ate a funny whelk. --."
"Dad!" said Dudley suddenly. "Dad, Harry's got something!"
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the
same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of
his hand by Uncle Vernon.
"That's mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
"Who'd be writing to you?" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open
with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster
than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds
it was the grayish white of old porridge.
"P-P-Petunia!" he gasped.
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it
high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first
line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her
throat and made a choking noise.
"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!"
They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and
Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He
gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.
"I want to read that letter," he said loudly. want to read it," said
Harry furiously, "as it's mine."
"Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back
inside its envelope.
Harry didn't move.
I WANT MY LETTER!" he shouted.
"Let me see it!" demanded Dudley.
"OUT!" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the
scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the
kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,
his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at
the crack between door and floor.
"Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the
address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think
they're watching the house?"
"Watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered Uncle Vernon
wildly.
"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we
don't
want --"
Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the
kitchen.
"No," he said finally. "No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an
answer... Yes, that's best... we won't do anything....
"But --"
"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took
him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?"
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something
he'd
never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.
"Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed
through the door. "Who's writing to me?"
"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly.
"I have burned it."
"It was not a mistake," said Harry angrily, "it had my cupboard on it."
"SILENCE!" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the
ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a
smile, which looked quite painful.
"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been
thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might
be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.
"Why?" said Harry.
"Don't ask questions!" snapped his uncle. "Take this stuff upstairs,
now."
The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt
Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one
where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things
that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip
upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He
sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was
broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working
tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the
corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot
through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large
birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school
for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent
because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They
were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been
touched.
From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't
want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...."
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given
anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with
that letter than up here without it.
Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in
shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been
sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the
greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was
thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the
letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each
other darkly.
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice
to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with
his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, "There's
another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'"
With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the
hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the
ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact
that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After
a
minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the
Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with
Harry's letter clutched in his hand.
"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom," he wheezed at Harry.
"Dudley -- go -- just go."
Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had
moved out
of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first
letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure
they didn't fail. He had a plan.
The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry
turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the
Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and
get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept
across the dark hall toward the front door --
Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on
the doormat -- something alive!
Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the
big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been
lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making
sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He
shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make
a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the
time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.
Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.
I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into
pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He
stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.
"See," he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, "if
they can't deliver them they'll just give up."
"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon."
"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not
like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the
piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.
On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they
couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,
slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small
window in the downstairs bathroom.
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got
out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and
back doors so no one could go out. He hummed "Tiptoe Through the
Tulips"
as he worked, and jumped at small noises.
On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to
Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each
of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt
Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made
furious
telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone
to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.
"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley asked Harry in
amazement.
On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking
tired and rather ill, but happy.
"No post on Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he spread
marmalade
on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --"
Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and
caught
him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty
letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys
ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.
"Out! OUT!"
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their
faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters
still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.
"That does it," said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling
great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back
here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some
clothes. No arguments!"
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared
argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the
boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.
Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the
head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and
computer in his sports bag.
They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where
they
were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn
and
drive in the opposite direction for a while. "Shake'em off... shake 'em
off," he would mutter whenever he did this.
They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was
howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd
missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone
so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the
outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds
and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on
the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and
wondering....
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for
breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the
hotel came over to their table.
"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred
of these at the front desk."
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:
Mr. H. Potter
Room 17
Railview Hotel
Cokeworth
Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out
of the way. The woman stared.
"I'll take them," said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following
her from the dining room.
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested
timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly
what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the
middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in
the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle
of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of
a multilevel parking garage.
"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that
afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside
the car, and disappeared.
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley
sniveled.
"It's Monday," he told his mother. "The Great Humberto's on tonight. I
want to stay somewhere with a television. "
Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you
could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of
television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of
course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys
had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
Still, you weren't eleven every day.
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,
thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd
bought.
"Found the perfect place!" he said. "Come on! Everyone out!"
It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what
looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was
the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was
certain, there was no television in there.
"Storm forecast for tonight!" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his
hands together. "And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his
boat!"
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather
wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below
them.
"I've already got us some rations," said Uncle Vernon, "so all aboard!"
It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their
necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like
hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,
led the way to the broken-down house.
The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind
whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was
damp and empty. There were only two rooms.
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four
bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked
and shriveled up.
"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?" he said cheerfully.
He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a
chance
of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately
agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the
high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the
filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second
room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and
Uncle
Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find
the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,
most ragged blanket.
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry
couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable,
his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the
low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of
Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat
wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and
watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would
remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the
roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.
Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of
letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.
Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like
that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was
the rock crumbling into the sea?
One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...
nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...
one...
BOOM.
The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the
door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.
CHAPTER FOUR
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. "Where's the
cannon?" he
said stupidly.
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the
room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been
in the long, thin package he had brought with them.
"Who's there?" he shouted. "I warn you -- I'm armed!"
There was a pause. Then --
SMASH!
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and
with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost
completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled
beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles
under all the hair.
The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just
brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it
easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a
little. He turned to look at them all.
"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy
journey..."
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.
"Budge up, yeh great lump," said the stranger.
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,
terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
"An' here's Harry!" said the giant.
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the
beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby," said the giant. "Yeh look a
lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes."
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
I demand that you leave at once, sit!" he said. "You are breaking and
entering!"
"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant; he reached over
the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent
it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it
into a corner of the room.
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
"Anyway -- Harry," said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, "a
very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on
it at some point, but it'll taste all right."
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly
squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a
large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in
green icing.
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words
got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, "Who are
you?"
The giant chuckled.
"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts."
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.
"What about that tea then, eh?" he said, rubbing his hands together.
"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind."
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and
he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he
was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire
there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt
the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.
The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and
began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a
copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several
chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from
before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and
smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was
working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt
sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said
sharply, "Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley."
The giant chuckled darkly.
"Yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don'
worry."
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the
giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,
"I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are."
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand.
"Call me Hagrid," he said, "everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm
Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.
"Er -- no," said Harry.
Hagrid looked shocked.
"Sorry," Harry said quickly.
"Sony?" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back
into the shadows. "It' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't
gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou'
Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents
learned it all?"
"All what?" asked Harry.
"ALL WHAT?" Hagrid thundered. "Now wait jus' one second!"
He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.
The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.
"Do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this boy --
this boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?"
Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after
all, and his marks weren't bad.
"I know some things," he said. "I can, you know, do math and stuff." But
Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "About our world, I mean. Your
world. My world. Yer parents' world."
"What world?"
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.
"DURSLEY!" he boomed.
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that
sounded
like "Mimblewimble." Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad," he said. "I mean, they're
famous. You're famous."
"What? My -- my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?"
"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his
hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
"Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally.
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
"Stop!" he commanded. "Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the
boy anything!"
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious
look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable
trembled
with rage.
"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore
left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An'
you've kept it from him all these years?"
"Kept what from me?" said Harry eagerly.
"STOP! I FORBID YOU!" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.
"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh," said Hagrid. "Harry -- yet a
wizard."
There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind
could be heard.
"-- a what?" gasped Harry.
"A wizard, o' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which
groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once
yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else
would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter."
Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,
addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,
The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:
HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme
Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)
Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all
necessary books and equipment.
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.
Yours sincerely,
Minerva McGonagall,
Deputy Headmistress
Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't
decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, "What does
it mean, they await my owl?"
"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me," said Hagrid, clapping a hand to
his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet
another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live,
rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could
read upside down:
Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter.
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather's horrible. Hope you're Well.
Hagrid
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its
beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he
came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the
telephone.
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.
"Where was I?" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still
ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
"He's not going," he said.
Hagrid grunted.
"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him," he said.
"A what?" said Harry, interested.
"A Muggle," said Hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.
An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I
ever laid eyes on."
"We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish," said
Uncle Vernon, "swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!"
"You knew?" said Harry. "You knew I'm a -- a wizard?"
"Knew!" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. "Knew! Of course we knew!
How
could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a
letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came
home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups
into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak!
But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,
they were proud of having a witch in the family!"
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed
she had been wanting to say all this for years.
"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and
had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange,
just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up and we got landed with you!"
Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, "Blown
up? You told me they died in a car crash!"
"CAR CRASH!" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys
scuttled back to their corner. "How could a car crash kill Lily an'
James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his
own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" "But why? What
happened?" Harry asked urgently.
The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious.
"I never expected this," he said, in a low, worried voice. "I had no
idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of
yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right
person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter
Hogwarts not knowin'."
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.
"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't
tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...."
He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It
begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible
yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows --"
"Who? "
"Well -- I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does."
"Why not?"
"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is
difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you
could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was..."
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
"Could you write it down?" Harry suggested.
"Nah -can't spell it. All right -- Voldemort. " Hagrid shuddered. "Don'
make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years
ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too -- some were
afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin'
himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust,
didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible
things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him --
an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was
Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid
of.
Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway.
"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew.
Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why
You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew
they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the
Dark Side.
"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wanted 'em
outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where
you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old.
He came ter yer house an' -- an' --"
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew
his nose with a sound like a foghorn.
"Sorry," he said. "But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer
people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..."
"You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of
the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of
it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't
do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was
no
ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches
yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't
work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after
he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the
best witches an' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the
Prewetts -- an' you was only a baby, an' you lived."
Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story
came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more
clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered
something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel
laugh.
Hagrid was watching him sadly.
"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders.
Brought
yeh ter this lot..."
"Load of old tosh," said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost
forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to
have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were
clenched.
"Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something
strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured
-- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no
denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion --
asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types --
just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --"
But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink
umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a
sword, he said, "I'm warning you, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more
word... "
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,
Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the
wall and fell silent.
"That's better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on
the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.
"But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?"
"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter
kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see...
he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go?
"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough
human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his
time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back
ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. reckon they
could've done if he was comin' back.
"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers.
Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry.
There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on -- I dunno
what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all
right."
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but
Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had
been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd
spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and
Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned
into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If
he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley
had always been able to kick him around like a football?
"Hagrid," he said quietly, "I think you must have made a mistake. I
don't think I can be a wizard."
To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or
angry?"
Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd
thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had
happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's
gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going
to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow
back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his
revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa
constrictor on him?
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively
beaming at him.
"See?" said Hagrid. "Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be
right famous at Hogwarts."
But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.
"Haven't I told you he's not going?" he hissed. "He's going to Stonewall
High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs
all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --"
"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him," growled
Hagrid. "Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad.
His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest
school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he
won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a
change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had
Albus Dumbled--"
"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH
HIM MAGIC TRICKS!"
yelled Uncle Vernon.
But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled
it over his head, "NEVER," he thundered, "- INSULT- ALBUSDUMBLEDOREIN- FRONT- OF- ME!"
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley
-- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a
sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with
his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned
his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in
his trousers.
Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other
room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door
behind them.
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.
"Shouldn'ta lost me temper," he said ruefully, "but it didn't work
anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like
a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do."
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.
"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts," he
said. "I'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was
allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff
-- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job
"Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" asked Harry.
"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter
tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an'
everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man,
Dumbledore." "Why were you expelled?"
"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow," said Hagrid
loudly. "Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that."
He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.
"You can kip under that," he said. "Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I
think I still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets."
CHAPTER FIVE
DIAGON ALLEY
Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.
"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. "I dreamed a giant called
Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open
my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard."
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.
And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart
sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good
dream.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
"All right," Harry mumbled, "I'm getting up."
He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of
sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed
sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper
held in its beak.
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon
was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it
open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid,
who
didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to
attack Hagrid's coat.
"Don't do that."
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak
fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.
"Hagrid!" said Harry loudly. "There's an owl
"Pay him," Hagrid grunted into the sofa.
"What?"
"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets."
Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of
keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...
finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.
"Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleepily.
"Knuts?"
"The little bronze ones."
Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg
so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then
he flew off through the open window.
Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.
"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy
all yer stuff fer school."
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just
thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon
inside him had got a puncture.
"Um -- Hagrid?"
"Mm?" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
"I haven't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he
won't pay for me to go and learn magic."
"Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his
head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?"
"But if their house was destroyed --"
"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is
Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I
wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither."
"Wizards have banks?"
"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins."
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.
"Goblins?"
"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never
mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer
anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o'
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts
business." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. "He usually gets me ter do
important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts --
knows he can trust me, see.
"Got everythin'? Come on, then."
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and
the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was
still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.
"How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.
"Flew," said Hagrid.
"Flew?"
"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've
got yeh."
They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to
imagine him flying.
"Seems a shame ter row, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of
his sideways looks. "If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would
yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?"
"Of course not," said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out
the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and
they sped off toward land.
"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry asked.
"Spells -- enchantments," said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he
spoke. "They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And
then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under
London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter
get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat."
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the
Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to
be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never
had so many questions in his life.
"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered, turning
the page.
"There's a Ministry of Magic?" Harry asked, before he could stop
himself.
"'Course," said Hagrid. "They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 '
course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the
job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls
every morning, askin' fer advice."
"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?"
"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still
witches an' wizards up an' down the country."
"Why?"
"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their
problems. Nah, we're best left alone."
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid
folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the
street.
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town
to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as
tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like
parking meters and saying loudly, "See that, Harry? Things these Muggles
dream up, eh?"
"Hagrid," said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say
there are dragons at Gringotts?"
"Well, so they say," said Hagrid. "Crikey, I'd like a dragon."
"You'd like one?"
"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go."
They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five
minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he
called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.
People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and
sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.
"Still got yer letter, Harry?" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry
took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.
"Good," said Hagrid. "There's a list there of everything yeh need."
Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night
before, and read:

"Can we buy all this in London?" Harry wondered aloud.
"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid.
Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know
where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an
ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and
complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic," he said as they
climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined
with shops.
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do
was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,
hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it
could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of
ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles
beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and
broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had
cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of
humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything
Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help
trusting him.
"This is it," said Hagrid, coming to a halt, "the Leaky Cauldron. It's a
famous place."
It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out,
Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't
glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the
record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at
all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and
Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered
him inside.
For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were
sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was
smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old
bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The
low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to
know
Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a
glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?"
"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great
hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.
"Good Lord," said the bartender, peering at Harry, "is this -- can this
be --?"
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
"Bless my soul," whispered the old bartender, "Harry Potter... what an
honor."
He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his
hand, tears in his eyes.
"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."
Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old
woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.
Hagrid was beaming.
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry
found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.
"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last."
"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud."
"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter."
"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus
Diggle."
"I've seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off
in his excitement. "You bowed to me once in a shop."
"He remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. "Did
you hear that? He remembers me!" Harry shook hands again and again --
Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.
A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes
was twitching.
"Professor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. "Harry, Professor Quirrell will be
one of your teachers at Hogwarts."
"P-P-Potter," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand,
"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you."
"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?"
"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts," muttered Professor Quirrell, as
though he'd rather not think about it. "N-not that you n-need it, eh,
P-P-Potter?" He laughed nervously. "You'll be g-getting all your
equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,
m-myself." He looked terrified at the very thought.
But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It
took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid
managed to make himself heard over the babble.
"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry."
Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them
through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was
nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell
was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'."
"Is he always that nervous?"
"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was
studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand
experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there
was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.
Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me
umbrella?"
Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was
counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.
"Three up... two across he muttered. "Right, stand back, Harry."
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.
The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a
small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they
were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a
cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
"Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley."
He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway.
Harry
looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly
back into solid wall.
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.
Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring
-- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.
"Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money
first."
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every
direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at
once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their
shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head
as
they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're
mad...."
A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops
Owl
Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of
about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with
broomsticks in it. "Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus
Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops
selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen
before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes,
tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion
bottles, globes of the moon....
"Gringotts," said Hagrid.
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other
little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a
uniform of scarlet and gold, was -
"Yeah, that's a goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white
stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.
He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very
long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were
facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved
upon them:
Enter, stranger, but take heed
Of what awaits the sin of greed,
For those who take, but do not earn,
Must pay most dearly in their turn.
So if you seek beneath our floors
A treasure that was never yours,
Thief, you have been warned, beware
Of finding more than treasure there.
"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it," said Hagrid.
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a
vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high
stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing
coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.
There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more
goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made
for the counter.
"Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter take some
money
outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe."
"You have his key, Sir?"
"Got it here somewhere," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his
pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits
over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry
watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as
glowing coals.
"Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.
The goblin looked at it closely.
"That seems to be in order."
"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid
importantly, throwing out his chest. "It's about the YouKnow-What in
vault seven hundred and thirteen."
The goblin read the letter carefully.
"Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone
take you down to both vaults. Griphook!"
Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog
biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward
one of the doors leading off the hall.
"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry
asked.
"Can't tell yeh that," said Hagrid mysteriously. "Very secret. Hogwarts
business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh
that."
Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more
marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with
flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little
railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came
hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some
difficulty -- and were off.
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry
tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,
but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,
because Griphook wasn't steering.
Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them
wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a
passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -
they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge
stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,
"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?"
"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. "An' don' ask me questions
just now, I think I'm gonna be sick."
He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small
door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the
wall to stop his knees from trembling.
Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out,
and
as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns
of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.
"All yours," smiled Hagrid.
All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about
this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had
they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time
there
had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.
"The gold ones are Galleons," he explained. "Seventeen silver Sickles to
a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right,
that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe
for yeh." He turned to Griphook. "Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,
please, and can we go more slowly?"
"One speed only," said Griphook.
They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became
colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went
rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to
try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and
pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.
"Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with
one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.
"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through
the door and trapped in there," said Griphook.
"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?" Harry asked.
"About once every ten years," said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,
Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous
jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then
he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on
the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry
longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.
"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way
back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut," said Hagrid.
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside
Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag
full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a
pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his
whole
life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.
"Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam
Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. "Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I
slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them
Gringotts carts." He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam
Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.
"Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Harry started to speak. "Got the lot
here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. "
In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on
a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam
Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his
head, and began to pin it to the right length.
"Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?"
"Yes," said Harry.
"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street
looking at wands," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "Then
I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why
first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting
me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow."
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.
"Have you got your own broom?" the boy went on.
"No," said Harry.
"Play Quidditch at all?"
"No," Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.
"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my
house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?"
"No," said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know
I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in
Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" "Mmm," said Harry, wishing
he could say something a bit more interesting.
"I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the
front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing
at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.
"That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.
"He works at Hogwarts."
"Oh," said the boy, "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't
he?"
"He's the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the
school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,
and ends up setting fire to his bed."
"I think he's brilliant," said Harry coldly.
"Do you?" said the boy, with a slight sneer. "Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?"
"They're dead," said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into
the matter with this boy.
"Oh, sorry," said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. "But they were
our kind, weren't they?"
"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean."
"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're
just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some
of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,
imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.
What's your surname, anyway?"
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my
dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,
hopped down from the footstool.
"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," said the drawling boy.
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him
(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
"What's up?" said Hagrid.
"Nothing," Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry
cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you
wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?"
"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin'
about Quidditch!"
"Don't make me feel worse," said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate
boy in Madam Malkin's.
"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed
in."
"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown
up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what
everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway,
what
does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones
with magic in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look
what she had fer a sister!"
"So what is Quidditch?"
"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle
world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on
broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules."
"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?"
"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'
duffers, but --"
"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff" said Harry gloomily.
"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. "There's not a
single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
You-Know-Who was one."
"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?"
"Years an' years ago," said Hagrid.
They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as
paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in
covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with
nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have
been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag
Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and
Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,
Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley."
"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the
Muggle world except in very special circumstances," said Hagrid. "An'
anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more
study before yeh get ter that level."
Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("It says
pewter on yer list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing
potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited
the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible
smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff
stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined
the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung
from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a
supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself
examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and
minuscule,
glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.
"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday
present."
Harry felt himself go red.
"You don't have to --"
"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad,
toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don'
like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want
owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'."
Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been
dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now
carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with
her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks,
sounding just like Professor Quirrell.
"Don' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you've had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer
wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand."
A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door
read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay
on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped
inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair
that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had
entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that
had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow
boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of
his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle
with some secret magic.
"Good afternoon," said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have
jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly
off the spindly chair.
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like
moons through the gloom of the shop.
"Hello," said Harry awkwardly.
"Ah yes," said the man. "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon.
Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It
seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm
work."
Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink.
Those
silvery eyes were a bit creepy.
"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches.
Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I
say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the
wizard, of course."
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to
nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.
"And that's where..."
Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a
long, white finger.
"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly.
"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in
the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into
the world to do...."
He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.
"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?"
"It was, sir, yes," said Hagrid.
"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
expelled?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
"Er -- yes, they did, yes," said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. "I've still
got the pieces, though," he added brightly.
"But you don't use them?" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
"Oh, no, sit," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
"Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. "Well, now
-- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He pulled a long tape measure with silver
markings out of his pocket. "Which is your wand arm?"
"Er -- well, I'm right-handed," said Harry.
"Hold out your arm. That's it." He measured Harry from shoulder to
finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round
his head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand has a core of
a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix
tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands
are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite
the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with
another wizard's wand."
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring
between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was
flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
"That will do," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on
the floor. "Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a
wave."
Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.
Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.
"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --"
Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was
snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.
Go on, go on, try it out."
Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting
for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the
spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the
shelves, the happier he seemed to become.
"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here
somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination --
holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."
Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised
the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air
and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,
throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and
clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very
good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "
He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,
still muttering, "Curious... curious..
"Sorry," said Harry, "but what's curious?"
Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.
"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It
so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave
another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you
should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave
you that scar."
Harry swallowed.
"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things
happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must
expect
great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, HeWho-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great."
Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid
seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from
his
shop.
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made
their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through
the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked
down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at
them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped
packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up
another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized
where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.
"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves," he said.
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat
them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.
"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet," said Hagrid.
Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of
his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the
words.
"Everyone thinks I'm special," he said at last. "All those people in the
Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know
anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm
famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what
happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died."
Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he
wore a very kind smile.
"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the
beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's
hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a
great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact."
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the
Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.
"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross
-- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a
letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,
Harry."
The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until
he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against
the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.
CHAPTER SIX
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so
scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia
and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do
anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry
in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did
become a bit depressing after a while.
Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to
call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school
books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the
night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It
was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because
Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to
sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned
to the wall, counting down to September the first.
On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and
uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went
down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on
television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and
Dudley screamed and ran from the room.
"Er -- Uncle Vernon?"
Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.
"Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts."
Uncle Vernon grunted again.
"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?"
Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.
"Thank you."
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.
"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got
punctures, have they?"
Harry didn't say anything.
"Where is this school, anyway?"
"I don't know," said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled
the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.
"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven
o'clock," he read.
His aunt and uncle stared.
"Platform what?"
"Nine and three-quarters."
"Don't talk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. "There is no platform nine and
three-quarters."
"It's on my ticket."
"Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see.
You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up
to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother."
"Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to keep things
friendly.
"Taking Dudley to the hospital," growled Uncle Vernon. "Got to have that
ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings."
Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and
nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because
he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd
change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure
he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her
cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two
hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the
Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to
Harry, and they had set off.
They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought
this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the
platforms with a nasty grin on his face.
"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it
yet, do they?"
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over
one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and
in the middle, nothing at all.
"Have a good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He
left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.
All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on
earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny
looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone.
He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and
three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry
couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to
get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting
desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but
the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away,
muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes
left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he
was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly
lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like
tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He
wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket
inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
"-- packed with Muggles, of course --"
Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to
four
boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like
Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.
Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so
did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.
"Now, what's the platform number?" said the boys' mother.
"Nine and three-quarters!" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was
holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go... "
"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go
first."
What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.
Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as
the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large
crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last
backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.
"Fred, you next," the plump woman said.
"I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy. "Honestly, woman, you call
yourself our mother? CarA you tell I'm George?"
"Sorry, George, dear."
"Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy, and off he went. His twin called
after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later,
he had gone -- but how had he done it?
Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was
almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.
There was nothing else for it.
"Excuse me," Harry said to the plump woman.
"Hello, dear," she said. "First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too."
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and
gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
"Yes," said Harry. "The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to
--"
"How to get onto the platform?" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.
"Not to worry," she said. "All you have to do is walk straight at the
barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared
you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a
run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron."
"Er -- okay," said Harry.
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very
solid.
He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to
platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to
smash
right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward
on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer
and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control
-- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --
It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet
steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign
overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind
him
and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,
while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls
hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and
the scraping of heavy trunks.
The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging
out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.
Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.
He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I've lost my toad
again."
"Oh, Neville," he heard the old woman sigh.
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
"Give us a look, Lee, go on."
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him
shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment
near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started
to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it
up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it
painfully on his foot.
"Want a hand?" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through
the barrier.
"Yes, please," Harry panted.
"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!"
With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner
of the compartment.
"Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.
"What's that?" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's
lightning scar.
"Blimey," said the other twin. "Are you
"He is," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" he added to Harry.
"What?" said Harry.
"Harry Potter, "chorused the twins.
"Oh, him," said Harry. "I mean, yes, I am."
The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to
his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.
"Fred? George? Are you there?"
"Coming, Mom."
With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.
Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the
red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their
mother had just taken out her handkerchief.
"Ron, you've got something on your nose."
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and
began rubbing the end of his nose.
"Mom -- geroff" He wriggled free.
"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?" said one of the
twins.
"Shut up," said Ron.
"Where's Percy?" said their mother.
"He's coming now."
The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his
billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge
on his chest with the letter P on it.
"Can't stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up front, the prefects have got
two compartments to themselves --"
"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of
great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea."
"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the
other twin. "Once --"
"Or twice --"
"A minute --"
"All summer --"
"Oh, shut up," said Percy the Prefect.
"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said one of the twins.
"Because he's a prefect," said their mother fondly. "All right, dear,
well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there."
She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.
"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl
telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --"
"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet."
"Great idea though, thanks, Mom."
"It's not funny. And look after Ron."
"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us."
"Shut up," said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already
and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.
"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?"
Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.
"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know
who
he is?"
"Who?"
"Harry Potter!"
Harry heard the little girl's voice.
"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...."
"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you
goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?"
"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning."
"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite
when he asked how to get onto the platform."
"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks
like?"
Their mother suddenly became very stern.
"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs
reminding of that on his first day at school."
"All right, keep your hair on."
A whistle sounded.
"Hurry up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the
train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and
their younger sister began to cry.
"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls."
"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat."
"George!"
"Only joking, Mom."
The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their
sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train
until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the
corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of
excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better
than what he was leaving behind.
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy
came in.
"Anyone sitting there?" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.
"Everywhere else is full."
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then
looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw
he still had a black mark on his nose.
"Hey, Ron."
The twins were back.
"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a
giant tarantula down there."
"Right," mumbled Ron.
"Harry," said the other twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and
George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.
"Bye," said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut
behind them.
"Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out.
Harry nodded.
"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said
Ron. "And have you really got -- you know..."
He pointed at Harry's forehead.
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.
"So that's where You-Know-Who
"Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it."
"Nothing?" said Ron eagerly.
"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else."
"Wow," said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as
though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out
of the window again.
"Are all your family wizards?" asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
"Er -- Yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second cousin
who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."
"So you must know loads of magic already."
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale
boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.
"I heard you went to live with Muggles," said Ron. "What are they like?"
"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers."
"Five," said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. "I'm the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up
to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie
was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess
around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks
they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,
but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get
anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes,
Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat."
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was
asleep.
"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy
got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff
-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."
Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he
went back to staring out of the window.
Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to
afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a
month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old
clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer
Ron up.
"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a
wizard or about my parents or Voldemort"
Ron gasped.
"What?" said Harry.
"You said You-Know-Who's name!" said Ron, sounding both shocked and
impressed. "I'd have thought you, of all people --"
"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said Harry, I
just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to
learn.... I bet," he added, voicing for the first time something that
had been worrying him a lot lately, "I bet I'm the worst in the class."
"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families
and
they learn quick enough."
While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were
quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the
corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,
"Anything off the cart, dears?"
Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears
went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went
out into the corridor.
He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he
had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many
Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What
she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best
Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes,
Licorice
Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his
life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid
the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped
it onto an empty seat.
"Hungry, are you?"
"Starving," said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four
sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, "She always
forgets I don't like corned beef."
"Swap you for one of these," said Harry, holding up a pasty. "Go on --"
"You don't want this, it's all dry," said Ron. "She hasn't got much
time," he added quickly, "you know, with five of us."
"Go on, have a pasty," said Harry, who had never had anything to share
before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,
sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,
cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
"What are these?" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate
Frogs.
"They're not really frogs, are they?" He was starting to feel that
nothing would surprise him.
"No," said Ron. "But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa."
"What?"
"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside
them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about
five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy."
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a
man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and
flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the
name Albus Dumbledore.
"So this is Dumbledore!" said Harry.
"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!" said Ron. "Can I have a
frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks
Harry turned over his card and read:
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS
Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is
particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in
1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore
enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that
Dumbledore's face had disappeared.
"He's gone!"
"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day," said Ron. "He'll be
back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you
want it? You can start collecting."
Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be
unwrapped.
"Help yourself," said Harry. "But in, you know, the Muggle world, people
just stay put in photos."
"Do they? What, they don't move at all?" Ron sounded amazed. "weird!"
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and
gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than
looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't
keep
his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but
Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was
scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.
"You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. "When they say
every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the
ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then
you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a boogerflavored one once."
Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a
corner.
"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts."
They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,
coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was
even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't
touch, which turned out to be pepper.
The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The
neat
fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green
hills.
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced
boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He
looked tearful.
"Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?"
When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting
away from me!"
"He'll turn up," said Harry.
"Yes," said the boy miserably. "Well, if you see him..."
He left.
"Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron. "If I'd brought a toad I'd
lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't
talk."
The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.
"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said Ron in
disgust. "I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more
interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look..."
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking
wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the
end.
"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway
He had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again.
The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was
already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.
"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one," she said. She had a bossy
sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.
"We've already told him we haven't seen it," said Ron, but the girl
wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.
"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then."
She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.
"Er -- all right."
He cleared his throat.
"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."
He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast
asleep.
"Are you sure that's a real spell?" said the girl. "Well, it's not very
good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's
all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such
a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I
mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard --
I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it
will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.
She said all this very fast.
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he
hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.
"I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered.
"Harry Potter," said Harry.
"Are you really?" said Hermione. "I know all about you, of course -- I
got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern
Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great
Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.
"Am I?" said Harry, feeling dazed.
"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it
was me," said Hermione. "Do either of you know what house you'll be in?
I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far
the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw
wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's
toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there
soon."
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.
"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it," said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. "Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he
knew it was a dud."
"What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry.
"Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mom
and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I
don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin."
"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?"
"Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,"
said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. "So what do your
oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?"
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.
"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing
something for Gringotts," said Ron. "Did you hear about
Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you
get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security
vault."
Harry stared.
"Really? What happened to them?"
"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My
dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts,
but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course,
everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case
You-Know-Who's behind it."
Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a
prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed
this
was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more
comfortable saying "Voldemort" without worrying.
"What's your Quidditch team?" Ron asked.
"Er -- I don't know any," Harry confessed.
"What!" Ron looked dumbfounded. "Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the
world --" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to
with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the
money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game
when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the
toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry
with
a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.
"Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry
Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?"
"Yes," said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale
boy, they looked like bodyguards.
"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," said the pale boy carelessly,
noticing where Harry was looking. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco
Malfoy."
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco
Malfoy looked at him.
"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father
told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than
they can afford."
He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families
are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.
"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," he said
coolly.
Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale
cheeks.
"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you're a
bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know
what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the
Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."
Both Harry and Ron stood up.
"Say that again," Ron said, his face as red as his hair.
"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered.
"Unless you get out now," said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because
Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.
"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food
and you still seem to have some."
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt
forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a
horrible yell.
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk
deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle
swung
Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off
and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they
thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd
heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
"What has been going on?" she said, looking at the sweets all over the
floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.
I think he's been knocked out," Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at
Scabbers. "No -- I don't believe it -- he's gone back to sleep-"
And so he had.
"You've met Malfoy before?"
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.
"I've heard of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were some of the
first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said
they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's
father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side." He turned to
Hermione. "Can we help you with something?"
"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the
front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't
been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!"
"Scabbers has been fighting, not us," said Ron, scowling at her. "Would
you mind leaving while we change?"
"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving
very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a
sniffy voice. "And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you
know?"
Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was
getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple
sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.
Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath
them.
A voice echoed through the train: "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five
minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken
to the school separately."
Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under
his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and
joined the crowd thronging the corridor.
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way
toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in
the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the
students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years
over here! All right there, Harry?"
Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
"C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs'
years follow me!"
Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a
steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry
thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the
boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.
"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over
his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."
There was a loud "Oooooh!"
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.
Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in
the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.
"No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little
boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed
into their boat by Neville and Hermione. "Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid,
who had a boat to himself. "Right then -- FORWARD!"
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the
lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at
the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer
and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
"Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they
all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain
of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried
along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the
castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they
clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.
"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?" said Hagrid, who was checking the
boats as people climbed out of them.
"Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they
clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at
last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.
They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak
front door.
"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?"
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle
door.
CHAPTER SEVEN
THE SORTING HAT
The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green
robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought
was that this was not someone to cross.
"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid.
"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."
She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have
fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit
with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too
high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to
the upper floors.
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry
could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right
-the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall
showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They
crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have
done, peering about nervously.
"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great
Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very
important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be
something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with
the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free
time in your house common room.
"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your
triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose
house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is
awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a
credit to whichever house becomes yours.
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the
rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as
you can while you are waiting."
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
"I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall.
"Please wait quietly."
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.
"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron.
"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he
was joking."
Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole
school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have
to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.
He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,
too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was
whispering
very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one
she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more
nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to
the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He
kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall
would come back and lead him to his doom.
Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air --
several people behind him screamed.
"What the --?"
He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just
streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,
they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing
at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat
little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him
a second chance --"
"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He
gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I
say, what are you all doing here?"
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.
Nobody answered.
"New students!" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. "About to be
Sorted, I suppose?"
A few people nodded mutely.
"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. "My old house, you
know."
"Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to
start."
Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away
through the opposite wall.
"Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and
follow me."
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line
behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out
of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors
into the Great Hall.
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was
lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair
over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the
top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a
halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the
flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the
ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry
looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He
heard
Hermione whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read
about it in Hogwarts, A History."
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the
Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed
a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she
put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,
that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was
now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there
was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened
wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:
"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
But don't judge on what you see,
I'll eat myself if you can find
A smarter hat than me.
You can keep your bowlers black,
Your top hats sleek and tall,
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
And I can cap them all.
There's nothing hidden in your head
The Sorting Hat can't see,
So try me on and I will tell you
Where you ought to be.
You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,
Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
if you've a ready mind,
Where those of wit and learning,
Will always find their kind;
Or perhaps in Slytherin
You'll make your real friends,
Those cunning folk use any means
To achieve their ends.
So put me on! Don't be afraid!
And don't get in a flap!
You're in safe hands (though I have none)
For I'm a Thinking Cap!"
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It
bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.
"So we've just got to try on the hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. "I'll
kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll."
Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than
having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on
without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot;
Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If
only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy,
that would have been the one for him.
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of
parchment.
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to
be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the
hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause
--
"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat.
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at
the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving
merrily at her.
"Bones, Susan!"
"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next
to Hannah.
"Boot, Terry!"
"RAVENCLAW!"
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws
stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
" Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender"
became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded
with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.
"Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's
imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they
looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick
now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.
He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but
because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.
"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!"
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at
others it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus," the
sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost
a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
"Granger, Hermione!"
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when
you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just
sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor
McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a
mistake and he'd better get back on the train?
When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called,
he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide
with Neville. When it finally shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran off
still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it
to "MacDougal, Morag."
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at
once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed,
"SLYTHERIN!"
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with
himself.
There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a
pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and
then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!"
As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little
hissing fires all over the hall.
"Potter, did she say?"
The Harry Potter?"
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the
hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he
was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty
of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness,
yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....
So where shall I put you?"
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.
"Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be
great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you
on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure
-- better be GRYFFINDOR!"
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off
the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so
relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed
that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and
shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got
Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff
he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden,
horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat
Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned
back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,
sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd
gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair
was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the
ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man
from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple
turban.
And now there were only three people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean,"
a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
"Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was
pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a
second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!"
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next
to him.
"Well done, Ron, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry
as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled
up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how
hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students,
his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to
see them all there.
"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we
begin
our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!
Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
"Thank you!"
He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know
whether to laugh or not.
"Is he -- a bit mad?" he asked Percy uncertainly.
"Mad?" said Percy airily. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But
he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?"
Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with
food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table:
roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon
and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding,
peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint
humbugs.
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been
allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything
that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his
plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.
It was all delicious.
"That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry
cut up his steak,
"Can't you --?"
I haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years," said the ghost. "I don't
need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've in troduced
myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost
of Gryffindor Tower."
"I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. "My brothers told me about
you
-- you're Nearly Headless Nick!"
"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --" the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?"
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't
going at all the way he wanted.
"Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His
whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on
a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it
properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly
Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,
"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house
championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without
winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody
Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost."
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost
sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained
with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to
see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
"How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest.
"I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food
faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment
later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you
could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam
doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- "
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their
families.
"I'm half-and-half," said Seamus. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell
him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock
for him."
The others laughed.
"What about you, Neville?" said Ron.
"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the
family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept
trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but
nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for
dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles
when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally
let
go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They
were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you
should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might
not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased
he bought me my toad."
On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about
lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm
particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something
into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-";
"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of
thing -- ").
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at
the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor
Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy
black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's
turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across
the scar on Harry's forehead.
"Ouch!" Harry clapped a hand to his head.
"What is it?" asked Percy.
"N-nothing."
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he
didn't like Harry at all.
"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy.
"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so
nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want
to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about
the Dark Arts, Snape."
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to
his feet again. The hall fell silent.
"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to
all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember
that as well."
Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley
twins.
"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all
that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.
"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor
on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to
die a very painful death."
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
"He's not serious?" he muttered to Percy.
"Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. "It's odd, because he
usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the
forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he
might have told us prefects, at least."
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried
Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become
rather fixed.
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a
fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose
high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
"Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!"
And the school bellowed:
"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
Teach us something please,
Whether we be old and bald
Or young with scabby knees,
Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff,
For now they're bare and full of air,
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
So teach us things worth knowing,
Bring back what we've forgot,
just do your best, we'll do the rest,
And learn until our brains all rot.
Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the
Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they
had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!
And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds,
out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were
like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He
was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits
along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice
Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and
hanging
tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their
feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when
they came to a sudden halt.
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as
Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.
"Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised
his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself"
A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?"
There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide
mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking
sticks.
"Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! What fun!"
He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.
"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!" barked
Percy.
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on
Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as
he passed.
"You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again.
"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even
listen to us prefects. Here we are."
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a
pink silk dress.
"Password?" she said. "Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait
swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled
through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the
Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the
boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were
obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five
four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had
already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their
pajamas and fell into bed.
" Great food, isn't it?" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets."
Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he
fell asleep almost at once.
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange
dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to
him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was
his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it
got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened
painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with
it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh
became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke,
sweating and shaking.
He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he
didn't remember the dream at all.
CHAPTER EIGHT
THE POTIONS MASTER
There, look."
"Where?"
"Next to the tall kid with the red hair."
"Wearing the glasses?"
"Did you see his face?"
"Did you see his scar?"
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next
day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look
at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.
Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on
finding his way to classes.
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different
on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to
remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you
asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors
that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It
was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all
seemed
to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit
each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.
The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of
them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly
Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right
direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a
trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would
drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet,
pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab
your nose, and screech, "GOT YOUR CONK!"
Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus
Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their
very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a
door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds
corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was
sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening
to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor
Quirrell, who was passing.
Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature
with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the
corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of
line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds
later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than
anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly
as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest
ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.
And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes
themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,
than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every
Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the
movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the
greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little
witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of
all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.
Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only
one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old
indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got
up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on
and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the
Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had
to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their
first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he
gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a
talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.
"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts," she said. "Anyone messing around in my class
will leave and not come back. You have been warned."
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very
impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they
weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match
and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson,
only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor
McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and
gave Hermione a rare smile.
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense
Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of
a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said
was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be
coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had
been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of
a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell
had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about
the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung
around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed
full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone
else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't
had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to
learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to
find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost
once.
"What have we got today?" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his
porridge.
"Double Potions with the Slytherins," said Ron. "Snape's Head of
Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see
if it's true."
"Wish McGonagall favored us, " said Harry. Professor McGonagall was
head
of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge
pile of homework the day before.
Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but
it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a
hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,
circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters
and packages onto their laps.
Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to
nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the
owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered
down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto
Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy
scrawl:
Dear Harry,
I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have
a cup of tea with me around three?
I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with
Hedwig.
Hagrid
Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the
back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because
the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to
him so far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor
Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd
been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder
here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough
without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and
like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.
"Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity."
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their
hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His
eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of
potionmaking," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but
they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught
every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a
class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand-waving
here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you
will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with
its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through
human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach
you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."
More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks
with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and
looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.
"Potter!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if I added powdered
root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who
looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.
"I don't know, sit," said Harry.
Snape's lips curled into a sneer.
"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything."
He ignored Hermione's hand.
"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me
a bezoar?"
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without
her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a
bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were
shaking with laughter.
"I don't know, sit." "Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming,
eh, Potter?" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those
cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did
Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical
Herbs
and Fungi?
Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.
"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"
At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon
ceiling.
"I don't know," said Harry quietly. "I think Hermione does, though, why
don't you try her?"
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.
Snape, however, was not pleased.
"Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. "For your information, Potter,
asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known
as
the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach
of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and
wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of
aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,
Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your
cheek, Potter."
Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson
continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a
simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,
watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing
almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just
telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned
slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the
dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a
twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor,
burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was
standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the
potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils
sprang up all over his arms and legs.
"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one
wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before
taking the cauldron off the fire?"
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.
"Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus. Then he
rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.
"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought
he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another
point you've lost for Gryffindor."
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked
him behind their cauldron.
push it," he muttered, "I've heard Snape can turn very nasty."
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind
was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor
in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? "Cheer up,"
said Ron, "Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come
and meet Hagrid with you?"
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the
grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the
forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the
front door.
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and
several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang
-- back."
Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door
open.
"Hang on," he said. "Back, Fang."
He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous
black boarhound.
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from
the
ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner
stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.
"Make yerselves at home," said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded
straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was
clearly not as fierce as he looked.
"This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a
large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
"Another Weasley, eh?" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent
half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest."
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their
teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told
Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's
knee and drooled all over his robes.
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git."
"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang
sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me
everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it."
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not
to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.
"But he seemed to really hate me."
"Rubbish!" said Hagrid. "Why should he?"
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes
when he said that.
"How's yer brother Charlie?" Hagrid asked Ron. "I liked him a lot --
great with animals."
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron
told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a
piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a
cutting from the Daily Prophet:
GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST
Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July,
widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault
that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.
"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if
you know what's good for you," said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this
afternoon.
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to
rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.
"Hagrid!" said Harry, "that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
It might've been happening while we were there!"
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes
this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the
story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied
earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and
thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little
package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets
weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry
thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much
to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package
just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about
Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?
CHAPTER NINE
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than
Dudley,
but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year
Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to
put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a
notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all
groan.
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and
Slytherin would be learning together.
"Typical," said Harry darkly. "Just what I always wanted. To make a fool
of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy."
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself," said Ron
reasonably. "Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good
he
is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk."
Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about
first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long,
boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping
Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus
Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the
countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen
about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron
had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their
dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game
with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron
prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the
players move.
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his
grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had
good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of
accidents even with both feet on the ground.
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was.
This
was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she
hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with
flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through
the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for
anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but
everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted
by the arrival of the mail.
Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that
Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was
always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened
gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He
opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large
marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
"It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget things -- this
tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it
tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." His face fell, because the
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,
"You've forgotten something..."
Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy,
who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his
hand.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason
to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble
quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
"What's going on?"
"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor."
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.
"Just looking," he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind
him.
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors
hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying
lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their
feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn
on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees
were swaying darkly in the distance.
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying
in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley
complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to
vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and
yellow eyes like a hawk.
"Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand by a
broomstick. Come on, hurry up."
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck
out at odd angles.
"Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the
front, "and say 'Up!"'
"UPF everyone shouted.
Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few
that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and
Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell
when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's
voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the
ground.
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without
sliding
off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it
wrong for years.
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said
Madam Hooch. "Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come
straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three
-- two --"
But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the
ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's
lips.
"Come back, boy!" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a
cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his
scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,
slip sideways off the broom and --
WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass
in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and
started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.
"Broken wrist," Harry heard her mutter. "Come on, boy -- it's all right,
up you get.".
She turned to the rest of the class.
"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You
leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before
you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with
Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.
"Did you see his face, the great lump?"
The other Slytherins joined in.
"Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil.
"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced
Slytherin girl. "Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies,
Parvati."
"Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the
grass. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
"Give that here, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking
to watch.
Malfoy smiled nastily.
"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about --
up a tree?"
"Give it here!" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick
and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level
with the topmost branches of an oak he called, "Come and get it,
Potter!"
Harry grabbed his broom.
"No!" shouted Hermione Granger. "Madam Hooch told us not to move --
you'll get us all into trouble."
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom
and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed
through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of
fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being
taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up
a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls
back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked
stunned.
"Give it here," Harry called, "or I'll knock you off that broom!" "Oh,
yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the
broom
tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy
only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and
held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.
"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called.
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.
"Catch it if you can, then!" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball
high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and
then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down
-- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball
-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people
watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he
caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled
gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.
"HARRY POTTER!"
His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was
running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.
"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --"
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses
flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --"
"It wasn't his fault, Professor --"
"Be quiet, Miss Patil
"But Malfoy --"
"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now."
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he
left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward
the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to
say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong
with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even
looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't
even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What
would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor
McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and
marched
along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was
taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to
stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His
stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming
wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door
and poked her head inside.
"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?"
Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use
on
him?
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out
of Flitwicles class looking confused.
"Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on
up
the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
"In here."
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty
except
for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
"Out, Peeves!" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which
clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall
slammed
the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.
"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker."
Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
"Are you serious, Professor?"
"Absolutely," said Professor McGonagall crisply. "The boy's a natural.
I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a
broomstick, Potter?"
Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he
didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming
back to his legs.
"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor
McGonagall told Wood. "Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley
couldn't have done it."
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.
"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly.
"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall
explained.
"He's just the build for a Seeker, too," said Wood, now walking around
Harry and staring at him. "Light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a
decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep
Seven,
I'd say."
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the
first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape
in the face for weeks...."
Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.
"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind
about punishing you."
Then she suddenly smiled.
"Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent
Quidditch player himself."
"You're joking."
It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened
when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of
steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about
it.
"Seeker?" he said. "But first years never -- you must be the youngest
house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his
mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the
afternoon. "Wood told me."
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.
"I start training next week," said Harry. "Only don't tell anyone, Wood
wants to keep it a secret."
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and
hurried over.
"Well done," said George in a low voice. "Wood told us. We're on the
team too -- Beaters."
"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,"
said Fred. "We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is
going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping
when he told us."
"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret
passageway out of the school."
"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found
in our first week. See you."
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome
turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the
Muggles?"
"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got
your little friends with you," said Harry coolly. There was of course
nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was
full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their
knuckles and scowl.
"I'd take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. "Tonight, if you want.
Wizard's duel. Wands only -- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard
of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?"
"Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his second, who's
yours?"
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.
"Crabbe," he said. "Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy
room; that's always unlocked."
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. "What is a
wizard's duel?" said Harry. "And what do you mean, you're my second?"
"Well, a second's there to take over if you die," said Ron casually,
getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's
face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know,
with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send
sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real
damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway."
"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?"
"Throw it away and punch him on the nose," Ron suggested. "Excuse me."
They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.
"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?" said Ron.
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.
"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --"
"Bet you could," Ron muttered.
"--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the
points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be.
It's really very selfish of you."
"And it's really none of your business," said Harry.
"Good-bye," said Ron.
All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day,
Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus
falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had
spent all evening giving him advice such as "If he tries to curse you,
you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them."
There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or
Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another
school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming
up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy
face-to-face. He couldn't miss it.
"Half-past eleven," Ron muttered at last, "we'd better go."
They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across
the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor
common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning
all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached
the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, "I
can't believe you're going to do this, Harry."
A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe
and a frown.
"You!" said Ron furiously. "Go back to bed!"
"I almost told your brother," Hermione snapped, "Percy -- he's a
prefect, he'd put a stop to this."
Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.
"Come on," he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady
and climbed through the hole.
Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through
the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I
don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the
points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching
Spells."
"Go away." "All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said
when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so --"
But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the
portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an
empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione
was locked out of Gryffindor tower.
"Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly.
"That's your problem," said Ron. "We've got to go, we 3 re going to be
late."
They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught
up
with them.
"I'm coming with you," she said.
"You are not."
"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?
If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying
to stop you, and you can back me up."
"You've got some nerve --" said Ron loudly.
"Shut up, both of you!" said Harry sharply. I heard something."
It was a sort of snuffling.
"Mrs. Norris?" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.
It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor,
fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't
remember the new password to get in to bed."
"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't
help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere."
"How's your arm?" said Harry.
"Fine," said Neville, showing them. "Madam Pomfrey mended it in about
a
minute."
"Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you
later --"
"Don't leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I don't want to
stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already."
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and
Neville.
"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that
Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.
Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the
Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned
them all forward.
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the
high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.
Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor
and tiptoed toward the trophy room.
Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered
where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues
winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,
keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took
out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes
crept by.
"He's late, maybe he's chickened out," Ron whispered.
Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised
his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.
"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner."
It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly
at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried
silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had
barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy
room.
"They're in here somewhere," they heard him mutter, "probably hiding."
"This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to
creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch
getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke
into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of
them toppled right into a suit of armor.
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.
"RUN!" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not
looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the
doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead,
without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped
through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled
along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was
miles from the trophy room.
"I think we've lost him," Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall
and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and
spluttering.
I -- told -you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,
"I -- told -- you."
"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as
possible."
"Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry. "You realize that, don't
you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to
be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off."
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her
that.
"Let's go."
It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen
paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a
classroom in front of them.
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.
"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out."
Peeves cackled.
"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,
naughty, you'll get caughty."
"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please."
"Should tell Filch, I should," said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his
eyes glittered wickedly. "It's for your own good, you know."
"Get out of the way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a
big mistake.
"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF
BED DOWN THE
CHARMS CORRIDOR"
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the
corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.
"This is it!" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We're
done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as
fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts.
"Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped
the
lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!"
The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut
it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
"Which way did they go, Peeves?" Filch was saying. "Quick, tell me."
"Say 'please."'
"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?"
"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please," said Peeves in his
annoying singsong voice.
"All right -please."
"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say
please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing
away and Filch cursing in rage.
"He thinks this door is locked," Harry whispered. "I think we'll be okay
-- get off, Neville!" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of
Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. "What?"
Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he
was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of
everything that had happened so far.
They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The
forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was
forbidden.
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that
filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads.
Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching
and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging
in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry
knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their
sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting
over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take
Filch.
They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they
almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look
for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they
hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible
between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they
reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.
"Where on earth have you all been?" she asked, looking at their
bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," panted Harry, and the
portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and
collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.
It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked
as if he'd never speak again.
"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up
in a school?" said Ron finally. "If any dog needs exercise, that one
does."
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. "You
don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't you see
what it was standing on.
"The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too
busy with its heads."
"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously
guarding something."
She stood up, glaring at them.
I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed --
or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed."
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
"No, we don't mind," he said. "You'd think we dragged her along,
wouldn't you.
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he
climbed
back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said?
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to
hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package
from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
CHAPTER TEN
HALLOWEEN
Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the
three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite
keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the
package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and
they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy
protection. "It's either really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron.
"Or both," said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it
was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what
it was without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never
going near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such
a
bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really
wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great
delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention
was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech
owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in
this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and
dropped
it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had
hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top
of the parcel.
Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:
DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody
knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood
will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your
first training session.
Professor McGonagall
Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to
read.
"A Nimbus Two Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I've never even
touched
one."
They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private
before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they
found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the
package from Harry and felt it.
"That's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture
of jealousy and spite on his face. "You'll be in for it this time,
Potter, first years aren't allowed them."
Ron couldn't resist it.
"It's not any old broomstick," he said, "it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.
What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron
grinned at Harry. "Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same
league as the Nimbus."
"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the
handle," Malfoy snapped back. "I suppose you and your brothers have to
save up twig by twig."
Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.
"Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked.
"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly.
"Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,
Potter. And what model is it?"
"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the
look of horror on Malfoy's face. "And it's really thanks to Malfoy here
that I've got it," he added.
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's
obvious rage and confusion. "Well, it's true," Harry chortled as they
reached the top of the marble staircase, "If he hadn't stolen Neville's
Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...."
"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?" came an
angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,
looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.
"I thought you weren't speaking to us?" said Harry.
"Yes, don't stop now," said Ron, "it's doing us so much good."
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It
kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying
under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be
learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without
noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap
the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
"Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it
looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long
tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold
near the top.
As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the
dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium
before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that
the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end
of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They
reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle
children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick
and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out
of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two
Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
"Hey, Potter, come down!'
Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his
arm. Harry landed next to him.
"Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting. "I see what McGonagall
meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules
this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week."
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
"Right," said Wood. "Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even
if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.
Three of them are called Chasers."
"Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball
about the size of a soccer ball.
"This ball's called the Quaffle," said Wood. "The Chasers throw the
Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to
score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the
hoops. Follow me?"
"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,"
Harry recited. "So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with
six hoops, isn't it?"
"What's basketball?" said Wood curiously. "Never mind," said Harry
quickly.
"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm
Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other
team from scoring."
"Three Chasers, one Keeper," said Harry, who was determined to
remember
it all. "And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are
they for?" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.
"I'll show you now," said Wood. "Take this."
He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do," Wood said. "These two are
the Bludgers."
He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than
the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to
escape the straps holding them inside the box.
"Stand back," Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the
Bludgers.
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at
Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking
his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around
their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to
pin it to the ground.
"See?" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate
and strapping it down safely. "The Bludgers rocket around, trying to
knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each
team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their
side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So
-- think you've got all that?"
"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the
goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry
reeled off.
"Very good," said Wood.
"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry asked, hoping he
sounded offhand.
"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse
than that. Now, the last member of the team is the
Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the
Bludgers unless they crack my head open."
"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I
mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves."
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size
of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver
wings.
"This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important
ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and
difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave
in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it
before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the
Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they
nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of
Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages
-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on
substitutes so the players could get some sleep. "Well, that's it -- any
questions?"
Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was
doing it that was going to be the problem.
"We won't practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting
it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try
you out with a few of these."
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few
minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf
balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.
Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an
hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.
"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily
as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you
turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for
England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons."
Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice
three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly
believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two
months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His
lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had
mastered the basics.
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking
pumpkin
wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced
in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,
something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make
Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the
class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which
was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron,
however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell
whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to
either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.
"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"
squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as
usual. "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic
words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio,
who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a
buffalo on his chest."
It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the
feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the
desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and
set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.
Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.
"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.
"You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gardium
Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long."
"You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled.
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,
"Wingardium Leviosa!"
Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their
heads.
"Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone see here,
Miss Granger's done it!"
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. "It's no wonder no
one can stand her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the
crowded corridor, "she's a nightmare, honestly. "
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.
Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she
was in tears.
"I think she heard you."
"So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed
she's got no friends."
Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all
afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,
Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that
Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had
entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione
out
of their minds.
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a
thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the
candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the
golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell
came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.
Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped
against the table, and gasped, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you
ought to know."
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from
the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.
"Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories
immediately!"
Percy was in his element.
"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if
you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years
coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!"
"How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.
"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid," said Ron. "Maybe
Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke."
They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry
suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.
"I've just thought -- Hermione."
"What about her?"
"She doesn't know about the troll."
Ron bit his lip.
"Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us."
Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped
down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls'
bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick
footsteps behind them.
"Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the
corridor and disappeared from view.
"What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons
with the rest of the teachers?"
"Search me."
Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's
fading footsteps.
"He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his
hand.
"Can you smell something?"
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old
socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of
gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left,
something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows
and
watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite
gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head
perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks
with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was
holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its
arms were so long.
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its
long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.
"The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in."
"Good idea," said Ron nervously.
They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't
about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the
key, slam the door, and lock it.
'Yes!"
Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but
as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts
stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber
they'd just chained up.
"Oh, no," said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.
"It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry gasped.
"Hermione!" they said together.
It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?
Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key,
fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if
she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the
sinks off the walls as it went.
"Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he
threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking
stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw
Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it
went.
"Oy, pea-brain!" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he
threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe
hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning
its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.
"Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward
the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall,
her mouth open with terror.
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It
roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to
escape.
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He
took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the
troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there,
but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its
nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it
had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.
Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry
clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him
off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand --
not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell
that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!"
The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into
the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto
its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its
face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was
standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.
It was Hermione who spoke first.
"Is it -- dead?"
I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out."
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered
in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
"Urgh -- troll boogers."
He wiped it on the troll's trousers.
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.
They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,
someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A
moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room,
closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell
took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly
down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and
Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's
mind.
"What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with
cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with
his wand in the air. "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in
your dormitory?"
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He
wished Ron would put his wand down.
Then a small voice came out of the shadows.
"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me."
"Miss Granger!"
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.
I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it
on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them."
Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a
teacher? "If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand
up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have
time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they
arrived."
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.
"Well -- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the
three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of
tackling a mountain troll on your own?"
Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last
person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending
she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started
handing out sweets.
"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this," said
Professor McGonagall. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt
at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing
the feast in their houses."
Hermione left.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have
taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five
points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go."
They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had
climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the
troll, quite apart from anything else.
"We should have gotten more than ten points," Ron grumbled.
"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's."
"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that," Ron admitted. "Mind
you, we did save her."
"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with
her," Harry reminded him.
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
"Pig snout," they said and entered.
The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food
that
had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting
for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them
looking
at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates.
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There
are
some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and
knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
QUIDDITCH
As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains
around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every
morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the
upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled
up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous
beaverskin boots.
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in
his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If
Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house
championship.
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as
their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news
that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't
know
which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people
telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't
know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what
with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do.
She
had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a
very interesting read.
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a
Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup
match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest
players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to
them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had
been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry
and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer
for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them
were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured
them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape
crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;
they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about
their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen
the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off
anyway.
"What's that you've got there, Potter?"
It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.
"Library books are not to be taken outside the school," said Snape.
"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor."
"He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped
away. "Wonder what's wrong with his leg?"
"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him," said Ron bitterly.
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron,
and
Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry
and
Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy ("How
will
you learn?"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right
answers anyway.
Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take
his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of
Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape
if
he could have it.
"Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that
Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no
answer.
He knocked again. Nothing.
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed
the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes.
Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above
his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing
Snape bandages.
"Blasted Snape was saying. "How are you supposed to keep your
eyes on all three heads at once?"
Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but --
"POTTER!"
Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to
hide his leg. Harry gulped.
"I just wondered if I could have my book back."
"GET OUT! OUT!"
Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He
sprinted back upstairs.
"Did you get it?" Ron asked as Harry joined them. "What's the matter?"
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.
"You know what this means?" he finished breathlessly. "He tried to get
past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when
we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding! And Id bet my
broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!"
Hermione's eyes were wide.
"No -- he wouldn't, she said. "I know he's not very nice, but he
wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe."
"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,"
snapped Ron. "I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But
what's he after? What's that dog guarding?"
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville
was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind
-- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a
few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his
leg wasn't easy to forget.
The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of
the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of
everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
"You've got to eat some breakfast."
"I don't want anything."
"Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione.
"I'm not hungry."
Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.
"Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. "Seekers are
always the ones who get clobbered by the other team."
"Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his
sausages.
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around
the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be
raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going
on sometimes.
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan
up in
the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on
one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and
Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion
underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that
the paint flashed different colors.
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were
changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing
in green).
Wood cleared his throat for silence.
"Okay, men," he said.
"And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson.
"And women," Wood agreed. "This is it."
"The big one," said Fred Weasley.
"The one we've all been waiting for," said George.
"We know Oliver's speech by heart," Fred told Harry, "we were on the
team last year."
"Shut up, you two," said Wood. "This is the best team Gryffindor's had
in years. We're going to win. I know it."
He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else."
"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you."
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his
knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting
for the two teams, her broom in her hand.
"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all
gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking
particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry
thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the
corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing
Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.
"Mount your brooms, please."
Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.
Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. "And the
Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what
an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --"
"JORDAN!"
"Sorry, Professor."
The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the
match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet,
a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to
Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin
Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying
like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent
move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle --
that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint,
off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of
the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's
Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a
second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell
which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in
possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's
really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead
-- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses --
GRYFFINDORS SCORE!"
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the
Slytherins.
"Budge up there, move along."
"Hagrid!"
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join
them.
"Bin watchin' from me hut," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of
binoculars around his neck, "But it isn't the same as bein' in the
crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?"
"Nope," said Ron. "Harry hasn't had much to do yet."
"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his
binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for
some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan.
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had
said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be."
When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to
let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.
Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection
from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to
come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry
dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
"All right there, Harry?" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger
furiously toward Marcus Flint.
"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks
two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the --
wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?"
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle,
too
busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his
left ear.
Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the
streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck
and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have
forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to
watch.
Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings
fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus
Flint
had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry
holding on for dear life.
"Foul!" screamed the Gryffindors.
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the
goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the
Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red
card!"
"What are you talking about, Dean?" said Ron.
"Red card!" said Dean furiously. "In soccer you get shown the red card
and you're out of the game!"
"But this isn't soccer, Dean," Ron reminded him.
Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.
"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the
air."
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating
"Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall.
"I mean, after that open and revolting foul
'Jordan, I'm warning you --"
"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which
could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by
Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor
still in possession."
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously
past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening
lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped
the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt
anything like that.
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him
off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their
riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts
-- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he
realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't
turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the
air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that
almost unseated him.
Lee was still commentating.
"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet --
passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose
-- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's
broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away
from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared
through
his binoculars. "If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of
his broom... but he can't have...."
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His
broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to
hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild
jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on
with only one hand.
"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?" Seamus whispered.
"Can't have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere
with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to
a Nimbus Two Thousand."
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of
looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.
"What are you doing?" moaned Ron, gray-faced.
"I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape -- look."
Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands
opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop
under his breath.
"He's doing something -- jinxing the broom," said Hermione.
"What should we do?"
"Leave it to me."
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron
turned
the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was
almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was
on
its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull
Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time
they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower
and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.
Marcus
Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
"Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered desperately.
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and
was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say
sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered
a
few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the
hem of Snape's robes.
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.
A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him
into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row --
Snape would never know what had happened.
It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on
to his broom.
"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into
Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his
hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field
on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.
"I've got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the
game ended in complete confusion.
"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling
twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken
any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results --
Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry
heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back
in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.
"It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was
cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."
"Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on
next
to him in the stands. "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell
him. Harry decided on the truth.
"I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. "He tried to get past
that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying
to steal whatever it's guarding."
Hagrid dropped the teapot.
"How do you know about Fluffy?" he said.
"Fluffy?"
"Yeah -- he's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub
las' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the
"Yes?" said Harry eagerly.
"Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret,
that is."
"But Snape's trying to steal it."
"Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do
nothin' of the sort."
"So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione.
The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about
Snape.
I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!
You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw
him!"
"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly. "I don' know why
Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student!
Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don'
concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what
it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel
--"
"Aha!" said Harry, "so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved,
is there?"
Hagrid looked furious with himself.
CHAPTER TWELVE
THE MIRROR OF ERISED
Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke
to find
itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the
Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that
they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The
few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to
deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could
fly off again.
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common
room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had
become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.
Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where
their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as
possible to their hot cauldrons.
"I do feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, "for all
those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're
not wanted at home."
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.
Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them.
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch
match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get
everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing
Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny,
because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay
on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back
to taunting Harry about having no proper family.
It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of
students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up
at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be
the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying,
too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit
Charlie.
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large
fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at
the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.
"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?" Ron asked, sticking his head through the
branches.
"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron."
"Would you mind moving out of the way?" came Malfoys cold drawl from
behind them. "Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping
to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut
of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used
to."
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
"WEASLEY!"
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes.
"He was provoked, Professor Snape," said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy
face out from behind the tree. "Malfoy was insultin' his family."
"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said
Snape silkily. "Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it
isn't more. Move along, all of you."
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering
needles everywhere and smirking.
"I'll get him," said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, "one of
these days, I'll get him --"
"I hate them both," said Harry, "Malfoy and Snape."
"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas," said Hagrid. "Tell yeh what,
come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat."
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great
Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with
the Christmas decorations.
"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?"
The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all
around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood
around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with
hundreds of candles.
"How many days you got left until yer holidays?" Hagrid asked.
"Just one," said Hermione. "And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got
half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."
"Oh yeah, you're right," said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor
Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was
trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
"The library?" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. "Just before
the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?"
"Oh, we're not working," Harry told him brightly. "Ever since you
mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is."
"You what?" Hagrid looked shocked. "Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop
it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'."
"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all," said Hermione.
"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?" Harry added. "We
must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him
anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere."
"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.
"Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said Ron, and they left
Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since
Hagrid
had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape
was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to
begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a
book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable
Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important
Modern
Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.
And
then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of
thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to
search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them
off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted
Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere
in
there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the
teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never
get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never
taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced
Defense Against the Dark Arts.
"What are you looking for, boy?"
"Nothing," said Harry.
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.
"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!"
Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left
the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not
ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be
able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were
up to.
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found
anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two
weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it
wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a
nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.
They went off to lunch.
"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. "And
send me an owl if you find anything."
"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron.
"It'd be safe to ask them."
"Very safe, as they're both dentists," said Hermione.
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time
to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the
common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the
good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they
could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows
-- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk
about even if they wouldn't work.
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like
Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot
like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.
Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in
his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen
weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble
getting them to do what he wanted.
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they
didn't
trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept
shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. "Don't
send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose
him." On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next
day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.
When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a
small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.
"Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and
pulled on his bathrobe.
"You, too," said Harry. "Will you look at this? I've got some presents!"
"What did you expect, turnips?" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which
was a lot bigger than Harry's.
Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and
scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut
wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it --
it sounded a bit like an owl.
A second, very small parcel contained a note.
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From
Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.
"That's friendly," said Harry.
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.
"Weird!" he said, 'NMat a shape! This is money?"
"You can keep it," said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. "Hagrid
and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?"
"I think I know who that one's from," said Ron, turning a bit pink and
pointing to a very lumpy parcel. "My mom. I told her you didn't expect
any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasley
sweater."
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in
emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
"Every year she makes us a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and
mine's always maroon."
"That's really nice of her," said Harry, trying the fudge, which was
very tasty.
His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs
from Hermione.
This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very
light. He unwrapped it.
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it
lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.
"I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of
Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. "If that's what I think it
is -- they're really rare, and really valuable."
"What is it?"
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to
the touch, like water woven into material.
"It's an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. "I'm
sure it is -- try it on."
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.
"It is! Look down!"
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the
mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head
suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak
over his head and his reflection vanished completely.
"There's a note!" said Ron suddenly. "A note fell out of it!"
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,
loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your
father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was
returned to you. Use it well.
A Very Merry Christmas to you.
There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the
cloak.
"I'd give anything for one of these," he said. "Anything. What's the
matter?"
"Nothing," said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had
it really once belonged to his father?
Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung
open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak
quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else
yet.
"Merry Christmas!"
"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!"
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on
it, the other a G.
"Harry's is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up Harry's
sweater. "She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."
"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, get
it
on, they're lovely and warm."
"I hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.
"You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose she
thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're
called Gred and Forge."
"What's all th is noise.
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He
had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too,
carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which
Fred seized.
"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even
Harry got one."
"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater
over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said
George. "Christmas is a time for family."
They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by
his sweater.
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred
fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of
chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy
and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet
along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the
feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little
plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard
cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like
a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the
inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at
the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a
flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick
had just read him.
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his
teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid
getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,
finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's
amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of
things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous
balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were
going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious
snowball
fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they
returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in
his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he
wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,
everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and
watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because
they'd stolen his prefect badge.
It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been
nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed
was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had
sent it.
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,
fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his
four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the
cloak out from under it.
His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow
over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note
had said.
He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak
around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and
shadows. It was a very funny feeling.
Use it well.
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to
him
in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the
dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch
would never know.
Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him
back
-- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he
wanted to use it alone.
He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,
and climbed through the portrait hole.
"Who's there?" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked
quickly down the corridor.
Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then
it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to
read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.
He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he
walked.
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his
way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along
in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the
sight gave him the creeps.
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping
carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the
library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.
They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled
words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The
hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,
maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books,
as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.
He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,
he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large
black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with
difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,
let it fall open.
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was
screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one
high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked
over
his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming
down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the
shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild
eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's
outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks
still ringing in his ears.
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been
so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where
he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he
was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he
must be five floors above there.
"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was
wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted
Section."
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must
know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and
to his horror, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well,
they can't be far, we'll catch them."
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner
ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor
and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak
didn't stop him from being solid.
He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It
was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying
not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room
without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry
leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps
dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before
he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs
were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper
basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that
didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone
had just put it there to keep it out of the way.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved
around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic
fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved
nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection
again. He stepped in front of it.
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He
whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the
book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but
a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to
the mirror.
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,
reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his
shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,
too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's
trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his
reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt
the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their
reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the
others existed only in the mirror.
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her
eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the
glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that
she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,
black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore
glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as
Harry's did.
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching
that of his reflection.
"Mom?" he whispered. "Dad?"
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the
faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green
eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as
though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family,
for the first time in his life.
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at
them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping
to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache
inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade
and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his
senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He
tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, "I'll come back,"
and hurried from the room.
"You could have woken me up," said Ron, crossly.
"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.
"I'd like to see your mom and dad," Ron said eagerly.
"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to
show me your other brothers and everyone."
"You can see them any old time," said Ron. "Just come round my house
this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not
finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you
eating anything?"
Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them
again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very
important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?
What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?
"Are you all right?" said Ron. "You look odd."
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror
room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much
more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the
library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
"I'm freezing," said Ron. "Let's forget it and go back."
"No!" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere."
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction,
but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead
with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
"It's here -- just here -- yes!"
They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his
shoulders and ran to the mirror.
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.
"See?" Harry whispered.
"I can't see anything."
"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...."
"I can only see you."
"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am."
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't
see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.
"Look at me!" he said.
"Can you see all your family standing around you?"
"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head
boy!"
"What?"
"I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the
house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too.
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at
Harry.
"Do you think this mirror shows the future?"
"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --"
"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time."
"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I
want to see my parents."
"Don't push me --"
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.
They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.
"Quick!"
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris
came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the
same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she
turned and left.
"This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.
Come on."
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.
"Want to play chess, Harry?" said Ron.
"No."
"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?"
"No... you go..."
"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back
tonight."
"Why not?"
"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had
too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are
wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into
you? What if you knock something over?"
"You sound like Hermione."
"I'm serious, Harry, don't go."
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in
front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was
walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he
didn't meet anyone.
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of
his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in
front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all
night with his family. Nothing at all.
Except --
"So -- back again, Harry?"
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind
him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to
get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.
" -- I didn't see you, sir."
"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you," said
Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
"So," said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with
Harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of
the Mirror of Erised."
"I didn't know it was called that, Sir."
"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?"
"It -- well -- it shows me my family --"
"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy."
"How did you know --?"
"I don't need a cloak to become invisible," said Dumbledore gently.
"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?"
Harry shook his head.
"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it
and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?"
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we want...
whatever we want..."
"Yes and no," said Dumbledore quietly. "It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have
never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley,
who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing
alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us
neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by
what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is
real or even possible.
"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will
now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,
remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and
get off to bed?"
Harry stood up.
"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?"
"Obviously, you've just done so," Dumbledore smiled. "You may ask me
one
more thing, however."
"What do you see when you look in the mirror?"
"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."
Harry stared.
"One can never have enough socks," said Dumbledore. "Another
Christmas
has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on
giving me books."
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore
might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved
Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
NICOLAS FLAMEL
Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of
Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the
invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry
wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he
couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed
about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high
voice cackled with laughter.
"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said
Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.
Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different
view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being
out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("If Filch had
caught you!"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who
Nicolas Flamel was.
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary
book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.
Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten
minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other
two, because Quidditch practice had started again.
Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that
had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys
complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's
side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would
overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven
years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer
nightmares when he was tired out after training.
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave
the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the
Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off
their brooms.
"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. "That's exactly the sort of
thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll
be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
"Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's
he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we
might overtake Slytherin."
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
"It's not my fault," said Wood. "We've just got to make sure we play a
clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us."
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for
not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the
end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common
room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the
only
thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very
good for her.
"Don't talk to me for a moment," said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, "I need to concen --" He caught sight of Harry's face. "What's the
matter with you? You look terrible."
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other
two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
"Don't play," said Hermione at once.
"Say you're ill," said Ron.
"Pretend to break your leg," Hermione suggested.
"Really break your leg," said Ron.
"I can't," said Harry. "There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out,
Gryffindor can't play at all."
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had
managed
to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs
had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the
Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to
Gryffindor tower.
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and
performed
the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,
trembling. "What happened?" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit
with Harry and Ron.
"Malfoy," said Neville shakily. "I met him outside the library. He said
he'd been looking for someone to practice that on."
"Go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermione urged Neville. "Report him!"
Neville shook his head.
"I don't want more trouble," he mumbled.
"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!" said Ron. "He's used to
walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of
him and make it easier."
"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,
Malfoy's already done that," Neville choked out.
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog,
the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He
gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.
"You're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said. "The Sorting Hat chose you
for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin."
Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.
"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card, you
collect them, don't you?"
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.
"Dumbledore again," he said, "He was the first one I ever-"
He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron
and Hermione.
"I've found him!" he whispered. "I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read
the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen
to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark
wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of
dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
Flamel'!"
Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd
gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.
"Stay there!" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls'
dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks
before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.
"I never thought to look in here!" she whispered excitedly. "I got this
out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"Light?" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked
something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages,
muttering to herself.
At last she found what she was looking for.
"I knew it! I knew it!"
"Are we allowed to speak yet?" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored
him.
"Nicolas Flamel," she whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker
of the Sorcerer's Stone!"
This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.
"The what?" said Harry and Ron.
"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there."
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient
study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a
legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform
any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which
will make the drinker immortal.
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries,
but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel,
the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six
hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon
with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
"See?" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. "The dog must
be
guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it
safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it,
that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"
"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!" said Harry. "No
wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it."
"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent
Developments in Wizardry," said Ron. "He's not exactly recent if he's
six hundred and sixty-five, is he?"
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down
different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still
discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It
wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry
remembered about Snape and the coming match.
"I'm going to play," he told Ron and Hermione. "If I don't, all the
Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show
them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win."
"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said Hermione.
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more
nervous,
whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm,
either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was
wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed
to, with such a biased referee?
Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to
keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered
whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions
lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so
horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the
Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had
the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms
the
next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd
ever
see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry
hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch
robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to
Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or
why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry
know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker
Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were
ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," Hermione muttered as Ron
slipped his wand up his sleeve.
"I know," Ron snapped. "Don't nag."
Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.
"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early
capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor
Hufflepuff too much."
"The whole school's out there!" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the
door. "Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!"
Harry's heart did a somersault.
"Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.
There was no mistaking that silver beard.
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was
simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore
was
watching.
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched
onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.
"I've never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione. "Look -they're
off Ouch!"
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.
"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there."
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone
want a bet? What about you, Weasley?"
Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because
George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her
fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was
circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said
Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another
penalty for no reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See,
there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've
got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no
brains."
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.
"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not
daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville."
"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and
that's saying something."
Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety
about Harry.
"I'm warning you, Malfoy -- one more word
"Ron!" said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --"
"What? Where?"
Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and
cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her
mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the
ground!" said Malfoy.
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top
of
him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over
the back of his seat to help.
"Come on, Harry!" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as
Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron
rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the
whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see
something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next
second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the
Snitch clasped in his hand.
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember
the Snitch being caught so quickly.
"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won!
Gryffindor is in the lead!" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on
her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.
Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe
it. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five
minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land
nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his
shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.
"Well done," said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.
"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping
busy... excellent..."
Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two
Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling
happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could
say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never
smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour
in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him
onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and
down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and
looked
up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.
Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....
And speaking of Snape...
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly
not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the
forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He
recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest
while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding
silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He
followed.
The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in
circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he
heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering
beech tree.
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his
broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy
clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too.
Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering
worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.
"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,
Severus..."
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private," said Snape, his voice icy.
"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after
all."
Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape
interrupted
him.
"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?"
"B-b-but Severus, I --"
"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," said Snape, taking a step
toward him.
"I-I don't know what you
"You know perfectly well what I mean."
An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied
himself in time to hear Snape say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.
I'm waiting."
"B-but I d-d-don't --"
"Very well," Snape cut in. "We'll have another little chat soon, when
you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties
lie."
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was
almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as
though he was petrified.
"Harry, where have you been?" Hermione squeaked.
"We won! You won! We won!" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the
back. "And
I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle
single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all
right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the
common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes
and
stuff from the kitchens."
"Never mind that now," said Harry breathlessly. "Let's find an empty
room, you wait 'til you hear this...."
He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them,
then he told them what he'd seen and heard.
"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to
force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past
Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon
there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of
enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark
Arts
spell that Snape needs to break through --"
"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to
Snape?" said Hermione in alarm.
"It'll be gone by next Tuesday," said Ron.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the
weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it
didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was
still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper,
which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed
Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron
had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.
Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She
had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.
Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the
same.
"Hermione, the exams are ages away."
"Ten weeks," Hermione snapped. "That's not ages, that's like a second to
Nicolas Flamel."
"But we're not six hundred years old," Ron reminded her. "Anyway, what
are you studying for, you already know it A."
"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass
these exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I
should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten
into me...."
Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines
as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter
holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard
to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's
blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and
Ron
spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get
through all their extra work.
"I'll never remember this," Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down
his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the
first really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear,
forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.
Harry, who was looking up "Dittany" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and
Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, "Hagrid! What are you
doing in the library?"
Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked
very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.
"Jus' lookin'," he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at
once. "An' what're you lot up ter?" He looked suddenly suspicious. "Yer
not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?" "Oh, we found out who he
is ages ago," said Ron impressively. "And we know what that dog's
guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St --"
"Shhhh!" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?"
"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact," said
Harry, "about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --"
"SHHHH!" said Hagrid again. "Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not
promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it
in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh
--"
"See you later, then," said Harry.
Hagrid shuffled off.
"What was he hiding behind his back?" said Hermione thoughtfully.
"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?"
"I'm going to see what section he was in," said Ron, who'd had enough of
working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms
and slammed them down on the table.
"Dragons!" he whispered. "Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!
Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to
Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide."
"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever
met him, " said Harry.
"But it's against our laws," said Ron. "Dragon breeding was outlawed by
the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop
Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden -
anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns
Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania."
"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?" said Harry.
"Of course there are," said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebridean
Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.
Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to
make them forget."
"So what on earths Hagrid up to?" said Hermione.
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later,
they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid
called "Who is it?" before he let them in, and then shut the door
quickly behind them.
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there
was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them
stoat sandwiches, which they refused.
"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?"
"Yes," said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. "We were
wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone
apart from Fluffy."
Hagrid frowned at him.
"0' course I cant, he said. "Number one, I don' know meself. Number two,
yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That
Stone's here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I
s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou'
Fluffy."
"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,
you know everything that goes on round here," said Hermione in a warm,
flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was
smiling. "We only wondered who had done the guarding, really."
Hermione
went on. "We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,
apart from you."
Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at
Hermione.
"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he
borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments...
Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --" he
ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore
himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh
yeah, Professor Snape."
"Snape?"
"Yeah -- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped
protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it."
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If
Snape
had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out
how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything --
except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.
"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you,
Hagrid?" said Harry anxiously. "And you wouldn't tell anyone, would
you?
Not even one of the teachers?"
"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore," said Hagrid proudly.
"Well, that's something," Harry muttered to the others. "Hagrid, can we
have a window open? I'm boiling."
"Can't, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the
fire. Harry looked at it, too.
"Hagrid -- what's that?"
But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,
underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.
"Ah," said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, "That's er..."
"Where did you get it, Hagrid?" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get
a closer look at the egg. "It must've cost you a fortune."
"Won it," said Hagrid. "Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a
few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was
quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest."
"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?" said Hermione.
"Well, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book
from under his pillow. "Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding
for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's
all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I
em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with
chicken blood every half hour. An' see here -- how ter recognize
diff'rent eggs -- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback. They're
rare, them."
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.
"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house," she said.
But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the
fire.
So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to
Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.
"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life," Ron sighed, as evening
after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were
getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and
Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from
Hagrid.
He had written only two words: It's hatching.
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione
wouldn't hear of it.
"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon
hatching?"
"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what
Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing --"
"Shut up!" Harry whispered.
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How
much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,
Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during
morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their
lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried
through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them,
looking flushed and excited.
"It's nearly out." He ushered them inside.
The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something
was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated
breath.
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby
dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought
it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge
compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils,
the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.
It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.
"Isn't he beautiful?" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke
the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.
"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!" said Hagrid.
"Hagrid," said Hermione, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,
exactly?"
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face
-- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.
"What's the matter?"
"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid --
he's runnin' back up ter the school."
Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no
mistaking him.
Malfoy had seen the dragon.
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week
made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their
free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.
"Just let him go," Harry urged. "Set him free."
"I can't," said Hagrid. "He's too little. He'd die."
They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a
week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing
his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy.
There
were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.
"I've decided to call him Norbert," said Hagrid, looking at the dragon
with misty eyes. "He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert!
Where's Mommy?"
"He's lost his marbles," Ron muttered in Harry's ear.
"Hagrid," said Harry loudly, "give it two weeks and Norbert's going to
be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any
moment."
Hagrid bit his lip.
"I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I
can't."
Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.
"You're losing it, too," said Ron. "I'm Ron, remember?"
"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.
We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put
him back in the wild!"
"Brilliant!" said Ron. "How about it, Hagrid?"
And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to
ask him.
The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and
Harry
sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to
bed. The clock on the wall had just
chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of
nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at
Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by
the crate.
"It bit me!" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a
bloody handkerchief. "I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a
week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met,
but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little
bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when
I left, he was singing it a lullaby."
There was a tap on the dark window.
"It's Hedwig!" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. "She'll have
Charlie's answer!"
The three of them put their heads together to read the note.
Dear Ron,
How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian
Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing
will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to
visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal
dragon.
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on
Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still
dark.
Send me an answer as soon as possible.
Love,
Charlie
They looked at one another.
"We've got the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It shouldn't be too
difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and
Norbert."
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two
agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.
There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to
twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam
Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though,
he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked
as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day
to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
"It's not just my hand," he whispered, "although that feels like it's
about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of
my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept
threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a
dog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the
Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this."
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said Hermione, but this
didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke
into a sweat.
"Midnight on Saturday!" he said in a hoarse voice. "Oh no oh no -- I've
just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's
going to know we're getting rid of Norbert."
Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came
over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
"It's too late to change the plan now," Harry told Hermione. "We haven't
got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance
to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the
invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that."
They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail
when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.
"I won't let you in," he puffed. "Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin'
I can't handle."
When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears,
although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the
leg.
"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only
a baby, after all."
The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry
and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come
quickly enough.
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say
good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had
to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late
arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get
out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis
against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey," said Hagrid in
a muffled voice. "An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets
lonely."
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as
though the teddy was having his head torn off.
"Bye-bye, Norbert!" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the
crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.
"Mommy will never forget you!"
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never
knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble
staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another
staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the
work much easier.
"Nearly there!" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the
tallest tower.
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.
Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the
shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each
other ten feet away. A lamp flared.
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by
the ear.
"Detention!" she shouted. "And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering
around in the middle of the night, how dare you --"
"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a
dragon!"
"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see
Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!"
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest
thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the
cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe
properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.
"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!"
"Don't," Harry advised her.
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his
crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out
of the darkness.
Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the
harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and
Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.
At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.
They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as
their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in
detention -- what could spoil their happiness?
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they
stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the
darkness.
"Well, well, well," he whispered, "we are in trouble."
They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
THE FORIBIDDEN FOREST
Things couldn't have been worse.
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor,
where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione
was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each
other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't
see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were
cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?
There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for
their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of
night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was
out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility
cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.
Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong.
When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.
"Harry!" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. "I was
trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to
catch you, he said you had a drag --"
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor
McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert
as she towered over the three of them.
"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were
up in the astronomy tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain
yourselves."
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's
question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.
"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on," said Professor
McGonagall. "It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco
Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of
bed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's
funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?"
Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this
wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor,
blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and
find them in the dark, to warn them.
"I'm disgusted," said Professor McGonagall. "Four students out of bed in
one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I
thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor
meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions --
yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around
school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty
points will be taken from Gryffindor."
"Fifty?" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in
the last Quidditch match.
"Fifty points each," said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily
through her long, pointed nose.
"Professor -- please
"You can't --"
"Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all
of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students."
A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In
one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house
cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How
could they ever make up for this?
Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his
pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to
say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the
dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what
they'd done?
At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the
house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they
suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then
the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter,
their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points,
him and a couple of other stupid first years.
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,
Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs
turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose
the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble
to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other
hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, "Thanks
Potter, we owe you one!"
Only Ron stood by him.
"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads
of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like
them."
"They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have
they?" said Harry miserably.
"Well -- no," Ron admitted.
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not
to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it
with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he
went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
"Resign?" Wood thundered. "What good'll that do? How are we going to
get
any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?"
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak
to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they
called him "the Seeker."
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time
as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to
them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in
class, keeping her head down and working in silence.
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying
he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to
themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the
ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart,
memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new
resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put
to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one
afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As
he
drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice.
"No -- no -- not again, please --"
It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.
"All right -- all right --" he heard Quirrell sob.
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening
his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He
strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him.
He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into
the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.
Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised
himself about not meddling.
All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had
just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be
walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given
in at last.
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on
Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.
"Snape's done it, then!" said Ron. "If Quirrell's told him how to break
his Anti-Dark Force spell --"
"There's still Fluffy, though," said Hermione.
"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,"
said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. "I bet
there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant
three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?"
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione
answered before Harry could.
"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try
anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure."
"But we've got no proof!" said Harry. "Quirrell's too scared to back us
up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at
Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you
think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him,
Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help
us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the
more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget,
we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot
of explaining."
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.
"If we just do a bit of poking around --"
"No," said Harry flatly, "we've done enough poking around."
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of
its moons.
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and
Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:
Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch
in the entrance hall.
Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do
in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to
complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't
say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.
At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common
room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already
there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had
gotten a detention, too.
"Follow me," said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.
I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you,
eh?" he said, leering at them. "Oh yes... hard work and pain are the
best teachers if you ask me.... It's just a pity they let the old
punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a
few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in
case they're ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don't think of
running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do."
They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry
wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something
really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.
The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them
into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's
hut. Then they heard a distant shout.
"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started."
Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it
wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because
Filch said, "I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that
oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and I'm
much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece."
At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his
tracks.
"The forest?" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual.
"We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there
-- werewolves, I heard."
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.
"That's your problem, isn't it?" said Filch, his voice cracking with
glee. "Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble,
shouldn't you?"
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He
was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his
shoulder.
"Abou' time," he said. "I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All
right, Harry, Hermione?"
"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid," said Filch coldly,
they're here to be punished, after all."
"That's why yer late, is it?" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. "Bin
lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit,
I'll take over from here."
"I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them," he added
nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp
bobbing away in the darkness.
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.
"I'm not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear
the note of panic in his voice.
"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts," said Hagrid fiercely.
"Yeh've done wrong an' now yehve got ter pay fer it."
"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd
be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd
tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. "Copyin' lines!
What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or Yeh'll get out.
If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off
ter the castle an' pack. Go on"'
Malfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his
gaze.
"Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous
what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow
me over here a moment."
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he
pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the
thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into
the forest.
"Look there," said Hagrid, "see that stuff shinin' on the ground?
Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt
badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead
last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have
ter put it out of its misery."
"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?" said Malfoy,
unable to keep the fear out of his voice.
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with
me or Fang," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're
gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent
directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin'
around since last night at least."
"I want Fang," said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth.
"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward," said Hagrid. " So me, Harry,
an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other.
Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right?
Get yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in
trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be
careful -- let's go."
The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a
fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left
path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a
ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue
blood on the fallen leaves.
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?" Harry asked.
"Not fast enough," said Hagrid. "It's not easy ter catch a unicorn,
they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before."
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;
there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of
unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
"You all right, Hermione?" Hagrid whispered. "Don' worry, it can't've
gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- GET
BEHIND THAT TREE!"
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a
towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow,
raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was
slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing
along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few
seconds, the sound faded away.
"I knew it, " he murmured. "There's summat in here that shouldn' be."
"A werewolf?" Harry suggested.
"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither," said Hagrid
grimly. "Right, follow me, but careful, now."
They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.
"Who's there?" Hagrid called. "Show yerself -- I'm armed!"
And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a
man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming
chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws
dropped.
"Oh, it's you, Ronan," said Hagrid in relief. "How are yeh?"
He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.
"Good evening to you, Hagrid," said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful
voice. "Were you going to shoot me?"
"Can't be too careful, Ronan," said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.
"There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an'
Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is
Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.))
"We'd noticed," said Hermione faintly.
"Good evening," said Ronan. "Students, are you? And do you learn much,
up at the school?"
"Erm --"
"A bit," said Hermione timidly.
"A bit. Well, that's something." Ronan sighed. He flung back his head
and stared at the sky. "Mars is bright tonight."
"Yeah," said Hagrid, glancing up, too. "Listen, I'm glad we've run inter
yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?"
Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then
sighed again.
"Always the innocent are the first victims," he said. "So it has been
for ages past, so it is now."
"Yeah," said Hagrid, "but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Anythin'
unusual?"
"Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him
impatiently. "Unusually bright."
"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said
Hagrid. "So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?"
Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, "The forest
hides many secrets."
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,
but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and
wilder-looking than Ronan.
"Hullo, Bane," said Hagrid. "All right?"
"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?"
"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in
here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin'
about it?"
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. "Mars is
bright tonight," he said simply.
"We've heard," said Hagrid grumpily. "Well, if either of you do see
anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then."
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their
shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.
"Never," said Hagrid irritably, "try an' get a straight answer out of a
centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the
moon."
"Are there many of them in here?" asked Hermione.
"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're
good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind,
centaurs... they know things... jus' don' let on much."
"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?" said Harry.
"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's
bin killin' the unicorns -- never heard anythin' like it before."
They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking
nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being
watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.
They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's
arm.
"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!"
"You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted. "Stay on the path, I'll come back
for yeh!"
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking
at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the
rustling of leaves around them.
"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?" whispered Hermione.
"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our
fault he's here in the first place."
The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's
seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.
What was going on? Where were the others?
At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy,
Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed,
had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had
panicked and sent up the sparks.
"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were
makin'. Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an'
Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry," Hagrid
added in a whisper to Harry, "but he'll have a harder time frightenin'
you, an' we've gotta get this done."
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They
walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until
the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so
thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were
splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been
thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead,
through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.
"Look --" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen
anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at
odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on
the dark leaves.
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him
freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered....
Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the
ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood
transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head
over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.
"AAAAAAAAAARGH!"
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded
figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was
dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward
Harry -- he couldn't move for fear.
Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as
though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He
heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over
Harry, charging at the figure.
The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a
minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur
was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he
had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
"Are you all right?" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?"
The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale
sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar
that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.
"You are the Potter boy," he said. "You had better get back to Hagrid.
The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride?
It will be quicker this way.
"My name is Firenze," he added, as he lowered himself on to his front
legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the
clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks
heaving and sweaty.
"Firenze!" Bane thundered. "What are you doing? You have a human on
your
back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?"
"Do you realize who this is?" said Firenze. "This is the Potter boy. The
quicker he leaves this forest, the better."
"What have you been telling him?" growled Bane. "Remember, Firenze,
we
are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read
what is to come in the movements of the planets?"
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. "I'm sure Firenze thought he was
acting for the best, " he said in his gloomy voice.
Bane kicked his back legs in anger.
"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with
what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like
donkeys after stray humans in our forest!"
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had
to grab his shoulders to stay on.
"Do you not see that unicorn?" Firenze bellowed at Bane. "Do you not
understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that
secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes,
with humans alongside me if I must."
And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,
they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.
"Why's Bane so angry?" he asked. "What was that thing you saved me
from,
anyway?"
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of
low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made
their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought
Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a
particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly
stopped.
"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?"
"No," said Harry, startled by the odd question. "We've only used the
horn and tail hair in Potions."
"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn," said
Firenze. "Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain,
would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive,
even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have
slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have
but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your
lips."
Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in
the moonlight.
"But who'd be that desperate?" he wondered aloud. "If you're going to be
cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?"
"It is," Firenze agreed, "unless all you need is to stay alive long
enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to
full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.
Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very
moment?"
"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't
understand who --"
"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,
who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's
heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what
Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: "Some say he died.
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to
die."
"Do you mean," Harry croaked, "that was Vol-"
"Harry! Harry, are you all right?"
Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along
behind her.
"I'm fine," said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. "The
unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there."
"This is where I leave you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to
examine the unicorn. "You are safe now."
Harry slid off his back.
"Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze. "The planets have been read
wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those
times."
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry
shivering behind him.
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to
return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly
shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as
Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He
was still shaking.
"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the
forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get
rich...."
"Stop saying the name!" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he
thought Voldemort could hear them.
Harry wasn't listening.
"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so.... Bane was furious...
he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to
happen.... They must show that Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thinks
Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that's written
in the stars as well."
"Will you stop saying the name!" Ron hissed.
"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone," Harry
went on feverishly, "then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me
off... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy."
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.
"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was
ever
afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you.
Anyway,
who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,
and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic."
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed
exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.
When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak
folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:
Just in case.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed
to
get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting
through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could
be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.
It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did
their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the
exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.
They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by
one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across
a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox
-- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if
it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks
while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.
Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his
forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the
forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because
Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by
his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there
was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest,
or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron
and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea
of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in
dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much
time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.
Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering
questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons
and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam
results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put
down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help
cheering with the rest.
"That was far easier than I thought it would be," said Hermione as they
joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. "I needn't have
learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of
Elfric the Eager."
Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but
Ron
said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and
flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the
tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. "No
more studying," Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. "You
could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how
badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet."
Harry was rubbing his forehead.
"I wish I knew what this means!" he burst out angrily. "My scar keeps
hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this."
"Go to Madam Pomfrey," Hermione suggested.
"I'm not ill," said Harry. "I think it's a warning... it means danger's
coming...."
Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.
"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as
Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found
out
how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not
going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for
England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down."
Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was
something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to
explain this, Hermione said, "That's just the exams. I woke up last
night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I
remembered we'd done that one."
Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do
with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across
the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only
one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --
Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.
"Where're you going?" said Ron sleepily.
"I've just thought of something," said Harry. He had turned white.
"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now."
"Why?" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.
"Don't you think it's a bit odd," said Harry, scrambling up the grassy
slope, "that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and
a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How
many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?
Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?"
"What are you talking about?" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the
grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and
sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.
"Hullo," he said, smiling. "Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?"
"Yes, please," said Ron, but Harry cut him off.
"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know
that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards
with look like?"
"Dunno," said Hagrid casually, "he wouldn' take his cloak off."
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.
"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head --
that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn'
he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up."
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. "What did you talk to him
about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?"
"Mighta come up," said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.
"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here....
He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told
him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an'
then... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks....
Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play
cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he
didn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a
dragon would be easy..."
"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?" Harry asked, try ing
to keep his voice calm.
"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around
Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to
calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off
ter sleep --"
Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!" he blurted out. "Forget I said it! Hey --
where're yeh goin'?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they
came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy
after the grounds.
"We've got to go to Dumbledore," said Harry. "Hagrid told that stranger
how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that
cloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope
Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop
him. Where's Dumbledore's office?"
They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the
right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor
did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.
"We'll just have to --" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across
the hall.
"What are you three doing inside?"
It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.
"We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather bravely,
Harry and Ron thought.
"See Professor Dumbledore?" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though
this was a very fishy thing to want to do. "Why?"
Harry swallowed -- now what?
"It's sort of secret," he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because
Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.
"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago," she said coldly. "He
received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for
London at once."
"He's gone?" said Harry frantically. "Now?"
"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many
demands on his time --
"But this is important."
"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic,
Potter.
"Look," said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, "Professor -- it's
about the Sorcerer's tone --"
Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books
she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.
"How do you know --?" she spluttered.
"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone's going to try
and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore."
She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow," she said finally. I don't
know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can
possibly steal it, it's too well protected."
"But Professor --"
"Potter, I know what I'm talking about," she said shortly. She bent down
and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and
enjoy the sunshine."
But they didn't.
"It's tonight," said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was
out of earshot. "Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found
out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He
sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when
Dumbledore turns up."
"But what can we --"
Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.
Snape was standing there.
"Good afternoon," he said smoothly.
They stared at him.
"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this," he said, with an odd,
twisted smile.
"We were --" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.
"You want to be more careful," said Snape. "Hanging around
like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor
really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?"
Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.
"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will
personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you."
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.
Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.
"Right, here's what we've got to do," he whispered urgently. "One of us
has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and
follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that."
"Why me?"
"It's obvious," said Ron. "You can pretend to be waiting for Professor
Flitwick, you know." He put on a high voice, "'Oh Professor Flitwick,
I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'"
"Oh, shut up," said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for
Snape.
"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor," Harry told Ron.
"Come on."
But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the
door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor
McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.
"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of
enchantments!" she stormed. "Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you 've
come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from
Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!" Harry and Ron went
back to
the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione's on Snape's
tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came
in.
"I'm sorry, Harry!" she wailed. "Snape came out and asked me what I was
doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him,
and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went."
"Well, that's it then, isn't it?" Harry said.
The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.
"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone
first."
"You're mad!" said Ron.
"You can't!" said Hermione. "After what McGonagall and Snape have
said?
You'll be expelled!"
"SO WHAP" Harry shouted. "Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of
the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like
when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get
expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark
Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think
he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house
cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to
go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's
only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over
to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing
you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents,
remember?"
He glared at them.
"You're right Harry," said Hermione in a small voice.
"I'll use the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It's just lucky I got it
back."
"But will it cover all three of us?" said Ron.
"All -- all three of us?"
"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?"
"Of course not," said Hermione briskly. "How do you think you'd get to
the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there
might be something useful..."
"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too."
"Not if I can help it," said Hermione grimly. "Flitwick told me in
secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not
throwing me out after that."
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.
Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to
Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset
by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come
across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry
and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they
were about to do.
Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.
"Better get the cloak," Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,
stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He
putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had
given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't
feel much like singing.
He ran back down to the common room.
"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of
us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --"
"What are you doing?" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville
appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked
as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.
"Nothing, Neville, nothing," said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak
behind his back.
Neville stared at their guilty faces.
"You're going out again," he said.
"No, no, no," said Hermione. "No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed,
Neville?"
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford
to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.
"You can't go out," said Neville, "you'll be caught again. Gryffindor
will be in even more trouble."
"You don't understand," said Harry, "this is important."
But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.
I won't let you do it," he said, hurrying to stand in front of the
portrait hole. "I'll -- I'll fight you!"
"Neville, "Ron exploded, "get away from that hole and don't be an idiot
--"
"Don't you call me an idiot!" said Neville. I don't think you should be
breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up
to
people!"
"Yes, but not to us," said Ron in exasperation. "Neville, you don't know
what you're doing."
He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt
out of sight.
"Go on then, try and hit me!" said Neville, raising his fists. "I'm
ready!"
Harry turned to Hermione.
"Do something," he said desperately.
Hermione stepped forward.
"Neville," she said, "I'm really, really sorry about this."
She raised her wand.
"Petrificus Totalus!" she cried, pointing it at Neville.
Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole
body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face,
stiff as a board.
Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he
couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.
"What've you done to him?" Harry whispered.
"It's the full Body-Bind," said Hermione miserably. "Oh, Neville, I'm so
sorry."
"We had to, Neville, no time to explain," said Harry.
"You'll understand later, Neville," said Ron as they stepped over him
and pulled on the invisibility cloak.
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a
very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked
like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping
down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.
Norris skulking near the top.
"Oh, let's kick her, just this once," Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but
Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris
turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.
They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the
third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that
people would trip.
"Who's there?" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed
his wicked black eyes. "Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are
you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?"
He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.
"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen."
Harry had a sudden idea.
"Peeves," he said, in a hoarse whisper, "the Bloody Baron has his own
reasons for being invisible."
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time
and hovered about a foot off the stairs.
"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir," he said greasily. "My
mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're
invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir."
"I have business here, Peeves," croaked Harry. "Stay away from this
place tonight."
"I will, sir, I most certainly will," said Peeves, rising up in the air
again. "Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you."
And he scooted off
"Brilliant, Harry!" whispered Ron.
A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor
-- and the door was already ajar.
"Well, there you are," Harry said quietly, "Snape's already got past
Fluffy."
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them
what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other
two.
"If you want to go back, I won't blame you," he said. "You can take the
cloak, I won't need it now."
"Don't be stupid," said Ron.
"We're coming," said Hermione.
Harry pushed the door open.
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of
the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it
couldn't see them.
"What's that at its feet?" Hermione whispered.
"Looks like a harp," said Ron. "Snape must have left it there."
"It must wake up the moment you stop playing," said Harry. "Well, here
goes..."
He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but
from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew
breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and
fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
"Keep playing," Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath
as they approached the giant heads. "I think we'll be able to pull the
door open," said Ron, peering over the dog's back. "Want to go first,
Hermione?"
"No, I don't!"
"All right." Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's
legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and
open.
"What can you see?" Hermione said anxiously.
"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just
have to drop."
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his
attention and pointed at himself.
"You want to go first? Are you sure?" said Ron. "I don't know how deep
this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep."
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog
growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell
back into its deep sleep.
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was
no
sign of the bottom.
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his
fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, "If anything happens to
me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
Dumbledore, right?"
"Right," said Ron.
"See you in a minute, I hope...
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,
down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on
something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the
gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.
"It's okay!" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,
which was the open trapdoor, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!"
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
"What's this stuff?" were his first words.
"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall.
Come on, Hermione!"
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.
"We must be miles under the school , she said.
"Lucky this plant thing's here, really," said Ron.
"Lucky!" shrieked Hermione. "Look at you both!"
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist
snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs
had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant
off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster
the plant wound around them.
"Stop moving!" Hermione ordered them. "I know what this is -- it's
Devil's Snare!"
"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his
neck. "Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!" said Hermione.
"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it
curled around his chest.
"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it
likes the dark and the damp
"So light a fire!" Harry choked.
"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!" Hermione cried, wringing her
hands.
"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?" Ron bellowed. "ARE YOU A WITCH OR
NOT?"
"Oh, right!" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,
muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had
used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it
loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.
Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they
were able to pull free.
"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione," said Harry as he
joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
"Yeah," said Ron, "and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis --
'there's no wood,' honestly."
"This way," said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the
only way forward.
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of
water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and
Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,
he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards'
bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad
enough...
"Can you hear something?" Ron whispered.
Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up
ahead.
"Do you think it's a ghost?"
"I don't know... sounds like wings to me."
"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving."
They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly
lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,
jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the
opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.
"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?" said Ron.
"Probably," said Harry. "They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if
they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll
run."
He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted
across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at
him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched.
He
pulled the handle, but it was locked.
The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it
wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.
"Now what?" said Ron.
"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration," said Hermione.
They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?
"They're not birds!" Harry said suddenly. "They're keys! Winged keys --
look carefully. So that must mean..." he looked around the chamber while
the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes -- look!
Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!"
"But there are hundreds of them!"
Ron examined the lock on the door.
"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the
handle."
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into
the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the
bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to
catch one.
Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He
had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's
weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large
silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and
stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
"That one!" he called to the others. "That big one -- there -- no, there
-- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side."
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into
the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.
"We've got to close in on it!" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the
key with the damaged wing. "Ron, you come at it from above --
Hermione,
stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right,
NOW!"
Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and
Harry
streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and
with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one
hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.
They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in
his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment
the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very
battered now that it had been caught twice.
"Ready?" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They
nodded. He pulled the door open.
The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as
they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an
astonishing sight.
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black
chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what
looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the
white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering
white chessmen had no faces.
"Now what do we do?" Harry whispered.
"It's obvious, isn't it?" said Ron. "We've got to play our way across
the room."
Behind the white pieces they could see another door.
"How?" said Hermione nervously.
"I think," said Ron, "we're going to have to be chessmen."
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the
knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the
ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.
"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?" The black knight
nodded. Ron turned to the other two.
"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we've got to take the
place of three of the black pieces...."
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,
"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at
chess --"
"We're not offended," said Harry quickly. "Just tell us what to do."
"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90
next to him instead of that castle."
"What about you?"
"I'm going to be a knight," said Ron.
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a
knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces
and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,
and Hermione took.
"White always plays first in chess," said Ron, peering across the board.
"Yes... look..."
A white pawn had moved forward two squares.
Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he
sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?
"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right."
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white
queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he
lay quite still, facedown.
"Had to let that happen," said Ron, looking shaken. "Leaves you free to
take that bishop, Hermione, go on."
Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.
Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.
Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in
danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white
pieces as they had lost black ones.
"We're nearly there," he muttered suddenly. "Let me think let me
think..."
The white queen turned her blank face toward him.
"Yes..." said Ron softly, "It's the only way... I've got to be taken."
"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.
"That's chess!" snapped Ron. "You've got to make some sacrifices! I take
one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate
the king, Harry!"
"But --"
"Do you want to stop Snape or not?"
"Ron --"
"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!"
There was no alternative.
"Ready?" Ron called, his face pale but determined. "Here I go - now,
don't hang around once you've won."
He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard
across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -
Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged
Ron
to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.
Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had
won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With
one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through
the door and up the next passageway.
"What if he's --?"
"He'll be all right," said Harry, trying to convince himself. "What do
you reckon's next?"
"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put
charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them
alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's."
They had reached another door.
"All right?" Harry whispered.
"Go on."
Harry pushed it open.
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their
robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in
front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out
cold with a bloody lump on its head.
"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one," Harry whispered as they
stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. "Come on, I can't
breathe."
He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what
came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table
with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
"Snape's," said Harry. "What do we have to do?"
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind
them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At
the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.
They were trapped.
"Look!" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry
looked over her shoulder to read it:
Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,
One among us seven will let you move ahead,
Another will transport the drinker back instead,
Two among our number hold only nettle wine,
Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,
To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:
First, however slyly the poison tries to hide
You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;
Second, different are those who stand at either end,
But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
Fourth, the second left and the second on the right
Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.
Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was
smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
"Brilliant," said Hermione. "This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle.
A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be
stuck in here forever."
"But so will we, won't we?" "Of course not," said Hermione. "Everything
we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are
wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us
back through the purple."
"But how do we know which to drink?"
"Give me a minute."
Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the
line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she
clapped her hands.
"Got it," she said. "The smallest bottle will get us through the black
fire -- toward the Stone."
Harry looked at the tiny bottle.
"There's only enough there for one of us," he said. "That's hardly one
swallow."
They looked at each other.
"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?"
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.
"You drink that," said Harry. "No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab
brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor
and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while,
but I'm no match for him, really."
"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?"
"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?" said Harry, pointing at his scar.
"I might get lucky again."
Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her
arms around him.
"Hermione!"
"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know."
"I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of
him.
"Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important
things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!"
"You drink first," said Harry. "You are sure which is which, aren't
you?"
"Positive," said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle
at the end, and shuddered.
"It's not poison?" said Harry anxiously.
"No -- but it's like ice."
"Quick, go, before it wears off."
"Good luck -- take care."
"GO!"
Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to
face the black flames.
"Here I come," he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle
down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking
his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing
but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.
There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even
Voldemort.
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
THE MAN WITH TWO FACES
It was Quirrell.
"You!" gasped Harry.
Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.
"Me," he said calmly. "I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here,
Potter."
"But I thought -- Snape --"
"Severus?" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble,
either, but cold and sharp. "Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't
he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to
him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?"
Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.
"But Snape tried to kill me!"
"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally
knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch
match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd
have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape
hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."
"Snape was trying to save me?"
"Of course," said Quirrell coolly. do you think he wanted to
referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it
again. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything
with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was
trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular...
and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you
tonight."
Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped
themselves tightly around Harry.
"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on
Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what
was guarding the Stone."
"You let the troll in?"
"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what
I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while
everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already
suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not
only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog
didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.
"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
It was the Mirror of Erised.
"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone," Quirrell murmured,
tapping his way around the frame. "Trust Dumbledore to come up with
something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the
time he gets back...."
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
"I saw you and Snape in the forest --" he blurted out.
"Yes," said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the
back. "He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got.
He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could,
when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...."
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into
it.
"I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?"
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He
had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.
"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much."
"Oh, he does," said Quirrell casually, "heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts
with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never
wanted you dead."
"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was
threatening you...."
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.
"Sometimes," he said, "I find it hard to follow my master's instructions
-- he is a great wizard and I am weak --"
"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?" Harry gasped.
"He is with me wherever I go," said Quirrell quietly. "I met him when I
traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of
ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how
wrong
I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too
weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I
have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me."
Quirrell shivered suddenly. "He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I
failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He
punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...."
Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon
Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that
very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.
Quirrell cursed under his breath.
"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break
it?"
Harry's mind was racing.
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he
thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the
mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I'll see where
it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up
to?
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without
Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he
tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to
himself. "What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!"
And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come
from Quirrell himself
"Use the boy... Use the boy..."
Quirrell rounded on Harry.
"Yes -- Potter -- come here."
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry
got slowly to his feet.
"Come here," Quirrell repeated. "Look in the mirror and tell me what you
see."
Harry walked toward him.
I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I
see, that's all.
Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that
seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in
front of the mirror, and opened them again.
He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment
later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and
pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its
pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his
real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.
"Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. "What do you see?"
Harry screwed up his courage.
"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore," he invented. "I -- I've
won the house cup for Gryffindor."
Quirrell cursed again.
"Get out of the way," he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the
Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?
But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though
Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.
"He lies... He lies..."
"Potter, come back here!" Quirrell shouted. "Tell me the truth! What did
you just see?"
The high voice spoke again.
"Let me speak to him... face-to-face..."
"Master, you are not strong enough!"
"I have strength enough... for this...."
Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't
move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to
unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's
head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the
spot.
Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there
should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most
terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red
eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
"Harry Potter..." it whispered.
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.
"See what I have become?" the face said. "Mere shadow and vapor ... I
have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always
been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn
blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell
drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life,
I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don't you give
me that Stone in your pocket?"
So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He
stumbled backward.
"Don't be a fool," snarled the face. "Better save your own life and join
me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging
me for mercy..."
"LIAR!" Harry shouted suddenly.
Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see
him. The evil face was now smiling.
"How touching..." it hissed. "I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your
parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a
courageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying
to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have
died in vain."
"NEVER!"
Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed "SEIZE
HIM!"
and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At
once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as
though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his
might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head
lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and
saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering
before his eyes.
"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged,
knocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands
around Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain,
yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.
"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!"
And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go
of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see
they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
"Then kill him, fool, and be done!" screeched Voldemort.
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by
instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face --
"AAAARGH!"
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:
Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible
pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough
pain to stop him from doing a curse.
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as
tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the
pain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only
hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, "KILL HIM!
KILL HIM!" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying,
"Harry!
Harry!"
He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and
fell into blackness, down ... down... down...
Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to
catch it, but his arms were too heavy.
He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How
strange.
He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view
above him.
"Good afternoon, Harry," said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he
remembered: "Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir,
quick --"
"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said
Dumbledore. "Quirrell does not have the Stone."
"Then who does? Sir, I --"
"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.
Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the
hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next
to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.
"Tokens from your friends and admirers," said Dumbledore, beaming.
"What
happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a
complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your
friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to
send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam
Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated
it."
"How long have I been in here?"
"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved
you have come round, they have been extremely worried."
"But sit, the Stone
I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor
Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to
prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.
"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?"
"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it
became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just
left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you."
"It was you."
"I feared I might be too late."
"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer --"
"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For
one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has
been destroyed."
"Destroyed?" said Harry blankly. "But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --"
"Oh, you know about Nicolas?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite
delighted.
"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had
a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best."
"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?"
"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then,
yes, they will die."
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.
"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas
and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long
day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great
adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As
much money and life as you could want! The two things most human
beings
would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of
choosing precisely those things that are worst for them." Harry lay
there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the
ceiling.
"Sir?" said Harry. "I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's
gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --"
"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear
of a name increases fear of the thing itself."
"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back,
isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?"
"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking
for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.
He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers
as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his
return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to
fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed
again, and again, why, he may never return to power."
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then
he said, "Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can
tell me... things I want to know the truth about...."
"The truth." Dumbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and terrible thing,
and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall
answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which
case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie."
"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried
to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the
first place?"
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not
now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.
When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are
ready, you will know."
And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.
"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?"
"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot
understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your
mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to
have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone,
will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,
full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,
could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person
marked by something so good."
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,
which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found
his voice again, Harry said, "And the invisibility cloak - do you know
who sent it to me?"
"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought
you might like it." Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "Useful things... your
father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food
when he was here."
"And there's something else..."
"Fire away."
"Quirrell said Snape --"
"Professor Snape, Harry." "Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because
he hated my father. Is that true?"
"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.
Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive."
"What?"
"He saved his life."
"What?"
"Yes..." said Dumbledore dreamily. "Funny, the way people's minds work,
isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt....
I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt
that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to
hating your father's memory in peace...."
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he
stopped.
"And sir, there's one more thing..."
"Just the one?"
"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?"
"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant
ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only
one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be
able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or
drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now,
enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie
Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come
across a vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost
my liking for them -- but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't
you?"
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he
choked and said, "Alas! Ear wax!"
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.
"Just five minutes," Harry pleaded.
"Absolutely not."
"You let Professor Dumbledore in..."
"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need
rest."
"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam
Pomfrey..."
"Oh, very well," she said. "But five minutes only."
And she let Ron and Hermione in.
"Harry!"
Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was
glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.
"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so
worried
--"
"The whole school's talking about it," said Ron. "What really happened?"
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more
strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything:
Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a
very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry
told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
"So the Stone's gone?" said Ron finally. "Flamel's just going to die?"
"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to
the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
"I always said he was off his rocker," said Ron, looking quite impressed
at how crazy his hero was.
"So what happened to you two?" said Harry.
"Well, I got back all right," said Hermione. "I brought Ron round --
that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact
Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew --
he
just said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the
third floor."
"D'you think he meant you to do it?" said Ron. "Sending you your
father's cloak and everything?"
"Well, " Hermione exploded, "if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible
-- you could have been killed."
"No, it isn't," said Harry thoughtfully. "He's a funny man, Dumbledore.
I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or
less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty
good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just
taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me
find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the
right to face Voldemort if I could...."
"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right," said Ron proudly.
"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The
points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last
Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but
the food'll be good."
At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT" she said firmly.
After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.
I want to go to the feast," he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened
his many candy boxes. I can, can't I?"
"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go," she said
stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize
how risky feasts could be. "And you have another visitor."
"Oh, good," said Harry. "Who is it?"
Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was
indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry,
took one look at him, and burst into tears.
"It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!" he sobbed, his face in his hands.
I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only
thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a
dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter
live as a Muggle!"
"Hagrid!" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and
remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. "Hagrid, he'd have
found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have
found out even if you hadn't told him."
"Yeh could've died!" sobbed Hagrid. "An' don' say the name!"
"VOLDEMORT!" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he
stopped
crying. "I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up,
Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate
Frog, I've got loads...."
Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, "That reminds
me. I've got yeh a present."
"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?" said Harry anxiously, and at last
Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. "Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off
yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway,
got yeh this..."
It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it
curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him
from every page were his mother and father.
"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer
photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?"
Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He
had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving
him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked
out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's
winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner
showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody
started
talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione
at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were
standing up to look at him.
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.
"Another year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. "And I must trouble
you
with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our
delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a
little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get
them nice and empty before next year starts....
"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the
points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and
twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two;
Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred
and seventy- two."
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a
sickening sight.
"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin," said Dumbledore. "However, recent
events must be taken into account."
The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.
"Ahem," said Dumbledore. "I have a few last-minute points to dish out.
Let me see. Yes...
"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley..."
Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor house fifty points."
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars
overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other
prefects, "My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past
McGonagall's giant chess set!"
At last there was silence again.
"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the
face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points."
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had
burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside
themselves -- they were a hundred points up. "Third -- to Mr. Harry
Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve
and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points."
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points
-- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if
only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.
Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.
"There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a
great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to
stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville
Longbottom."
Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some
sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted
from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and
cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people
hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who
couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the
Body-Bind Curse put on him.
"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even
Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, "we
need a little change of decoration."
He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet
and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a
towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor
McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye
and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed
one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back
to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.
It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at
Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would
never, ever forget tonight.
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but
come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good
marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even
Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his
abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as
stupid
as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a
shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,
Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were
handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the
holidays ("I always hope they'll forget to give us these," said Fred
Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats
that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;
talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier;
eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns;
pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling
into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened
old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate
in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out
of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.
"You must come and stay this summer," said Ron, "both of you -- I'll
send you an owl."
"Thanks," said Harry, "I'll need something to look forward to." People
jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the
Muggle
world. Some of them called:
"Bye, Harry!"
"See you, Potter!"
"Still famous," said Ron, grinning at him.
"Not where I'm going, I promise you," said Harry.
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. "There he is,
Mom, there he is, look!"
It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at
Ron.
"Harry Potter!" she squealed. "Look, Mom! I can see
"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point."
Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.
"Busy year?" she said.
"Very," said Harry. "Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.
Weasley."
"Oh, it was nothing, dear."
"Ready, are you?"
It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking
furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station
full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley,
looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.
"You must be Harry's family!" said Mrs. Weasley.
"In a manner of speaking," said Uncle Vernon. "Hurry up, boy, we haven't
got all day." He walked away.
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
"See you over the summer, then."
"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday," said Hermione, looking
uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so
unpleasant.
"Oh, I will," said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was
spreading over his face. "They don't know we're not allowed to use magic
at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...."
THE END

HARRY POTTER AND
THE CHAMBER OF
SECRETS
J. K. Rowling
CHAPTER ONE
THE WORST BIRTHDAY
Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at
number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in
the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his
nephew Harry's room.
"Third time this week!" he roared across the table. "If you can't
control that owl, it'll have to go!"
Harry tried, yet again, to explain.
"She's bored," he said. "She's used to flying around outside. If I could
just let her out at night -"
"Do I look stupid?" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling
from his bushy mustache. "I know what'll happen if that owl's let
out."
He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.
Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,
loud belch from the Dursleys' son, Dudley.
"I want more bacon."
"There's more in the frying pan, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia,
turning misty eyes on her massive son. "We must build you up while
we've got the chance .... I don't like the sound of that school food
......
"Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,"
said Uncle Vernon heartily. "Dudley gets enough, don't you, son?"
Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the
kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.
"Pass the frying pan."
"You've forgotten the magic word," said Harry irritably.
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was
incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that
shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and
clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet,
veins throbbing in his temples.
"I meant said Harry quickly. "I didn't mean -"
"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU," thundered his uncle, spraying spit
over the table, "ABOUT SAYING THE WORD IN OUR
HOUSE?"
"But I -"
"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!" roared Uncle
Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.
"I just -"
"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF
YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!"
Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was
trying to heave Dudley to his feet.
"All right," said Harry, "all right. . . "
Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and
watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.
Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle
Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any
moment, because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy. As a matter of
fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.
Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys
were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how
Harry felt.
He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant
stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and
ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the
mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his
four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper,
Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and,
especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world
(six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on
broomsticks).
All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line
Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard
under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home.
What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House
Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? What was it
to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his
homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles
(not a drop of magical blood in their veins),
and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was
a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked
Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying
messages to anyone in the wizarding world.
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was
large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia
was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry,
on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and
jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on
his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a
wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of
the reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years
before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from
the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name
most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents had
died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning
scar, and somehow - nobody understood why Voldemort's powers had
been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.
So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her
husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never
understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning
to, believing the Dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the car
crash that had killed his parents.
And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry,
and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at
wizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now the
school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the
summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something
smelly.
The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be
Harry's twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd
never given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it
completely ...
At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,
"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day."
Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.
"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, "
said Uncle Vernon.
Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Un
cle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He'd been talk
ing of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife
were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge
order from him (Uncle Vernon's company made drills).
"I think we should run through the schedule one more time," said
Uncle Vernon. "We should all be in position at eight o'clock. Petunia,
you will be -?"
"In the lounge," said Aunt Petunia promptly, "waiting to welcome them
graciously to our home."
"Good, good. And Dudley?"
"I'll be waiting to open the door." Dudley put on a foul, simpering
smile. "May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?"
"They'll love him!" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.
"Excellent, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry.
"And you?"
"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not
there," said Harry tonelessly.
"Exactly," said Uncle Vernon nastily. "I will lead them into the
lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them -drinks. At eightfifteen -"
"I'll announce dinner," said Aunt Petunia.
"And, Dudley, you'll say -"
"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?" said
Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.
"My perfect little gentleman!" sniffed Aunt Petunia.
"And you?" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.
"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,"
said Harry dully.
"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at
dinner. Petunia, any ideas?"
"Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell me
where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ......
"Perfect. . . Dudley?"
"How about -'We had to write an essay about our hero at school,
Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you."'
This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia
burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the
table so they wouldn't see him laughing.
"And you, boy?"
Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.
"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,"
he said.
"Too right, you will," said Uncle Vernon forcefully. "The Ma
sons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way.
When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for
coffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With any
luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten.
be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to
morrow.
Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think the
Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on
Privet Drive.
"Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for
Dudley and me. And you," he snarled at Harry. "You stay out of
your aunt's way while she's cleaning."
Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day.
He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang
under his breath:
"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . .
No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening
pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had
never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more
even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron
Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to be
missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer,
even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and
stay.
Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking
Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione
with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't
allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the
Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them
all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the
cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first
couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words
under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast
as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and
Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that
even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione
had forgotten his birthday.
What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any
witch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy,
Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream ....
Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of
last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord
Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but
he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.
Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but
it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept
waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where
Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes
Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been
staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back.
Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.
Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the
lawn.
"I know what day it is," sang Dudley, waddling toward him.
The huge eyes blinked and vanished.
"What?" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had
been.
"I know what day it is," Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.
"Well done," said Harry. "So you've finally learned the days of the
week."
"Today's your birthday," sneered Dudley. "How come you haven't got
any cards? Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?"
"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school," said
Harry coolly.
Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat
bottom.
"Why're you staring at the hedge?" he said suspiciously.
" I , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on
fire," said Harry.
Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.
"You c-can't - Dad told you you're not to do m-magic - he said he'll
chuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go -
you haven't got any friends to take you -"
"Jiggery pokery!" said Harry in a fierce voice. "Hocus pocus squiggly
wiggly -"
"MUUUUUUM!" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed
back toward the house. "MUUUUM! He's doing you know what!"
Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor
the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really
done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his
head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with
the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.
While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry
cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the
flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden
bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry
knew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said
the very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn't have
any friends at Hogwarts ....
Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he
spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running
down his face.
It was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, he
heard Aunt Petunia calling him.
"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!"
Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of
the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream
and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.
"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!" snapped Aunt Petunia,
pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen
table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.
Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The
moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate.
"Upstairs! Hurry!"
As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a
glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jack
ets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door
bell rang and Uncle Vernon's furious face appeared at the foot of
the stairs.
"Remember, boy - one sound -"
Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed
the door, and turned to collapse on his bed.
The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.
C H A P T E R T W O
DOBBY'S WARNING
arry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little
creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the
size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been
watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.
As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall.
"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?"
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its
long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing
what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.
"Er - hello," said Harry nervously.
"Harry Potter!" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was
sure would carry down the stairs. "So long has Dobby wanted to meet
you, sir ... Such an honor it is . . . ."
"Th-thank you," said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his
desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He
wanted to ask, "What are you?" but thought it would sound too rude,
so instead he said, "Who are you?"
"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf," said the creature.
"Oh - really?" said Harry. "Er - I don't want to be rude or anything,
but - this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my
bedroom."
Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf
hung his head.
"Not that I'm not pleased to meet you," said Harry quickly, "but, er,
is there any particular reason you're here?"
"Oh, yes, sir," said Dobby earnestly. "Dobby has come to tell you,
sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin . . . ."
"Sit down," said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.
To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears.
"S-sit down!" he wailed. "Never ... never ever. . . "
Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.
"I'm sorry," he whispered, "I didn't mean to offend you or anything -"
"Offend Dobby!" choked the elf. "Dobby has never been asked to sit
down by a wizard - like an equal-"
Harry, trying to say "Shh!" and look comforting at the same time,
ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking
like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself,
and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery
adoration.
"You can't have met many decent wizards," said Harry, trying to
cheer him up.
Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and
started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, "Bad
Dobby! Bad Dobby!"
"Don't - what are you doing?" Harry hissed, springing up and pulling
Dobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with a
particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the
bars of her cage.
"Dobby had to punish himself, sir," said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. "Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir . . . ."
"Your family?"
"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir... DOBBY'S is a houseelf -
bound to serve one house and one family forever . .....
"Do they know you're here?" asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
"Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously
for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the
oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir
"But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?"
"Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for
something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they
reminds me to do extra punishments ......
"But why don't you leave? Escape?"
"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set
Dobby free ... Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir . . . ."
Harry stared.
"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,"
he said. "This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can't anyone
help you? Can't I?"
Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn't spoken. Dobby dissolved again
into wails of gratitude.
"Please," Harry whispered frantically, "please be quiet. If the Dursleys
hear anything, if they know you're here -"
"Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby ... Dobby has heard of your
greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew . .....
Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, "Whatever
you've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I'm not even top
of my year at Hogwarts; that's Hermione, she -"
But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.
"I-Tarry Potter is humble and modest," said Dobby reverently, his orblike eyes aglow. "Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named -"
"Voldemort?" said Harry.
Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, "Ah, speak not
the name, sir! Speak not the name!"
"Sorry" said Harry quickly. "I know lots of people don't like it. My
friend Ron -"
He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.
'Dobby heard tell," he said hoarsely, "that Harry Potter met the Dark
Lord for a second time just weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped
Yet again. "
Harry nodded and Dobby's eyes suddenly shone with tears.
,Ah, sir," he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby
pillowcase he was wearing. "Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has
braved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect
Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in
the oven door later... Harry Potter must notgo back to Hogwarts."
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks
from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice.
"W-what?" Harry stammered. "But I've got to go back - term starts
on September first. It's all that's keeping me going. You don't know
what it's like here. I don't belong here. I belong in your world - at
Hogwarts."
"No, no, no," squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears
flapped. "Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great,
too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be
in mortal danger."
"Why?" said Harry in surprise.
"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things
happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,"
whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. "Dobby has known it
for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too
important, sir!"
"What terrible things?" said Harry at once. "Who's plotting them?"
Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head
frantically against the wall.
"All right!" cried Harry, grabbing the elf's arm to stop him. "You can't
tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?" A sudden,
unpleasant thought struck him. "Hang on - this hasn't got anything to
do with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it?
You could just shake or nod," he added hastily as Dobby's head
tilted worryingly close to the wall again.
Slowly, Dobby shook his head.
"Not -not He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir
But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give
Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.
"He hasn't got a brother, has he?"
Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.
"Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making
horrible things happen at Hogwarts," said Harry. "I mean, there's
Dumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don't
you?"
Dobby bowed his head.
"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever
had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powers
rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his
strength. But, sir" - Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper -
"there are powers Dumbledore doesn't ... powers no decent wizard.
. ."
And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed,
seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around the
head with earsplitting yelps.
A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart
thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling,
"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!"
"Quick! In the closet!" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the
door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.
"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?" said Uncle Vernon through
gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry's. "You've just ruined the
punch line of my Japanese golfer joke .... One more sound and you'll
wish you'd never been born, boy!"
He stomped flat-footed from the room.
Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.
"See what it's like here?" he said. "See why I've got to go back to
Hogwarts? It's the only place I've got -well, I think I've got friends. "
"Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?" said Dobby slyly.
"I expect they've just been - wait a minute," said Harry, frowning.
"How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?"
Dobby shuffled his feet.
"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best -
"
"Have you been stopping my letters?"
"Dobby has them here, sir," said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry's
reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the
pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione's neat
writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though
it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.
"Harry Potter mustn't be angry... Dobby hoped ... if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him ... Harry Potter might not want to
go back to school, sir . .....
Harry wasn't listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby
jumped out of reach.
"Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word
that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must
not face! Say you won't go back, sir!"
"No," said Harry angrily. "Give me my friends' letters!"
"Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice," said the elf sadly.
Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door,
pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.
Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to
make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the
hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he
heard Uncle Vernon saying, ". . . tell Petunia that very funny story
about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She's been dying to
hear. . . "
Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.
Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and
sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a
cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.
"No," croaked Harry. "Please ... they'll kill me ......
"Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school -"
"Dobby ... please ...
"Say it, sir -"
"I can't -"
Dobby gave him a tragic look.
"Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good."
The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream
splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack
like a whip, Dobby vanished.
There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon
burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head
to foot in Aunt Petunias pudding.
At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the
whole thing over. ("Just our nephew - very disturbed
meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs ) He
shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised
Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Ma
sons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice
cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing
the kitchen clean.
Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn't
been for the owl.
Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when
a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a
letter on Mrs. Mason's head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason
screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about
lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his
wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask
whether this was their idea of a joke.
Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle
Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.
"Read it!" he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered.
"Go on - read it!"
Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.
Dear Mr. Potter,
We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your
place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.
As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells
outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to
expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of
Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).
We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that
risks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is
a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation
of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy.
Enjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely,
Mafalda Hopkirk
IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE
Ministry of Magic
Harry looked up from the letter and gulped.
"You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,"
said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. "For got to
mention it .... Slipped your mind, I daresay .....
He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth
bared. "Well, I've got news for you, boy . ... I'm locking you up ....
You're never going back to that school ... never ... and if you try and
magic yourself out - they'll expel you!"
And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs.
Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning,
he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a catflap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be
pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the
bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room
around the clock.
Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and
Harry couldn't see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed
watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered
miserably what was going to happen to him.
What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts
would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an
all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren't going to wake
up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved
Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were
going, he'd probably starve to death anyway.
The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl
of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with
hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but
he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's
cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into
her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of
deep disgust.
"It's no good turning your beak up at it - that's all we've got," said
Harry grimly.
He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay
back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been
before the soup.
Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen
if he didn't turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why
he hadn't come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let
him go?
The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind
spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an
uneasy sleep.
He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading
UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars
at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw
Dobby's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby
called, "Harry Potter is safe there, sir!" and vanished. Then the
Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at
him.
"Stop it," Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head.
"Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I'm trying to sleep . . . ."
He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the
window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a frecklefaced, red-haired, long-nosed someone.
Ron Weasley was outside Harry's window.
C H A P T E R T H R E E
THE BURROW
Ron.l" breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so
they could talk through the bars. "Ron, how did you - What the -?"
Harry's mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit
him. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car,
which was parked in midair Grinning at Harry from the front seats
were Fred and George, Ron's elder twin brothers.
"All right, Harry?" asked George.
"What's been going on?" said Ron. "Why haven't you been answering
my letters? I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad
came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in
front of Muggles -"
"It wasn't me - and how did he know?"
"He works for the Ministry," said Ron. "You know we're not supposed
to do spells outside school -"
"You should talk," said Harry, staring at the floating car.
"Oh, this doesn't count," said Ron. "We're only borrowing this. It's
Dad's, we didn't enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles
you live with -"
"I told you, I didn't - but it'll take too long to explain now look, can you
tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't
let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the
Ministry'Il think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so -"
"Stop gibbering," said Ron. "We've come to take you home with us."
"But you can't magic me out either -"
"We don't need to," said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat
and grinning. "You forget who I've got with me."
"Tie that around the bars," said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to
Harry.
"If the Dursleys wake up, I'm dead," said Harry as he tied the rope
tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
"Don't worry," said Fred, "and stand back."
Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to
have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car
revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the
bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in
the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few
feet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car.
Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys'
bedroom.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed
as close as possible to Harry's window.
"Get in," Ron said.
"But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick -"
"Where is it?"
"Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can't get out of this
room -"
"No problem," said George from the front passenger seat. "Out of
the way, Harry."
Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry's
room. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an
ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.
"A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of
Muggle trick," said Fred, "but we feel they're skills worth learning,
even if they are a bit slow."
There was a small click and the door swung open.
"So - we'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your
room and hand it out to Ron," whispered George.
"Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks," Harry whispered back
as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.
Harry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them
out of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George
heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.
At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk
through Harry's room to the open window. Fred climbed back into
the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the
bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.
Uncle Vernon coughed again.
"A bit more," panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car.
"One good push -"
Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid
out of the window into the back seat of the car.
"Okay, let's go," George whispered.
But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud
screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of
Uncle Vernon's voice.
"THAT RUDDY OWL!"
"I've forgotten Hedwig!"
Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he
snatched up Hedwig's cage, dashed to the window, and passed it
out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when
Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open.
For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then
he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing
him by the ankle.
Ron, Fred, and George seized Harry's arms and pulled as hard as
they could.
"Petunia!" roared Uncle Vernon. "He's getting away! HE'S
GETTING AWAY!"
But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry's leg slid out of
Uncle Vernon's grasp - Harry was in the car - he'd slammed the
door shut
"Put your foot down, Fred!" yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly
toward the moon.
Harry couldn't believe it - he was free. He rolled down the
window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the
shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and
Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry's window.
"See you next summer!" Harry yelled.
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat,
grinning from ear to ear.
"Let Hedwig out," he told Ron. "She can fly behind us. She hasn't had
a chance to stretch her wings for ages."
George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared
joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost.
"So - what's the story, Harry?" said Ron impatiently. "What's been
happening?"
Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning he'd given Harry and
the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence
when he had finished.
"Very fishy," said Fred finally.
"Definitely dodgy" agreed George. "So he wouldn't even tell you who's
supposed to be plotting all this stuff?"
"I don't think he could," said Harry. "I told you, every time he got close
to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall."
He saw Fred and George look at each other.
"What, you think he was lying to me?" said Harry.
"Well," said Fred, "put it this way - house-elves have got powerful
magic of their own, but they can't usually use it without their master's
permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you com
ing back to Hogwarts. Someone's idea of a joke. Can you think of
anyone at school with a grudge against you?"
"Yes," said Harry and Ron together, instantly.
"Draco Malfoy," Harry explained. "He hates me."
"Draco Malfoy?" said George, turning around. "Not Lucius Malfoy's
son?"
"Must be, it's not a very common name, is it?" said Harry.
"I've heard Dad talking about him," said George. "He was a big
supporter of You-Know-Who."
"And when You-Know-Who disappeared," said Fred, craning
around to look at Harry, "Lucius Malfoy came back saying he'd never
meant any of it. Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in YouKnow-Who's inner circle."
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before, and they
didn't surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look
like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
"I don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf said
Harry.
"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'll
be rich," said Fred.
"Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,"
said George. "But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and
gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors
and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house .
. . ."
Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had
the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he
could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending
the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also
sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry
been stupid to take Dobby seriously?
"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway," said Ron. "I was getting
really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought it
was Errol's fault at first-"
"Who's Errol?"
"Our owl. He's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed
on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -"
"Who?"
"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,"
said Fred from the front.
"But Percy wouldn't lend him to me," said Ron. "Said he needed
him."
"Percy's been acting very oddly this summer," said George,
frowning. "And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a
load of time shut up in his room .... I mean, there's only so many
times you can polish a prefect badge .... You're driving too far west,
Fred," he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred
twiddled the steering wheel.
"So, does your dad know you've got the car?" said Harry, guessing
the answer.
"Er, no," said Ron, "he had to work tonight. Hopefully we'll be able
to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it."
"What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?"
"He works in the most boring department," said Ron. "The Misuse
of Muggle Artifacts Office."
"The what?"
"It's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you
know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like,
last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques
shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve
her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime
for weeks."
"What happened?"
"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place
and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped
to his nose. Dad was going frantic - it's only him and an old warlock
called Perkins in the office -and they had to do Memory Charms and
all sorts of stuff to cover it up -"
"But your dad - this car -"
Fred laughed. "Yeah, Dad's crazy about everything to do with
Muggles; our shed's full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells
on it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he'd
have to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad."
"That's the main road," said George, peering down through the
windshield. "We'll be there in ten minutes .... Just as well, it's getting
light . . . ."
A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.
Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of
fields and clumps of trees.
"We're a little way outside the village," said George. "Ottery St.
Catchpole."
Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun
was now gleaming through the trees.
"Touchdown!" said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground.
They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and
Harry looked out for the first time at Ron's house.
It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra
rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high
and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which,
Harry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were
perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground
near the entrance read, THE BuRRow. Around the front door lay a jumble
of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens
were pecking their way around the yard.
"It's not much," said Ron.
"It's wonderful," said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive.
They got out of the car.
"Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly," said Fred, "and wait for Mum to
call us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going,
look who turned up in the night!' and she'll be all pleased to see
Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car."
"Right," said Ron. "Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the top
Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The
other three wheeled around.
Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and
for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much
she looked like a saber-toothed tiger.
"Ah, "said Fred.
"Oh, dear," said George.
Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips,
staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered
apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.
"So, "she said.
"Morning, Mum," said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty,
winning voice.
"Have you any idea how worried I've been?" said Mrs. Weasley in a
deadly whisper.
"Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to -"
All three of Mrs. Weasley's sons were taller than she was, but they
cowered as her rage broke over them.
"Beds empty! No note! Cargone - could have crashed - out of my
mind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I've lived -
you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this
from Bill or Charlie or Percy -"
"Perfect Percy," muttered Fred.
"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S
BOOK!" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest. "You
could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your
father his job -"
It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself
hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.
"I'm very pleased to see you, Harry, dear," she said. "Come in and
have some breakfast."
She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous
glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.
The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a
scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down
on the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard
house before.
The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers
at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time
to feed the chickens, and You're late. Books were stacked three deep on
the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese,
Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It's Magic! And unless
Harry's ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just
announced that coming up was "Witching Hour, with the popular
singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck."
Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little
haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages
into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like "don't
know what you were thinking of," and "never would have believed it."
"I don't blame you, dear," she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine
sausages onto his plate. "Arthur and I have been worried about you,
too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if
you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really," (she was now
adding three fried eggs to his plate) "flying an illegal car halfway
across the country - anyone could have seen you -"
She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to
clean themselves, clinking gently in the background.
"It was cloudy, Mum!" said Fred.
"You keep your mouth closed while you're eating!" Mrs. Weasley
snapped.
"They were starving him, Mum!" said George.
"And you!" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened
expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for
him.
At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small,
redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen,
gave a small squeal, and ran out again.
"Ginny," said Ron in an undertone to Harry. "My sister. She's been
talking about you all summer."
"Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Harry," Fred said with a grin,
but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without
another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean,
which took a surprisingly short time.
"Blimey, I'm tired," yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last.
"I think I'll go to bed and -"
"You will not," snapped Mrs. Weasley. "It's your own fault you've
been up all night. You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they're
getting completely out of hand again -"
"Oh, Mum -"
"And you two," she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. "You can go up to
bed, dear," she added to Harry. "You didn't ask them to fly that
wretched car -"
But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, "I'll help Ron. I've
never seen a de-gnoming -"
"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work," said Mrs. Weasley.
"Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject -"
And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece.
George groaned.
"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -"
Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across it
in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to
Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very goodIOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always
in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who
Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at
them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.
"Oh, he is marvelous," she said. "He knows his household pests, all
right, it's a wonderful book . . . ."
"Mum fancies him," said Fred, in a very audible whisper.
"Don't be so ridiculous, Fred," said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather
pink. "All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go
and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that
garden when I come out to inspect it."
Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry
behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactlY
what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - there
were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were
gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling
from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.
"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know," Harry told Ron
they crossed the lawn.
"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes," said Ron, bent
double with his head in a peony bush, "like fat little Santa Clauses with
fishing rods . . . ."
There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and
Ron straightened up. "This is a gnome," he said grimly.
"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!" squealed the gnome.
It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery
looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held
it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he
grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.
"This is what you have to do," he said. He raised the gnome above his
head ("Gerroff me!") and started to swing it in great circles like a
lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, "It doesn't
hurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find
their way back to the gnomeholes."
He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and
landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.
"Pitiful," said Fred. "I bet I can get mine beyond that stump."
Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided
just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome,
sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he
had a hard job shaking it off - until
"Wow, Harry - that must've been fifty feet ......
The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.
"See, they're not too bright," said George, seizing five or six gnomes at
once. "The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm
up to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay
put."
Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a
straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.
"They'll be back," said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into
the hedge on the other side of the field. "They love it here .... Dad's
too soft with them; he thinks they're funny . . . ."
Just then, the front door slammed.
"He's back!" said George. "Dad's home!"
They hurried through the garden and back into the house.
Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and
his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he
had was as red as any of his children's. He was wearing long green
robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.
"What a night," he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat
down around him. "Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher
tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ......
Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.
"Find anything, Dad?" said Fred eagerly.
"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle," yawned
Mr. Weasley. "There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my
department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about
some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental
Charms, thank goodness ......
"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?" said George.
"Just Muggle-baiting," sighed Mr. Weasley. "Sell them a key that
keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it
.... Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle
would admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keep
losing it. Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if
it's staring them in the face .... But the things our lot have taken to
enchanting, you wouldn't believe -"
"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?"
Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr.
Weasley's eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.
"C-cars, Molly, dear?"
"Yes, Arthur, cars," said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. "Imagine a
wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do
with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was
enchanting it to make it fly."
Mr. Weasley blinked.
"Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law to
do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his
wife the truth .... There's a loophole in the law, you'll find .... As long
as he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly
wouldn't -"
"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you
wrote that law!" shouted Mrs. Weasley. "Just so you could carry on
tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your
information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren't
intending to fly!"
"Harry?" said Mr. Weasley blankly. "Harry who?"
He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.
"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us
so much about -"
"Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night."
shouted Mrs. Weasley. "What have you got to say about that, eh?"
"Did you really?" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. "Did it go all right? I - I
mean," he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley's eyes, "that -
that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed ......
"Let's leave them to it," Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley
swelled like a bullfrog. "Come on, I'll show you my bedroom."
They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an
uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up
through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just
caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it
closed with a snap.
"Ginny," said Ron. "You don't know how weird it is for her to be this
shy. She never shuts up normally -"
They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling
paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD'S ROOM.
Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and
blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron's
room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the
walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered
nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same
seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying
broomsticks, and waving energetically.
"Your Quidditch team?" said Harry.
"The Chudley Cannons," said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread,
which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding
cannonball. "Ninth in the league."
Ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a
pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin
Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish
tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat,
Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun.
Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor
and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see
a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys'
hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost
nervously, as though waiting for his opinion.
"It's a bit small," said Ron quickly. "Not like that room you had
with the Muggles. And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic;
he's always banging on the pipes and groaning ......
But Harry, grinning widely, said, "This is the best house I've ever
been in."
Ron's ears went pink. .
C H A P T E R F O U R
AT F L 0 V R I S H AND BLOTTS
ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet
Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys'
house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the
first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it
shouted, "Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!" The ghoul in the attic howled
and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and
small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered
perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's,
however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the
fact that everybody there seemed to like him.
Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him
to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit
next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with
questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things
like plugs and the postal service worked.
"Fascinating." he would say as Harry talked him through using a
telephone. "Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of
getting along without magic."
Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he
had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table.
The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge
bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to
knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under
the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like
the setting sun. Pretending he hadn't noticed this, Harry sat down and
took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.
"Letters from school," said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron
identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.
"Dumbledore already knows you're here, Harry - doesn't miss a trick,
that man. You two've got them, too," he added, as Fred and George
ambled in, still in their pajamas.
For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters.
Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's
Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new
books he'd need for the coming year.
SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2
by Miranda Goshawk
Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart
Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart
Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart
Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart
Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart
Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart
Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart
Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry's.
"You've been told to get all Lockhart's books, too!" he said. "The new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it's a
witch."
At this point, Fred caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himself
with the marmalade.
"That lot won't come cheap," said George, with a quick look at his
parents. "Lockhart's books are really expensive ......
"Well, we'll manage," said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. "I
expect we'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny's things secondhand."
"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?" Harry asked Ginny.
She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her
elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry,
because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in. He was
already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater
vest.
"Morning, all," said Percy briskly. "Lovely day."
He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost
immediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, gray feather
duster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that
it was breathing.
"Errol!" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a
letter from under its wing. "Finally - he's got Hermione's answer. I
wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the
Dursleys."
He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to
stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on
the draining board instead, muttering, "Pathetic." Then he ripped
open Hermione's letter and read it out loud:
Ron, and Harry if you're there,
hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that
you didn't do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would
get Harry into trouble, too. I've been really worried and if Harry is all
right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet
ter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might
finish your one off.
"'I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'- How can she be?" said Ron
in horror. "We're on vacation! - 'and we're going to London next
Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don't we meet in Diago n Alley?
me know what's happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.
"'
"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,"
said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. "What're you all up to
today?"
Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a
small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that
blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could
practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high.
They couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to
explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead
they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding
Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom;
Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.
Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over
their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but
he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so
far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.
"Wish I knew what he was up to," said Fred, frowning. "He's not
himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve
O.WL.s and he hardly gloated at all."
"Ordinary Wizarding Levels," George explained, seeing Harry's
puzzled look. "Bill got twelve, too. If we're not careful, we'll have
another Head Boy in the family. I don't think I could stand the shame."
Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie,
had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but
knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt
working for the wizard's bank, Gringotts.
"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this
year," said George after a while. "Five sets of Lockhart books! And
Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything ......
Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground
vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had
left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had
money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts
in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account
to the Dursleys; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with
magic would stretch to a large pile of gold.
Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a
quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats
and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and
peered inside.
"We're running low, Arthur," she sighed. "We'll have to buy some
more today... Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!"
And she offered him the flowerpot.
Harry stared at them all watching him.
"W-what am I supposed to do?" he stammered.
"He's never traveled by Floo powder," said Ron suddenly. "Sorry,
Harry, I forgot."
"Never?" said Mr. Weasley. "But how did you get to Diagon Alley to
buy your school things last year?"
"I went on the Underground -"
"Really?" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. "Were there escapators? How
exactly -"
"Not now, Arthur," said Mrs. Weasley. "Floo powder's a lot quicker,
dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before -"
"He'll be all right, Mum," said Fred. "Harry, watch us first."
He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up
to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.
With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred,
who stepped right into it, shouted, "Diagon Alley!" and vanished.
"You must speak clearly, dear," Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George
dipped his hand into the flowerpot. "And be sure to get out at the right
grate ......
"The right what?" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped
George out of sight, too.
"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know,
but as long as you've spoken clearly -"
"He'll be fine, Molly, don't fuss," said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to
Floo powder, too.
"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and
uncle?"
"They wouldn't mind," Harry reassured her. "Dudley would think it
was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that -"
"Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur," said Mrs. Weasley. "Now,
when you get into the fire, say where you're going
"And keep your elbows tucked in," Ron advised.
"And your eyes shut," said Mrs. Weasley. "The soot -"
"Don't fidget," said Ron. "Or you might well fall out of the wrong
fireplace -"
"But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and
George."
Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder
and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered
the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a
warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot
of hot ash.
"D-Dia-gon Alley," he coughed.
It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed
to be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening -he
tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him
feel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in
tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands
were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred
stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his
bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again
wishing it would stop, and then
He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses
snap.
Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding
his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was -,cite alone, but where he
was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the
stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - but
nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.
A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained
pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down
from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter,
and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the
dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window
was definitely not Diagon Alley.
The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it
had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the
door, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on
the other side of the glass - and one of them was the
very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in
soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his
left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack
to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into
the shop.
The man who followed could only be Draco's father. He had the same
pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed
the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the
counter before turning to his son and saying, "Touch nothing, Draco."
Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, "I thought you were
going to buy me a present."
"I said I would buy you a racing broom," said his father, drumming his
fingers on the counter.
"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?" said Malfoy,
looking sulky and bad-tempered. "Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two
Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could
play for Gryffindor. He's not even that good, it's just because he's
famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead . . . ."
Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.
". . . everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and
his broomstick -"
"You have told me this at least a dozen times already," said Mr.
Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. "And I would remind you that it
is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when
most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord
disappear - ah, Mr. Borgin."
A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his
greasy hair back from his face.
"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again," said Mr. Borgin in a
voice as oily as his hair. "Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too -
charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today,
and very reasonably priced -"
"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling," said Mr. Malfoy.
"Selling?" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin's face.
"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more
raids," said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside
pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. "I have a few - ah -
items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call
......
Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the
list.
"The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?"
Mr. Malfoy's lip curled.
"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a
certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There
are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that fleabitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it
Harry felt a hot surge of anger.
"- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -"
"I understand, sir, of course," said Mr. Borgin. "Let me see. . ."
"Can I have that?" interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on
its cushion.
"Ah, the Hand of Glory!" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy's
list and scurrying over to Draco. "Insert a candle and it gives light only
to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine
taste, sir."
"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer,
Borgin," said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, "No
offense, sir, no offense meant -"
"Though if his grades don't pick up," said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still,
"that may indeed be all he is fit for -"
"It's not my fault," retorted Draco. "The teachers all have favorites,
that Hermione Granger -"
"I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family
beat you in every exam," snapped Mr. Malfoy.
"Ha!" said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both
abashed and angry.
"It's the same all over," said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. "Wizard
blood is counting for less everywhere -"
"Not with me," said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.
"No, sir, nor with me, sir," said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.
"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list," said Mr. Malfoy
shortly. "I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important
business elsewhere today -"
They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew
nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale.
Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read,
smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals,
Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle
Owners to Date.
Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He
walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle
"Done," said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. "Come, Draco -"
Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.
"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow
to pick up the goods."
The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.
"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you
haven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manor ......
Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry
waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could,
slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop
door.
Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had
emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of
shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he'd just left, Borgin and
Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window
display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was
alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were
watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other.
Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and
hoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here.
An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous
candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn't help, as Harry
had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn't spoken
clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes
back in the Weasleys' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to
do.
"Not lost are you, my dear?" said a voice in his ear, making him jump.
An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked
horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing
mossy teeth. Harry backed away.
"I'm fine, thanks," he said. "I'm just -"
"HARRY! What d'yeh think yer doin' down there?"
Harry's heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded
down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the
Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes
flashing over his great bristling beard.
"Hagrid!" Harry croaked in relief. "I was lost - Floo powder -"
Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away
from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks
followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright
sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the
distance - Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon
Alley.
"Yer a mess!" said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so
forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside
an apothecary. "Skulkin' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place,
Harry - don' want no one ter see yeh down there -"
"I realized that," said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off
again. "I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there,
anyway?"
"I was lookin' fer a Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent," growled Hagrid.
"They're ruinin' the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?"
"I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated," Harry explained.
"I've got to go and find them . . . ."
They set off together down the street.
"How come yeh never wrote back ter me?" said Hagrid as Harry
jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of
Hagrid's enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the
Dursleys.
"Lousy Muggles," growled Hagrid. "If I'd've known -"
"Harry! Harry! Over here!"
Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the
white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her
bushy brown hair flying behind her.
"What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid - Oh, it's wonderful to
see you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?"
"As soon as I've found the Weasleys," said Harry.
"Yeh won't have long ter wait," Hagrid said with a grin.
Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street
were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.
"Harry," Mr. Weasley panted. "We hoped you'd only gone one
grate too far . He mopped his glistening bald patch. "Molly's
frantic - she's coming now -"
"Where did you come out?" Ron asked.
"Knockturn Alley," said Hagrid grimly.
"Excellent." said Fred and George together.
"We've never been allowed in," said Ron enviously.
"I should ruddy well think not," growled Hagrid.
Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swing
ing wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.
"Oh, Harry - oh, my dear - you could have been any
where -"
Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her
bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn't managed to
beat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry's glasses, gave them a tap of his
wand, and returned them, good as new.
"Well, gotta be off," said Hagrid, who was having his hand
wrung by Mrs. Weasley ("Knockturn Alley! If you hadn't found
him, Hagrid!"). "See yer at Hogwarts!" And he strode away, head
and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.
"Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?" Harry asked Ron and
Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. "Malfoy and his fa
ther."
"Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?" said Mr. Weasley sharply
behind them.
"No, he was selling
"So he's worried," said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. "Oh,
I'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something ......
"You be careful, Arthur," said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were
bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. "That family's trou
ble. Don't go biting off more than you can chew -"
"So you don't think I'm a match for Lucius Malfoy?" said Mr.
Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the
sight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at the
counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for
Hermione to introduce them.
"But you're Muggles!" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. "We must have a drink!
What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly,
look!" He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Granger's hand.
"Meet you back here," Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry
were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.
The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped
along miniature train tracks through the bank's underground tunnels.
Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys' vault, but felt
dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened.
There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon.
Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into
her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to
block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a
leather bag.
Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered
vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their
friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to
a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers
off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.
"We'll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,"
said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. "And not one step down
Knockturn Alley!" she shouted at the twins' retreating backs.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street.
The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully
in Harry's pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three
large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped
happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating
shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Can
non robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until
Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door.
In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George,
and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous
Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of bro
ken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion
stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply
boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.
study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, " Ron read
aloud off the back cover. "That sounds fascinating . . . ."
"Go away," Percy snapped.
"'Course, he's very ambitious, Percy, he's got it all planned
out .... He wants to be Minister of Magic. . . " Ron told Harry
and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it.
An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by
no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they
approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out
side the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed
by a large banner stretched across the upper windows:
GILDEROY LOCKHART
will be signing copies of his autobiography
MAGICAL ME
today 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m.
"We can actually meet him!" Hermione squealed. "I mean, he's
written almost the whole booklist!"
The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs.
Weasley's age. A harrassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying,
"Calmly, please, ladies .... Don't push, there ... mind the books, now . .
. . "
Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound
right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing
his books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells,
Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys
were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.
"Oh, there you are, good," said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless
and kept patting her hair. "We'll be able to see him in a minute ......
Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded
by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly
white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of
forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard's
hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.
A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs
with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with
every blinding flash.
"Out of the way, there," he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better
shot. "This is for the Daily Prophet -"
"Big deal," said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had
stepped on it.
Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron
and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively
shouted, "It can't be Harry Potter?"
The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized
Harry's arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause.
Harry's face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who
was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys.
"Nice big smile, Harry," said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth.
"Together, you and I are worth the front page."
When he finally let go of Harry's hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers.
He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm
around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said loudly, waving for quiet. "What an
extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little
announcement I've been sitting on for some time!
"When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only
wanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present him
now, free of charge-" The crowd applauded again. "He had no idea,"
Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to
the end of his nose, "that he would shortly be getting much, much more
than my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting
the real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and
pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry!"
The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being
presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering
slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the
limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to
her new cauldron.
"You have these," Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the
cauldron. "I'll buy my own -"
"Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?" said a voice Harry had no
trouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face
with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.
"Famous Harry Potter," said Malfoy. "Can't even go into a bookshop
without making the front page."
"Leave him alone, he didn't want all that!" said Ginny. It was the first
time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.
"Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend!" drawled Malfoy. Ginny went
scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching
stacks of Lockhart's books.
"Oh, it's you," said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something
unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. "Bet you're surprised to see Harry
here, eh?"
"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley," retorted
Malfoy. "I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for
all those."
Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron,
too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the
back of his jacket.
"Ron!" said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George.
"What are you doing? It's too crowded in here, let's go outside."
"Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley."
It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco's shoulder,
sneering in just the same way.
"Lucius," said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.
"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear," said Mr. Malfoy. "All those raids
... I hope they're paying you overtime?"
He reached into Ginny's cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy
Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner's Guide
to Transfiguration.
"Obviously not," Mr. Malfoy said. "Dear me, what's the use of being a
disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?"
Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.
"We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,
Malfoy," he said.
"Clearly," said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs.
Granger, who were watching apprehensively. "The company you
keep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower
There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr.
Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward
into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down
on all their heads; there was a yell of, "Get him, Dad!" from Fred or
George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, "No, Arthur, no!"; the crowd
stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; "Gentlemen,
please - please!" cried the assistant, and then, louder than all
"Break it up, there, gents, break it up -"
Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he had
pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr.
Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still
holding Ginny's old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes
glittering with malice.
"Here, girl - take your book - it's the best your father can give you -" Pulling
himself out of Hagrid's grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.
"Yeh should've ignored him, Arthur," said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley
off his feet as he straightened his robes. "Rotten ter the core, the whole family,
everyone knows that - no Malfoy's worth listenin' ter - bad blood, that's what
it
is - come on now - let's get outta here."
The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely
came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the
street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with
fury.
"A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . . . what
Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought -"
"He was pleased," said Fred. "Didn't you hear him as we were leaving? He
was
asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight into
his report - said it was all publicity -"
But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky
Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be
traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the
Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side;
Mr. Weasley started to ask
them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs.
Weasley's face.
Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before
helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn't his favorite way to
travel.
C H A P T E RR F I V E
THE WHOMPING WILLOW
he end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry's liking.
He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month
at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to
feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of
welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.
On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner
that included all of Harry's favorite things, ending with a
mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the
evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they fiIled the kitchen
with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least
half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and
bed.
It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at
dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do.
Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and
quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast
in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a
stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny's trunk to the car.
Harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a
rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of
course, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.
"Not a word to Molly," he whispered to Harry as he opened the. trunk
and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the
luggage fitted easily.
When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the
back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting
comfortably side by side, and said, "Muggles do know more than we
give them credit for, don't they?" She and Ginny got into the front seat,
which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. "I mean,
you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?"
Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard,
Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to
wonder when he'd see it again when they were back George had
forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they
skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his
broomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginny
shrieked that she'd left her diary. By the time she had clambered back
into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running
high.
Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.
"Molly, dear -"
"No, Arthur -"
"No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I
installed - that'd get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds.
We'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -"
"I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight -"
They reached King's Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley
dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all
hurried into the station.
Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky
part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn't
visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the
solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn't hurt, but it had to
be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.
"Percy first," said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock
overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear
casually through the barrier.
Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next;
Fred and George followed.
"I'll take Ginny and you two come right after us," Mrs. Weasley told
Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off. In the blink of
an eye they were gone.
"Let's go together, we've only got a minute," Ron said to Harry.
Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of his
trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt
perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo
powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and
walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet
away from it, they broke into a run and
CRASH.
Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk fell
off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig's
cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking
indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled,
"What in blazes d'you think you're doing?"
"Lost control of the trolley," Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he
got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene
that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the
surrounding crowd.
"Why can't we get through?" Harry hissed to Ron.
"I dunno -"
Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still
watching them.
"We're going to miss the train," Ron whispered. "I don't understand
why the gateway's sealed itself -"
Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit
of his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine seconds ...
He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the
barrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.
Three seconds . . . two seconds ... one second ...
"It's gone," said Ron, sounding stunned. "The train's left. What if
Mum and Dad can't get back through to us? Have you got any
Muggle money?"
And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of
the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was
parked.
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and
got into the front.
"Check that no one's watching," said Ron, starting the ignition with
another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window:
Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was
empty.
"Okay," he said.
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around
them vanished - and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating
beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his
glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of
eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of
parked cars.
"Let's go," said Ron's voice from his right.
And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away,
dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London
lay, smoky and glittering, below them.
Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron
reappeared.
"Uh-oh," said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. "It's faulty -"
Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back
again.
"Hold on!" Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the acceler
ator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything
turned dull and foggy.
"Now what?" said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing
in on them from all sides.
"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in," said Ron.
"Dip back down again - quickly -"
They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their
seats, squinting at the ground.
"I can see it!" Harry yelled. "Right ahead - there!"
The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet
snake.
"Due north," said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard.
"Okay, we'll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on
And they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out
into a blaze of sunlight.
It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of
fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.
"All we've got to worry about now are airplanes," said Ron.
They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they
couldn't stop.
It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This,
thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and
turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat
pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing
Fred's and George's jealous faces when they
landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of
Hogwarts castle.
They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and
farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different
view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green
fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive
with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.
Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that
some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them
extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had
pulled off their sweaters, but Harry's T-shirt was sticking to the back
of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty
nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and
was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy
ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why
hadn't they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?
"Can't be much further, can it?" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the
sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink.
"Ready for another check on the train?"
It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped
mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds.
Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again,
but as he did so, the engine began to whine.
Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.
"It's probably just tired," said Ron. "It's never been this far before
...
And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing
louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were
blossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, try
ing to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving fee
bly, as though in protest.
"Not far," said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, "not far
now," and he patted the dashboard nervously.
When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they
had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew.
"There!" Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump.
"Straight ahead!"
Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake,
stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.
But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed.
"Come on," Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a lit
tle shake, "nearly there, come on -"
The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un
der the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat
very hard as they flew toward the lake.
The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry
saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below.
Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled
again.
"Come on," Ron muttered.
They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron
put his foot down.
There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died com
pletely.
"Uh-oh," said Ron, into the silence.
The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed,
heading straight for the solid castle wall.
"Noooooo!" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they
missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc,
soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then
out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.
Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of
his back pocket
"STOP! STOP!" he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the
windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward
them
"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!" Harry bellowed, lunging for the
steering wheel, but too late
CRUNCH.
With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree
trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was
billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in
terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry's head where he
had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing
groan.
"Are you okay?" Harry said urgently.
"My wand," said Ron, in a shaky voice. "Look at my wand -"
It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a
few splinters.
Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend it
up at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment,
something hit his side of the car with the force of a
charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an
equally heavy blow hit the roof.
"What's happen -?"
Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around
just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree
they had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and
its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could
reach.
"Aaargh!" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into
his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from
knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was
pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving
"Run for it!" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but
next second he had been knocked backward into Harry's lap by a
vicious uppercut from another branch.
"We're done for!" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the
floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted.
"Reverse!" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still
trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped
itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.
"That," panted Ron, "was close. Well done, car -"
The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp
clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next
thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told
him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig's
cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an
angry screech and sped off toward the castle
without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming,
the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.
"Come back!" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand.
"Dad'll kill me!"
But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its
exhaust.
"Can you believe our luck?" said Ron miserably, bending down to
pick up Scabbers. "Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get
one that hits back."
He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still
flailing its branches threateningly.
"Come on," said Harry wearily, "we'd better get up to the school
......
It wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold,
and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging
them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.
"I think the feast's already started," said Ron, dropping his trunk at
the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a
brightly lit window. "Hey - Harry - come and look - it's the Sorting!"
Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great
Hall.
Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long,
crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle.
Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky
outside, sparkled with stars.
Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long
line of scared-looking first years fiIing into the Hall. Ginny
was among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley ha-ir.
Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair
in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a
stool before the newcomers.
Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new
students into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,
Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on,
exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it
muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared
that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that had
turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but he had
ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the
Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the
House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven
years.
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the
hat on his head. Harry's eyes wandered past him to where Professor
Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff
table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the
candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart,
dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid,
huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.
"Hang on. . . " Harry muttered to Ron. "There's an empty chair at the
staff table .... Where's Snape?"
Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher. Harry
also happened to be Snape's least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic,
and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house
(Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.
"Maybe he's ill!" said Ron hopefully.
"Maybe he's left," said Ha-rry, "because he missed out on the Defense
Against Dark Arts job again!"
"Or he might have been sacked!" said Ron enthusiastically. "I mean,
everyone hates him -"
"Or maybe," said a very cold voice right behind them, "he's waiting to
hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train."
Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze,
stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked
nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he
was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep
trouble.
"Follow me," said Snape.
Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape
up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with
flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great
Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a
narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.
"In!" he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and
pointing.
They entered Snape's office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined
with shelves of large glass) ars, in which floated all manner of
revolting things Harry didn't really want to know the name of at the
moment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the door
and turned to look at them.
"So," he said softly, "the train isn't good enough for the famous Harry
Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang,
did we, boys?"
"No, sir, it was the barrier at King's Cross, it -
"Silence!" said Snape coldly. "What have you done with the
car?"
Ron gulped. This wasn't the first time Snape had given Harry the
impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he un
derstood, as Snape unrolled today's issue of the Evening Prophet.
"You were seen," he hissed, showing them the headline: FLY
ING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read
aloud: "Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car
flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs.
Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet,
of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. I be
lieve your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?"
he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. "Dear,
dear ... his own son. . . "
Harry felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach by
one of the mad tree's larger branches. If anyone found out Mr.
Weasley had bewitched the car ... he hadn't thought of that ....
"I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage
seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,"
Snape went on.
"That tree did more damage to us than we -" Ron blurted out.
"Silence!" snapped Snape again. "Most unfortunately, you are
not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with
me. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power.
You will wait here."
Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn't
feel hungry any more. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to
look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a
shelf behind Snape's desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor
McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better
off. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict.
Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor
McGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor
McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten
just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry
before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron
both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where
flames suddenly erupted.
"Sit," she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.
"Explain," she said, her glasses glinting ominously.
Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station
refusing to let them through.
"
-so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn't get on the train."
"Why didn't you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?"
Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.
Harry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to
have done.
"I - I didn't think -"
"That," said Professor McGonagall, "is obvious."
There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier
than ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor
Dumbledore.
Harry's whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually
grave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and
Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being
beaten up by the Whomping Willow.
There was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, "Please explain why
you did this."
It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the
disappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look
Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told
Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the
bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to
find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore
would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions
about the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer
at them through his spectacles.
"We'll go and get our stuff," said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.
"What are you talking about, Weasley?" barked Professor
McGonagall.
"Well, you're expelling us, aren't you?" said Ron.
Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore.
"Not today, Mr. Weasley," said Dumbledore. "But I must impress upon
both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to
both your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything
like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you."
Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his
throat and said, "Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the
Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious
damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature -"
"It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys'
punishments, Severus," said Dumbledore calmly. "They are in her
House and are therefore her responsibility." He turned to Professor
McGonagall. "I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give
out a few notices. Come, Severus, there's a delicious-looking cus
tard tart I want to sample -"
Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed
himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Pro
fessor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.
"You'd better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you're
bleeding."
"Not much," said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with
his sleeve. "Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -"
"The Sorting Ceremony is over," said Professor McGonagall.
"Your sister is also in Gryffindor."
"Oh, good," said Ron.
"And speaking of Gryffindor -" Professor McGonagall said
sharply, but Harry cut in: "Professor, when we took the car, term
hadn't started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn't really have points
taken from it - should it?" he finished, watching her anxiously.
Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure
she had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.
"I will not take any points from Gryffindor," she said, and
Harry's heart lightened considerably. "But you will both get a de
tention."
It was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore's
writing to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly
well they'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn't
squashed him flat.
Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape's
desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of-iced
pumpkin juice appeared with a pop.
"You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory," she
said. "I must also return to the feast."
When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.
"I thought we'd had it," he said, grabbing a sandwich.
"So did I," said Harry, taking one, too.
"Can you believe our luck, though?" said Ron thickly through a
mouthful of chicken and ham. "Fred and George must've flown that
car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them." He swallowed
and took another huge bite. "Why couldn't we get through the barrier?"
Harry shrugged. "We'll have to watch our step from now on, though,"
he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. "Wish we could've
gone up to the feast ......
"She didn't want us showing off," said Ron sagely. "Doesn't want
people to think it's clever, arriving by flying car."
When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate
kept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar
path to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the
feast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking
suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last
they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor
Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a
pink silk dress.
"Password?" she said as they approached.
"Er -" said Harry.
They didn't know the new year's password, not having met a
Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard
hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward
them.
"There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors -
someone said you'd been expelled for crashing a flying car
"Well, we haven't been expelled," Harry assured her.
"You're not telling me you did fly here?" said Hermione, sounding
almost as severe as Professor McGonagall.
"Skip the lecture," said Ron impatiently, "and tell us the new
password."
"It's said Hermione impatiently, "but that's not the point -
"
Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady
swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as
though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into
the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and
squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through
the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to
scramble in after then-t.
"Brilliant!" yelled Lee Jordan. "Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a
car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that
one for years -"
"Good for you," said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone
was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon;
Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said
together, "Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?"
Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could
see one person who didn't look happy at all. Percy was visible over
the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to
get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the
ribs and nodded in Percy's direction. Ron got the point at once.
"Got to get upstairs - bit tired," he said, and the two of them started
pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room,
which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.
"'Night," Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl
just like Percy's.
They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still
having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase.
They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of
their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS.
They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters
hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had
been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.
Ron grinned guiltily at Harry.
"I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but
The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year
Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville
Longbottom.
"Unbelievable!" beamed Seamus.
"Cool," said Dean.
"Amazing," said Neville, awestruck.
Harry couldn't help it. He grinned, too.
C H A P T E R SIX
GILDEROY LOCKHART
he next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go
downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables
were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of
toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling
(today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor
table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires
propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the
way she said "Morning," which told Harry that she was still
disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the
other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and
accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever
met.
"Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot."
Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was
a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls
streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the
chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's head
and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug,
spraying them all with milk and feathers.
"Enrol!" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol
slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red
envelope in his beak.
"Oh, no -" Ron gasped.
"It's all right, he's still alive," said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with
the tip of her finger.
"It's not that - it's that."
Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to
Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they
expected it to explode.
"What's the matter?" said Harry.
"She's - she's sent me a Howler," said Ron faintly.
"You'd better open it, Ron," said Neville in a timid whisper. "It'll be
worse if you don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and" -
he gulped - "it was horrible."
Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.
"What's a Howler?" he said.
But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to
smoke at the corners.
"Open it," Neville urged. "It'll all be over in a few minutes -"
Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol's
beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split
second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had
exploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the
ceiling.
"THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURSTEALING THE
PRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET
HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO
THINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN
WE SAW IT WAS GONE -"
Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the
plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the
stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see
who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that
only his crimson forehead could be seen.
"- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT
YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING
YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD
BOTH HAVE DIED -"
Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He
tried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that was
making his eardrums throb.
"-ABSOLUTELYDISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN
INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF
YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU
STRAIGHT BACK HOME."
A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's
hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat
stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few
people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.
Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top
of Ron's head.
"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you -"
"Don't tell me I deserved it," snapped Ron.
Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt.
Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley had done for him over the summer ...
But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was
moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules.
Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the
Hufepuffs first.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the
vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical
plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing:
Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and
was being perfectly friendly again.
As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class
standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view
across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor
Sprout's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt,
Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its
branches now in slings.
Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over
her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her
clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint.
Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of
turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise
hat with gold trimming.
"Oh, hello there!" he called, beaming around at the assembled
students. "Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor
a Whomping Willow! But I don't want you running away with the idea
that I'm better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met
several of these exotic plants on my travels . . ."
"Greenhouse three today, chaps!" said Professor Sprout, who was
looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.
There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in
greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting
and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt
and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and
fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrellasized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron
and Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out.
"Harry! I've been wanting a word - you don't mind if he's a couple of
minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?"
Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said,
"That's the ticket," and closed the greenhouse door in her face.
"Harry," said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight
as he shook his head. "Harry, Harry, Harry."
Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.
"When I heard -well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked
myself."
Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so
when Lockhart went on, "Don't know when I've been more shocked.
Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you'd
done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry."
It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant
teeth even when he wasn't talking.
"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I?" said Lockhart. "Gave
you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and
you couldn't wait to do it again."
"Oh, no, Professor, see -"
"Harry, Harry, Harry," said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping
his shoulder. "I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you've
had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, be
cause it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man,
you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm
down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you're older. Yes,
yes, I know what you're thinking! 'It's all right for him, he's an in
ternationally famous wizard already!' But when I was twelve, I was
just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, Id say I was even
more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven't
they? All that business with He
glanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead. "I know, I
know - it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's Most
Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it's a
start, Harry, it's a start."
He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood
stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to
be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside.
Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen
ter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear
muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place
between Ron and Hermione, she said, "We'll be repotting Man
drakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Man
drake?"
To nobody's surprise, Hermione's hand was first into the air.
"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative," said Hermione,
sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. "It is
used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their
original state."
"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor," said Professor Sprout. "The
Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also,
however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?"
Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again.
"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it," she said
promptly.
"Precisely. Take another ten points," said Professor Sprout. "Now, the
Mandrakes we have here are still very young."
She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone
shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants,
purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite
unremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea what
Hermione meant by the "cry" of the Mandrake.
"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs," said Professor Sprout.
There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn't
pink and fluffy.
"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely
covered," said Professor Sprout. "When it is safe to remove them, I
will give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on."
Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound
completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own
ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants
firmly, and pulled hard.
Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.
Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out
of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had
pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his
lungs.
Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and
plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until
only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her
hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.
"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet," she
said calmly as though she'd just done nothing more exciting than water
a begonia. "However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as
I'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your
earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your
attention when it is time to pack up.
"Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the
sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it's
teething."
She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making
it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her
shoulder.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired
Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.
"Justin Finch-Fletchley," he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand.
"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter... And you're
Hermione Granger - always top in everything"
(Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) "- and Ron
Weasley. Wasn't that your flying car?"
Ron didn't smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.
"That Lockhart's something, isn't he?" said Justin happily as they
began fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. "Awfully
brave chap. Have you read his books? Id have died of fear if Id been
cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and -
zap - just fantastic.
"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad I
am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed,
but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to see
how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . ."
After that they didn't have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were
back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor
Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't. The Mandrakes
didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back
into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and
gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a
particularly fat one into a pot.
By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty,
aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for
a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.
Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but today
was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year
seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was
supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed
to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the
desktop avoiding his wand.
Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand
with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond
repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time
Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke
that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron
accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a
new one. Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased.
Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung
sponge. Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who
was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.
"Stupid - useless - thing -"
"Write home for another one," Harry suggested as the wand let off a
volley of bangs like a firecracker.
"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back," said Ron, stuffing the now
hissing wand into his bag. " your own fault your wand got snapped -
'"
They went down to lunch, where Ron's mood was not improved by
Hermione's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had
produced in Transfiguration.
"What've we got this afternoon?" said Harry, hastily changing the
subject.
"Defense Against the Dark Arts," said Hermione at once.
"Why, "demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, "have you outlined all
Lockhart's lessons in little hearts?"
Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.
They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard.
Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages
with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for
several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely
watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd
seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though
transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle
camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red.
"All right, Harry? I'm -I'm Colin Creevey," he said breathlessly, taking
a tentative step forward. "I'm in Gryffindor, too. D'you think - would it
be all right if - can I have a picture?" he said, raising the camera
hopefully.
"A picture?" Harry repeated blankly.
"So I can prove I've met you," said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging
further forward. "I know all about you. Everyone's told me. About
how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he
disappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar on
your forehead" (his eyes raked Harry's hairline) "and a boy in my
dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'll
move." Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said,
"It's amazing here, isn't it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do
was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad's a milkman, he
couldn't believe it either. So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home
to him. And it'd be really good if I had one of you" - he looked
imploringly at Harry - "maybe your friend could take it and I could
stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?"
"Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, Potter?"
Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy's voice echoed around the
courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always
was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and
Goyle.
"Everyone line up!" Malfoy roared to the crowd. "Harry Potter's
giving out signed photos!"
"No, I'm not," said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. "Shut up,
Malfoy."
"You're just jealous," piped up Colin, whose entire body was about
as thick as Crabbe's neck.
Malfoy, who didn't need to shout anymore: half the
courtyard was listening in. "Of what? I don't want a foul scar right
across my head, thanks. I don't think getting your head cut open
makes you that special, myself."
Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.
"Eat slugs, Malfoy," said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and
started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.
"Be careful, Weasley," sneered Malfoy. "You don't want to start any
trouble or your Mommy'll have to come and take you away from
school." He put on a shrill, piercing voice. "Ifyou put another toe
out of line' - "
A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this.
"Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter," smirked Malfoy. "It'd
be worth more than his family's whole house -"
Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages
with Vampires with a snap and whispered, "Look out!"
"What's all this, what's all this?" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding
toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. "Who's giv
ing out signed photos?"
Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an
arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, "Shouldn't have
asked! We meet again, Harry!"
Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, Harry
saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd.
"Come on then, Mr. Creevey," said Lockhart, beaming at Colin.
"A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign it
for you."
Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell
rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.
"Off you go, move along there," Lockhart called to the crowd,
and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he
knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.
"A word to the wise, Harry," said Lockhart paternally as they
entered the building through a side door. "I covered up for you
back there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me,
too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so
much . . . ."
Deaf to Harry's stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor
lined with staring students and up a staircase.
"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of
your career isn't sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be
frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you'll need to
keep a stack handy wherever you go, but" - he gave a little chor
tle - "I don't think you're quite there yet."
They had reached Lockhart's classroom and he let Harry go at
last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very
back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of
Lockhart's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the
real thing.
The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat
down on either side of Harry.
"You could've fried an egg on your face" said Ron. "You'd better hope
Creevey doesn't meet Ginny, or they'll be starting a Harry Potter fan
club."
"Shut up," snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart
to hear the phrase "Harry Potter fan club."
When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly
and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom's
copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking
portrait on the front.
"Me," he said, pointing at it and winking as well. "Gilderoy Lockhart,
Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force
Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's MostCharming-Smile Award - but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of
the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!"
He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.
"I see you've all bought a complete set of my books -well done. I
thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about
just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -"
When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of
the class and said, "You have thirty minutes - start - now!"
Harry looked down at his paper and read:
1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart 's favorite color?
2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition?
3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest
achievement to date?
On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:
54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday, and what would his
ideal gift be?
Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through
them in front of the class.
"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is
lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read
Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter
twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all
magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a large
bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!"
He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at
Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus
Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking
with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to
Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her
name.
". . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the
world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good
girl! In fact" - he flipped her paper over - "full marks! Where is Miss
Hermione Granger?"
Hermione raised a trembling hand.
"Excellent!" beamed Lockhart. "Quite excellent! Take ten points for
Gryffindor! And so - to business -"
He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.
"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your
worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst
I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm."
In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better
look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and
Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front
row seat.
"I must ask you not to scream," said Lockhart in a low voice. "It might
provoke them."
As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover.
"Yes," he said dramatically. "Freshly caught Cornish pixies. "
Seamus Finnigan couldn't control himself. He let out a snort of
laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror.
"Yes?" He smiled at Seamus.
"Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous, are they?" Seamus
choked.
"Don't be so sure!" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at
Seamus. "Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!"
The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed
faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies
arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they had started jabbering
and rocketing around, rattling the bars and
making bizarre faces at the people nearest them.
"Right, then," Lockhart said loudly. "Let's see what you make of
them!" And he opened the cage.
It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.
Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air.
Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row
with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more
effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and
sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures
from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books
and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the
class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the
iron chandelier in the ceiling.
"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,"
Lockhart shouted.
He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,
"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!"
It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and
threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his
own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a
second later as the chandelier gave way.
The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative
calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry,
Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, "Well, I'll
ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage." He
swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.
"Can you believe him?" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit
him painfully on the ear.
"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience," said Hermione,
immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and
stuffing them back into their cage.
"Hands on? "said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of
reach with its tongue out. "Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he
was doing -"
"Rubbish," said Hermione. "You've read his books - look at all those
amazing things he's done -"
"He says he's done," Ron muttered.
arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight
whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder
to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's
schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, "All
right, Harry?" six or seven times a day and hear, "Hello, Colin," back,
however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.
Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey
and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday
morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old
Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large,
throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and
another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and
Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry,
however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by
Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor
Quidditch team.
"Whassamatter?" said Harry groggily.
"Quidditch practice!" said Wood. "Come on!"
Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across
the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn't
understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were
making.
"Oliver," Harry croaked. "It's the crack of dawn."
"Exactly," said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the
moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. "It's part
of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,"
said Wood heartily. "None of the other teams have started training yet;
we're going to be first off the mark this year -"
Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to
find his Quidditch robes.
"Good man," said Wood. "Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.
When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for
warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and
went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two
Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when
there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down
the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and
something clutched in his hand.
"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what
I've got here! I've had it developed, I wanted to show you -"
Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing
under his nose.
A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm
Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his
photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be
dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and
slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture.
"Will you sign it?" said Colin eagerly.
"No," said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was
really deserted. "Sorry, Colin, I'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice -"
He climbed through the portrait hole.
"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I've never watched a Quidditch game
before!"
Colin scrambled through the hole after him.
"It'll be really boring," Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his
face shining with excitement.
"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren't
you, Harry? Weren't you?" said Colin, trotting alongside him. "You
must be brilliant. I've never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own
broom? Is that the best one there is?"
Harry didn't know how to get rid of him. It was like having an
extremely talkative shadow.
"I don't really understand Quidditch," said Colin breathlessly. "Is it
true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock
people off their brooms?"
"Yes," said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated
rules of Quidditch. "They're called Bludgers. There are two Beaters
on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their
side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters."
"And what are the other balls for?" Colin asked, tripping down a
couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.
"Well, the Quafe - that's the biggish red one - is the one that scores
goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other
and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch -
they're three long poles with hoops on the end."
"And the fourth ball -"
"- is the Golden Snitch," said Harry, "and it's very small, very fast, and
difficult to catch. But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a
game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. And
whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra
hundred and fifty points."
"And you're the Gryffindor Seeker, aren't you?" said Colin in awe.
"Yes," said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenched grass. "And there's the Keeper, too. He guards the goal
posts. That's it, really."
But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping
lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he
reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice,
"I'll go and get a good seat, Harry!" and hurried off to the stands.
The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room.
Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George
Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year
Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind
her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side
by side opposite them.
"There you are, Harry, what kept you?" said Wood briskly. "Now, I
wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field,
because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program,
which I really think will make all the difference ....
Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which
were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks.
He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to
wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a
speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped right
onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore.
The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was
another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into
a stupor as Wood droned on and on.
"So," said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy
about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up
at the castle. "Is that clear? Any questions?"
"I've got a question, Oliver," said George, who had woken with a
start. "Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we
were awake?"
Wood wasn't pleased.
"Now, listen here, you lot," he said, glowering at them all. "We
should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We're easily the best
team. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control -
"
Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the
hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that
Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst
defeat in three hundred years.
Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat
was clearly still torturing him.
"So this year, we train harder than ever before .... Okay, let's go and
put our new theories into practice!" Wood shouted, seizing his
broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stifflegged
and still yawning, his team followed.
They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up
completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the
stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione
sitting in the stands.
"Aren't you finished yet?" called Ron incredulously.
"Haven't even started," said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and
marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall.
"Wood's been teaching us new moves."
He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into
the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more
effectively than Wood's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the
Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed,
racing Fred and George.
"What's that funny clicking noise?" called Fred as they hurtled around
the corner.
Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest
seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound
strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.
"Look this way, Harry! This way!" he cried shrilly.
"Who's that?" said Fred.
"No idea," Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far
away as possible from Colin.
"What's going on?" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the
air toward them. "Why's that first year taking pictures? I don't like it.
He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training
program."
"He's in Gryffindor," said Harry quickly.
"And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver," said George.
"What makes you say that?" said Wood testily.
"Because they're here in person," said George, pointing.
Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks
in their hands.
"I don't believe it!" Wood hissed in outrage. "I booked the field for
today! We'll see about this!"
Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to
in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and
George followed.
"Flint!" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. "This is our practice
time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!"
Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish
cunning on his face as he replied, "Plenty of room for all of us, Wood."
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls
on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the
Gryffindors, leering to a man.
"But I booked the field!" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. "I
booked it!"
"Ah," said Flint. "But I've got a specially signed note here from
Professor Snape. Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team
permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to
train their new Seeker."'
"You've got a new Seeker?" said Wood, distracted. "Where?"
And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh,
smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco
Malfoy.
"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with
dislike.
"Funny you should mention Draco's father," said Flint as the whole
Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. "Let me show you the
generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team."
All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished,
brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the
words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors'
noses in the early morning sun.
"Very latest model. Only came out last month," said Flint carelessly,
flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. "I believe it outstrips
the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old
Cleansweeps" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both
clutching Cleansweep Fives - "sweeps the board with them."
None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a
moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced
to slits.
"Oh, look," said Flint. "A field invasion."
Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.
"What's happening?" Ron asked Harry. "Why aren't you playing? And
what's he doing here?"
He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.
"I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley," said Malfoy, smugly.
"Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought our
team.
Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of
him.
"Good, aren't they?" said Malfoy smoothly. "But perhaps the
Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms,
too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum
would bid for them."
The Slytherin team howled with laughter.
"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in," said
Hermione sharply. "They got in on pure talent."
The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered.
"No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood," he spat.
Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad
because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in
front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia
shrieked, "How dare you!" ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes,
pulled out his wand, yelling, "You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!" and
pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoys face.
A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot
out of the wrong end of Ron's wand, hitting him in the stomach and
sending him reeling backward onto the grass.
"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?" squealed Hermione.
Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he
gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth
onto his lap.
The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled
up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all
fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were
gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs.
Nobody seemed to want to touch him.
"We'd better get him to Hagrid's, it's nearest," said Harry to
Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up
by the arms.
"What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can
cure him, can't you?" Colin had run down from his seat and was now
dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave
and more slugs dribbled down his front.
"Oooh," said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. "Can you hold
him still, Harry?"
"Get out of the way, Colin!" said Harry angrily. He and Hermione
supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward
the edge of the forest.
"Nearly there, Ron," said Hermione as the gamekeeper's cabin came
into view. "You'll be all right in a minute - almost there -"
They were within twenty feet of Hagrid's house when the front door
opened, but it wasn't Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart,
wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.
"Quick, behind here," Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby
bush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.
"It's a simple matter if you know what you're doing!" Lockhart was
saying loudly to Hagrid. "If you need help, you know where I am! I'll
let you have a copy of my book. I'm surprised you haven't already got
one - I'll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!" And he
strode away toward the castle.
Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of
the bush and up to Hagrid's front door. They knocked urgently.
Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression
brightened when he saw who it was.
"Bin wonderin' when you'd come ter see me - come in, come in -
thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again -"
Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the oneroomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire
crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn't seem perturbed by Ron's
slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a
chair.
"Better out than in," he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in
front of him. "Get 'em all up, Ron."
"I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop," said
Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. "That's a
difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand -"
Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang,
was slobbering over Harry.
"What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?" Harry asked, scratching
Fang's ears.
"Givin' me advice on gettin' kelpies out of a well," growled
Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and
setting down the teapot. "Like I don' know. An' bangin' on about
some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I'll eat my
kettle."
It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts' teacher, and Harry
looked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice
somewhat higher than usual, "I think you're being a bit unfair.
Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for
the job -"
"He was the on' man for the job," said Hagrid, offering them a Y
plate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin.
"An' I mean the on' one. Gettin' very difficult ter find anyone fer Y
the Dark Arts job. People aren't too keen ter take it on, see. They're
startin' ter think it's jinxed. No one's lasted long fer a while now. So
tell me," said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. "Who was he tryin' ter
curse?"
"Malfoy called Hermione something - it must've been really bad,
because everyone went wild."
"It was bad," said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking
pale and sweaty. "Malfoy called her Hagrid -"
Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their
appearance. Hagrid looked outraged.
"He didn'!" he growled at Hermione.
"He did," she said. "But I don't know what it means. I could tell it
was really rude, of course -"
"It's about the most insulting thing he could think of," gasped Ron,
coming back up. "Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is
Muggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards - like
Malfoy's family - who think they're better than
everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood." He
gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He
threw it into the basin and continued, "I mean, the rest of us know it
doesn't make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom -
he's pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way
up."
"An' they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can' do," said Hagrid
proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.
"It's a disgusting thing to call someone," said Ron, wiping his sweaty
brow with a shaking hand. "Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It's
ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we
hadn't married Muggles we'd've died out."
He retched and ducked out of sight again.
"Well, I don' blame yeh fer tryin' ter curse him, Ron," said Hagrid
loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. "Bu' maybe it
was a good thing yer wand backfired. 'Spect Lucius Malfoy
would've come marchin' up ter school if yeh'd cursed his son. Least
yer not in trouble."
Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worse
than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn't; Hagrid's
treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together.
"Harry," said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.
"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I've heard you've bin givin' out signed
photos. How come I haven't got one?"
Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.
"I have not been giving out signed photos," he said hotly. "If
Lockhart's still spreading that around -"
But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.
"I'm on'y jokin'," he said, patting Harry genially on the back and
sending him face first into the table. "I knew yeh hadn't really. I told
Lockhart yeh didn' need teh. Yer more famous than him without
tryin'."
"Bet he didn't like that," said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.
"Don' think he did," said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. "An' then I told
him Id never read one o' his books an' he decided ter go. Treacle
fudge, Ron?" he added as Ron reappeared.
"No thanks," said Ron weakly. "Better not risk it."
"Come an' see what I've bin growin'," said Hagrid as Harry and
Hermione finished the last of their tea.
In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid's house were a dozen of
the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a
large boulder.
"Gettin' on well, aren't they?" said Hagrid happily. "Fer the Halloween
feast ... should be big enough by then."
"What've you been feeding them?" said Harry.
Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.
"Well, I've bin givin' them - you know - a bit o' help -"
Harry noticed Hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back
wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that
this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong
impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it.
Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from
Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why -any
mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his
throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was
changed.
"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?" said Hermione, halfway
between disapproval and amusement. "Well, you've done a good job on
them."
"That's what yer little sister said," said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. "Met
her jus' yesterday." Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard
twitching. "Said she was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but I reckon
she was hopin' she might run inter someone else at my house." He
winked at Harry. "If yeh ask me, she wouldn' say no ter a signed -"
"Oh, shut up," said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground
was sprayed with slugs.
"Watch it!" Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious
pumpkins.
It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle
fudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said
good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing
occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.
They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang
out, "There you are, Potter - Weasley." Professor McGonagall was
walking toward them, looking stern. "You will both do your detentions
this evening."
"What're we doing, Professor?" said Ron, nervously suppressing a
burp.
"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,"
said Professor McGonagall. "And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease."
Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student
in the school.
"And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan
mail," said Professor McGonagall.
"Oh n - Professor, can't I go and do the trophy room, too?" said Harry
desperately.
"Certainly not," said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows.
"Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o'clock sharp,
both of you."
Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest
gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-schoolrules sort of expression. Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as
much as he'd thought. Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal.
"Filch'll have me there all night," said Ron heavily. "No magic! There
must be about a hundred cups in that room. I'm no good at Muggle
cleaning."
"I'd swap anytime," said Harry hollowly. "I've had loads of practice
with the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart's fan mail ... he'll be a
nightmare ......
Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no
time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet
along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart's office. He gritted his
teeth and knocked.
The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him.
"Ah, here's the scalawag!" he said. "Come in, Harry, come in -"
Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were
countless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few
of them. Another large pile lay on his desk.
"You can address the envelopes!" Lockhart told Harry, as though
this was a huge treat. "This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her -
huge fan of mine -"
The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart's voice wash over him,
occasionally saying, "Mmm" and "Right" and "Yeah." Now and then
he caught a phrase like, "Fame's a fickle friend, Harry," or "Celebrity
is as celebrity does, remember that."
The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the
many moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his
aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out
Veronica Smethley's address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry
thought miserably, please let it be nearly time...
And then he heard something - something quite apart from the
spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart's prattle about his fans.
It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of
breathtaking, ice-cold venom.
"Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you"
Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica
Smethley's street.
"What?" he said loudly.
"I know!" said Lockhart. "Six solid months at the top of the bestseller list! Broke all records!"
"No," said Harry frantically. "That voice!"
"Sorry?" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. "What voice?"
"That - that voice that said - didn't you hear it?"
Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.
"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you're getting a litde
drowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We've been here nearly four
hours! Id never have believed it - the time's flown, hasn't it?"
Harry didn't answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again,
but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn't
expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed,
Harry left.
It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty.
Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn't back yet. Harry
pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron
arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into
the darkened room.
"My muscles have all seized up," he groaned, sinking on his bed.
"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was
satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award
for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How was
it with Lockhart?"
Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus,
Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard.
"And Lockhart said he couldn't hear it?" said Ron. Harry could see
him frowning in the moonlight. "D'you think he was lying? But I don't
get it - even someone invisible would've had to open the door."
"I know," said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the
canopy above him. "I don't get it either."
October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle.
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among
the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left
the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley,
who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The
steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole
head was on fire.
Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on
end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's
pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for
regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry
was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before
Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and
splattered with mud..
Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session.
Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for
themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They
reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs,
shooting through the air like missiles.
As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody
who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost
of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering
under his breath, ". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that .
. ."
"Hello, Nick," said Harry.
"Hello, hello," said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He
wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff,
which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He
was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky
and torrential rain outside.
"You look troubled, young Potter," said Nick, folding a transparent letter as
he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.
"So do you," said Harry.
"Ah," Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, "a matter of no
importance. . . . It's not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I'd
apply, but apparently I 'don't fulfill requirements' -"
In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.
"But you would think, wouldn't you," he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter
back out of his pocket, "that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a
blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?"
"Oh - yes," said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.
"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean,
and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great
deal of pain and ridicule. However -" Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter
open and read furiously: "'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have
parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be
impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as
Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret,
therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements.
With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.'"
Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.
"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people
would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir
Properly Decapitated-Podmore."
Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far
calmer tone, "So - what's bothering you? Anything I can do?"
"No," said Harry. "Not unless you know where we can get seven free
Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -"
The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling
from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing
into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat
who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his
endless battle against students.
"You'd better get out of here, Harry," said Nick quickly. "Filch isn't in a
good mood - he's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog
brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He's been cleaning all morning,
and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -"
"Right," said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris,
but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that
seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through
a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rulebreaker.
There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose
was unusually purple.
"Filth!" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he
pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes.
"Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me,
Potter!"
So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed
Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the
floor.
Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place most
students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil
lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about
the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels,
Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever
punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A
highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind
Filch's desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging
Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.
Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around
looking for parchment.
"Dung," he muttered furiously, "great sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains
. . . rat intestines . . . I've had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where's
the form . . . yes . . ."
He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it
out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.
"Name . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . ."
"It was only a bit of mud!" said Harry.
"It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!"
shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose.
"Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . ."
Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who
waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.
But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of
the office, which made the oil lamp rattle.
"PEEVES!" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. "I'll
have you this time, I'll have you!"
And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the
office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.
Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to
cause havoc and distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help
feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it
sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would
distract Filch from Harry.
Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank
into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart
from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver
lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch
wasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A
Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic.
Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of
parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out
of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to
perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There
is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn
course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell
method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: "I had no memory for
incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell
course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of
my Scintillation Solution!" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: "My wife
used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous
Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you,
Kwikspell!"
Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Why
on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn't a
proper wizard? Harry was just reading "Lesson One: Holding Your Wand
(Some Useful Tips)" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was
coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it
back onto the desk just as the door opened.
Filch was looking triumphant.
"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!" he was saying gleefully to
Mrs. Norris. "We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -"
His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which,
Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.
Filch's pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of
fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it
into a drawer.
"Have you - did you read -?" he sputtered.
"No," Harry lied quickly.
Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together.
"If I thought you'd read my private - not that it's mine - for a friend - be that
as it may - however -"
Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes
were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan
scarf didn't help.
"Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn't
read - go now, I have to write up Peeves' report - go -"
Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back
upstairs. To escape from Filch's office without punishment was probably
some kind of school record.
"Harry! Harry! Did it work?"
Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry
could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to
have been dropped from a great height.
"I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office," said Nick eagerly.
"Thought it might distract him -"
"Was that you?" said Harry gratefully. "Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get
detention. Thanks, Nick!"
They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed,
was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter..
"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,"
Harry said.
Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through
him. He wished he hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower.
"But there is something you could do for me," said Nick excitedly. "Harry -
would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want -"
"What is it?" said Harry.
"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday," said Nearly
Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.
"Oh," said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this.
"Right."
"I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be
coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would
attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of
course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?" He watched Harry
on tenterhooks.
"No," said Harry quickly, "I'll come -"
"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And" - he hesitated,
looking excited - "do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick
how very frightening and impressive you find me?"
"Of - of course," said Harry.
Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. "A deathday party?" said Hermione
keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the
common room. "I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've
been to one of those - it'll be fascinating!".
"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?" said Ron, who
was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. "Sounds dead
depressing to me. . . ."
Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside
all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless
squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in
the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen
if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had "rescued" the
brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class
and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of
curious people.
Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the
Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air,
emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The
sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular
display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its
escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the
Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived,
Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of
the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had
been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been
carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were
rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the
entertainment.
"A promise is a promise," Hermione reminded Harry bossily. "You said
you'd go to the deathday party."
So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the
doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold
plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.
The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined
with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long,
thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light
even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step
they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he
heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous
blackboard.
"Is that supposed to be music?" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and
saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet
drapes.
"My dear friends," he said mournfully. "Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased
you could come. . . ."
He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.
It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white,
translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor,
waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by
an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead
blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose
in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.
"Shall we have a look around?" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his
feet.
"Careful not to walk through anyone," said Ron nervously, and they set off
around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a
ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost,
who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry
wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin
ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the
other ghosts.
"Oh, no," said Hermione, stopping abruptly. "Turn back, turn back, I don't
want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -"
"Who?" said Harry as they backtracked quickly.
"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor," said
Hermione.
"She haunts a toilet?"
"Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and
flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful
trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -"
"Look, food!" said Ron.
On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black
velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their
tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid
on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on
salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry
green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a
tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de MimsyPorpington
died 31st October, 1492
Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched
low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through
one of the stinking salmon.
"Can you taste it if you walk though it?" Harry asked him.
"Almost," said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.
"I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor," said Hermione
knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid
haggis.
"Can we move? I feel sick," said Ron.
They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped
suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.
"Hello, Peeves," said Harry cautiously.
Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse
of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a
revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.
"Nibbles?" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in
fungus.
"No thanks," said Hermione.
"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle," said Peeves, his eyes dancing.
"Rude you was about poor Myrtle." He took a deep breath and bellowed,
"OY! MYRTLE!"
"Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset," Hermione
whispered frantically. "I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Myrtle."
The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry
had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.
"What?" she said sulkily.
"How are you, Myrtle?" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. "It's nice to
see you out of the toilet."
Myrtle sniffed.
"Miss Granger was just talking about you -" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's
ear.
"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight," said Hermione, glaring
at Peeves.
Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.
"You're making fun of me," she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her
small, see-through eyes.
"No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?" said
Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.
"Oh, yeah -"
"She did -"
"Don't lie to me," Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while
Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. "D'you think I don't know what
people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable,
moaning, moping Myrtle!"
"You've forgotten pimply," Peeves hissed in her ear.
Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon.
Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, "Pimply!
Pimply!"
"Oh, dear," said Hermione sadly.
Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.
"Enjoying yourselves?"
"Oh, yes," they lied.
"Not a bad turnout," said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. "The Wailing
Widow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It's nearly time for my speech,
I'd better go and warn the orchestra. . . ."
The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and
everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a
hunting horn sounded.
"Oh, here we go," said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.
Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a
headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too,
but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face.
The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing
and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his
bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn.
The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the
crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick,
squashing his head back onto his neck.
"Nick!" he roared. "How are you? Head still hanging in there?"
He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.
"Welcome, Patrick," said Nick stiffly.
"Live 'uns!" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving
a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd
howled with laughter).
"Very amusing," said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.
"Don't mind Nick!" shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor. "Still upset we
won't let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -"
"I think," said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, "Nick's very
- frightening and - er -"
"Ha!" yelled Sir Patrick's head. "Bet he asked you to say that!"
"If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!" said Nearly
Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy
blue spotlight.
"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . ."
But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt
had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to
watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave
up as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers.
Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.
"I can't stand much more of this," Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the
orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance
floor.
"Let's go," Harry agreed.
They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked
at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of
black candles.
"Pudding might not be finished yet," said Ron hopefully, leading the way
toward the steps to the entrance hall.
And then Harry heard it.
". . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . ."
It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in
Lockhart's office.
He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his
might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.
"Harry, what're you -?"
"It's that voice again - shut up a minute -"
". . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . ."
"Listen!" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.
". . . kill . . . time to kill . . ."
The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away -
moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared
at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to
whom stone ceilings didn't matter?
"This way," he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance
hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the
Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the
marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.
"Harry, what're we -"
"SHH!"
Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter
still, he heard the voice: ". . . I smell blood. . . . I SMELL BLOOD!"
His stomach lurched -
"It's going to kill someone!" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's
bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to
listen over his own pounding footsteps -
Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione
panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last,
deserted passage.
"Harry, what was that all about?" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. "I
couldn't hear anything. . . ."
But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.
"Look!"
Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly,
squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the
wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming
torches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir,
beware.
"What's that thing - hanging underneath?" said Ron, a slight quiver in his
voice.
As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of
water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward
the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them
realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash..Mrs. Norris,
the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch
bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.
For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, "Let's get out of here."
"Shouldn't we try and help -" Harry began awkwardly.
"Trust me," said Ron. "We don't want to be found here."
But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that
the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood
came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy
talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the
passage from both ends.
The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted
the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the
corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see
the grisly sight.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.
CHAPTER NINE
THE WRTITING ON THE WALL
What's going on here? What's going on?" Attracted no doubt by
Malfoy's shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the
crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in
horror.
"My cat! My cat! What's happened to Mrs. Norris?" he shrieked.
And his popping eyes fell on Harry.
"You!"he screeched. "You! You've murdered my cat! You've
killed her! I'll kill you! I'll -"
"Argus!"
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione
and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.
"Come with me, Argus," he said to Filch. "You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr.
Weasley, Miss Granger."
Lockhart stepped forward eagerly.
"My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -"
"Thank you, Gilderoy," said Dumbledore.
The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and
important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall
and Snape.
As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of
movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the
pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit
the candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris
on the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool
of candlelight, watching.
The tip of Dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from
Mrs. Norris's fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon
spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor
McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape
loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar
expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And
Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.
"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian
Torture - I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I
know the very countercurse that would have saved her . .....
Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs.
He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris,
his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn't help feeling a
bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as
he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled
for sure.
Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and
tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She
continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.
". . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,"
said Lockhart, "a series of attacks, the full story's in my
autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various
amulets, which cleared the matter up at once ......
The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in
agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair
net.
At last Dumbledore straightened up.
"She's not dead, Argus," he said softly.
Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of
murders he had prevented.
"Not dead?" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris.
"But why's she all - all stiff and frozen?"
"She has been Petrified," said Dumbledore ("Ah! I thought so!" said
Lockhart). "But how, I cannot say . . . ."
"Ask him!" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to
Harry.
"No second year could have done this," said Dumbledore firmly. "it
would take Dark Magic of the most advanced -"
"He did it, he did it!" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. "You saw
what he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I'm a -
I'm a -" Filch's face worked horribly. "He knows I'm a Squib!" he
finished.
"I never touched Mrs. Norris!" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably
aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the
walls. "And I don't even know what a Squib is."
"Rubbish!" snarled Filch. "He saw my Kwikspell letter!"
"If I might speak, Headmaster," said Snape from the shadows, and
Harry's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had
to say was going to do him any good.
"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the
wrong time," he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he
doubted it. "But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.
Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't he at the
Halloween feast?"
Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the
deathday party. ". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were
there -"
"But why not join the feast afterward?" said Snape, his black eyes
glittering in the candlelight. "Why go up to that corridor?"
Ron and Hermione looked at Harry.
"Because - because -" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast;
something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he
had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,
"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed," he said.
"Without any supper?" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across
his gaunt face. "I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people
at their parties."
"We weren't hungry," said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge
rumble.
Snape's nasty smile widened.
"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful," he
said. "It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges
until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should
be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be
honest."
"Really, Severus," said Professor McGonagall sharply, "I see no
reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn't hit over the
head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has
done anything wrong."
Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling lightblue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.
"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus," he said firmly.
Snape looked furious. So did Filch.
"My cat has been Petrified!" he shrieked, his eyes popping. "I want to
see some punishment!"
"We will be able to cure her, Argus," said Dumbledore patiently.
"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As
soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that
will revive Mrs. Norris."
"I'll make it," Lockhart butted in. "I must have done it a hundred times.
I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -"
"Excuse me," said Snape icily. "But I believe I am the Potions master
at this school."
There was a very awkward pause.
"You may go," Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When
they were a floor up from Lockhart's office, they turned into
an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry
squinted at his friends' darkened faces.
"D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?"
"No," said Ron, without hesitation. "Hearing voices no one else can
hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world."
Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask, "You do believe me, don't
you?"
"'Course I do," said Ron quickly. "But -you must admit it's weird ......
"I know it's weird," said Harry. "The whole thing's weird. What was
that writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened...
What's that supposed to mean?"
"You know, it rings a sort of bell," said Ron slowly. "I think someone
told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might've
been Bill . . . ."
"And what on earth's a Squib?" said Harry.
To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.
"Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch, he said. "A Squib is
someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any
magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but
Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch's trying to learn magic from a
Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot.
Like why he hates students so much." Ron gave a satisfied smile.
"He's bitter."
A clock chimed somewhere.
"Midnight," said Harry. "We'd better get to bed before Snape comes
along and tries to frame us for something else."
For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on
Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot
where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might
come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall
with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no
effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When
Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking redeyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and
trying to put them in detention for things like "breathing loudly' and
"looking happy."
Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate.
According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.
"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris," Ron told her
bracingly. "Honestly, we're much better off without her." Ginny's lip
trembled. "Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts," Ron
assured her. "They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of
here in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's
expelled. I'm only joking -" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.
The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for
Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing
almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response
from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the
following Wednesday did they find out.
Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay
behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he
went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-
Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming
toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin
caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite
direction.
Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of
Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-long
composition on "The Medieval Assembly of European
Wizards."
"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short said Ron fu
riously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll.
"And Hermione's done four feet seven inches and her writing's
tiny. "
"Where is she?" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling
his own homework.
"Somewhere over there," said Ron, pointing along the shelves. "Looking
for another book. I think she's trying to read the whole library before
Christmas."
Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.
"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot," said Ron,
scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. "All that junk
about Lockhart being so great -"
Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable
and at last seemed ready to talk to them.
"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out," she said,
sitting down next to Harry and Ron. "And there's a two-week waiting
list. I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk
with all the Lockhart books."
"Why do you want it?" said Harry.
"The same reason everyone else wants it," said Hermione, "to read
up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets."
"What's that?" said Harry quickly.
"That's just it. I can't remember," said Hermione, biting her lip. "And
I can't find the story anywhere else -"
"Hermione, let me read your composition," said Ron desperately,
checking his watch.
"No, I won't," said Hermione, suddenly severe. "You've had ten
days to finish it -"
"I only need another two inches, come on -"
The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic,
bickering.
History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor
Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most
exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the
room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people
said he hadn't noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach
one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the
staff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.
Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and
began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly
everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to
long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again.
He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened
that had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.
Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec

ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.
"Miss - er -?"
"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything
about the Chamber of Secrets," said Hermione in a clear voice.
Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open,
gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown's
head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped
off his desk.
Professor Binns blinked.
"My subject is History of Magic," he said in his dry, wheezy voice. "I
deal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends." He cleared his
throat with a small noise like chalk s!-ping and continued, "In
September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers"
He stuttered to a halt. Hermione's hand was waving in the air again.
"Miss Grant?"
"Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact?"
Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was
sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.
"Well," said Professor Binns slowly, "yes, one could argue that, I
suppose." He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a
student properly before. "However, the legend of which you speak is
such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -"
But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns's every
word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry
could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of
interest.
"Oh, very well," he said slowly. "Let me see ... the Chamber of
Secrets ...
"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand
years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after
them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and
Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying
Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common
people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution."
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.
"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking
out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the
castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between
them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin
wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He
believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.
He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be
untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the
subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the
school."
Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled
old tortoise.
"Reliable historical sources tell us this much," he said. "But these
honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the
Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a
hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew
nothing.
"Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets
so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at
the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of
Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of
all who were unworthy to study magic."
There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn't the
usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns's classes. There was
unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for
more. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.
"The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course," he said. "Naturally,
the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many
times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A
tale told to frighten the gullible."
Hermione's hand was back in the air.
"Sir - what exactly do you mean by the within' the
Chamber?"
"That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of
Slytherin alone can control," said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy
voice.
The class exchanged nervous looks.
"I tell you, the thing does not exist," said Professor Binns, shuffling his
notes. "There is no Chamber and no monster."
"But, sir," said Seamus Finnigan, "if the Chamber can only be opened
by Slytherin's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would
they?"
"Nonsense, O'Flaherty," said Professor Binns in an aggravated
tone. "If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and
headmistresses haven't found the thing -"
"But, Professor," piped up Parvati Patil, "you'd probably have to use
Dark Magic to open it -"
"Just because a wizard doesn't use Dark Magic doesn't mean he
can't, Miss Pennyfeather," snapped Professor Binns. "I repeat, if the
likes of Dumbledore -"
"But maybe you've got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore
couldn't -" began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had
enough.
"That will do," he said sharply. "It is a myth! It does not exist! There
is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a
secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We
will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable
fact!"
And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.
"I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony," Ron told
Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming
corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before
dinner. "But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I
wouldn't be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat
had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back
home ......
Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn't say anything. His
stomach had just dropped unpleasantly.
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat
had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember,
as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear
when he'd placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great,
you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the
way to greatness, no doubt about that...
But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House's reputa
tion for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not
Slytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you're sure ... better be
Gryffindor...
As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past.
"Hiya, Harry!"
"Hullo, Colin," said Harry automatically.
"Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you're
But Colin was so small he fight against the tide of people
bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, "See you,
Harry!" and he was gone.
"What's a boy in his class saying about you?" Hermione wondered.
"That I'm Slytherin's heir, I expect," said Harry, his stomach dropping
another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-
Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime.
"People here'll believe anything," said Ron in disgust.
The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase
without difficulty.
"D'you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets?" Ron asked
Hermione.
"I don't know," she said, frowning. "Dumbledore couldn't cure
Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her
might not be - well - human."
As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end
of the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped
and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that
there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty
chair stood against the wall bearing the message "The Chamber of
Secrets has been Opened."
"That's where Filch has been keeping guard," Ron muttered.
They looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.
"Can't hurt to have a poke around," said Harry, dropping his bag and
getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching
for clues.
"Scorch marks!" he said. "Here - and here -"
"Come and look at this!" said Hermione. "This is funny . . . ."
Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the
wall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around
twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a
small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though
they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.
"Have you ever seen spiders act like that?" said Hermione
wonderingly.
"No," said Harry, "have you, Ron? Ron?"
He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed
to be fighting the impulse to run.
"What's up?" said Harry.
"I - don't - like - spiders," said Ron tensely.
"I never knew that," said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise.
"You've used spiders in Potions loads of times ......
"I don't mind them dead," said Ron, who was carefully looking
anywhere but at the window. "I just don't like the way they move ....
Hermione giggled.
"It's not funny," said Ron, fiercely. "If you must know, when I was
three, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider
because I broke his toy broomstick .... You wouldn't like them either if
you'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and. .
. "
He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to
laugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said,
"Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from?
Someone's mopped it up."
"It was about here," said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces
past Filch's chair and pointing. "Level with this door."
He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as
though he'd been burned.
"What's the matter?" said Harry.
"Can't go in there," said Ron gruffly. "That's a girls' toilet."
"Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there," said Hermione, standing up
and coming over. "That's Moaning Myrtle's place. Come on, let's have
a look."
And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door.
It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set
foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of
chipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given
off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the
wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of
them was dangling off its hinges.
Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall.
When she reached it she said, "Hello, Myrtle, how are you?"
Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the
tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.
"This is a girls' bathroom," she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously.
"They're not girls."
"No," Hermione agreed. "I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is
in here."
She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.
"Ask her if she saw anything," Harry mouthed at Hermione.
"What are you whispering?" said Myrtle, staring at him.
"Nothing," said Harry quickly. "We wanted to ask -"
"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!" said Myrtle, in a
voice choked with tears. "I do have feelings, you know, even if I am
dead -"
"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you," said Hermione. "Harry only -"
"No one wants to upset me! That's a good one!" howled Myrtle. "My
life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along
ruining my death!"
"We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately," said
Hermione quickly. "Because a cat was attacked right outside your
front door on Halloween."
"Did you see anyone near here that night?" said Harry.
"I wasn't paying attention," said Myrtle dramatically. "Peeves upset me
so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I
remembered that I'm - that I'm "
"Already dead," said Ron helpfully.
Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived
headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing
from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had
come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.
Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged
wearily and said, "Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle ....
Come on, let's go."
Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle's gurgling sobs when a
loud voice made all three of them jump.
"RON!"
Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect
badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.
"That's a girls' bathroom!" he gasped. "What were you -?"
"Just having a look around," Ron shrugged. "Clues, you know -"
Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs.
Weasley.
"Get - away - from - there -" Perry said, striding toward them and
starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. "Don't you care what
this looks like? Coming back here while everyone's at dinner -"
"Why shouldn't we be here?" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring
at Percy. "Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!"
"That's what I told Ginny," said Percy fiercely, "but she still seems to
think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying
her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly
overexcited by this business -"
"You don't care about Ginny," said Ron, whose ears were now
reddening. "You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances of
being Head Boy -"
"Five points from Gryffindor!" Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect
badge. "And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or
I'll write to Mum!"
And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron's ears.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy
in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and
kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his
wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost
as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells,
Grade 2 shut. To Harry's surprise, Hermione followed suit.
"Who can it be, though?" she said in a quiet voice, as though
continuing a conversation they had just been having. "Who'd want to
frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?"
"Let's think," said Ron in mock puzzlement. "Who do we know who
thinks Muggle-borns are scum?"
He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced.
"If you're talking about Malfoy -"
"Of course I am!" said Ron. "You heard him - be next,
Mudbloods!'- come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face to
know it's him -"
"Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?" said Hermione skeptically.
"Look at his family," said Harry, closing his books, too. "The whole lot
of them have been in Slytherin; he's always boasting about it. They
could easily be Slytherin's descendants. His father's definitely evil
enough."
"They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!"
said Ron. "Handing it down, father to son ......
"Well," said Hermione cautiously, "I suppose it's possible ......
"But how do we prove it?" said Harry darkly.
"There might be a way," said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still
further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. "Of course, it
would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We'd be breaking
about fifty school rules, I expect -"
"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know,
won't you?" said Ron irritably.
"All right," said Hermione coldly. "What we'd need to do is to get
inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions
without him realizing it's us."
"But that's impossible," Harry said as Ron laughed.
"No, it's not," said Hermione. "All we'd need would be some Polyjuice
Potion."
"What's that?" said Ron and Harry together.
"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -"
"D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to
Snape?" muttered Ron.
"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could
change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us.
Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He's probably boasting about it
in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him."
"This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me," said Ron, frowning.
"What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?"
"It wears off after a while," said Hermione, waving her hand
impatiently. "But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult.
Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it's
bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library."
There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted
Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher.
"Hard to see why we'd want the book, really," said Ron, "if we
weren't going to try and make one of the potions."
"I think," said Hermione, "that if we made it sound as though
we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance ......
"Oh, come on, no teacher's going to fall for that," said Ron.
"They'd have to be really thick . . . ."
CHAPTER TEN
THE ROGUE BLUDGER
ince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not
brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his
books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic
bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions;
so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager
whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head
cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except
lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.
Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next
Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf If
he hadn't had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good
mood, he would have refused to do it.
"Nice loud howl, Harry - exactly - and then, if you'll believe it, I
pounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand, I
managed to hold him down - with my other, I
put my wand to his throat -I then screwed up my remaining strength
and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he let
out a piteous moan - go on, Harry - higher than that - good - the fur
vanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man. Simple,
yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the
hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf
attacks."
The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.
"Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga
Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the
best one!"
The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room,
where Ron and Hermione were waiting.
"Ready?" Harry muttered.
"Wait till everyone's gone," said Hermione nervously. "All right . . . "
She approached Lockhart's desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in
her hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.
"Er - Professor Lockhart?" Hermione stammered. "I wanted to - to
get this book out of the library. Just for background reading." She
held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. "But the thing
is, it's in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to
sign for it - I'm sure it would help me understand what you say in
Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms
"Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!" said Lockhart, taking the note from
Hermione and smiling widely at her. "Possibly my very favorite
book. You enjoyed it?"
"Oh, yes," said Hermione eagerly. "So clever, the way you trapped that
last one with the tea-strainer -"
"Well, I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year
a little extra help," said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an
enormous peacock quill. "Yes, nice, isn't it?" he said, misreading the
revolted look on Ron's face. "I usually save it for book-signings."
He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it
back to Hermione.
"So, Harry," said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with
fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. "Tomorrow's the first
Quidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin,
is it not? I hear you're a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was
asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life
to the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need
for a little private training, don't hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass
on my expertise to less able players ......
Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after
Ron and Hermione.
"I don't believe it," he said as the three of them examined the signature
on the note. "He didn't even look at the book we wanted."
"That's because he's a brainless git," said Ron. "But who cares, we've
got what we needed -"
"He is not a brainless git," said Hermione shrilly as they half ran
toward the library.
"Just because he said you were the best student of the year -"
They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the
library. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who
looked like an underfed vulture.
"Moste Potente Potions?" she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the
note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn't let go.
"I was wondering if I could keep it," she said breathlessly.
"Oh, come on," said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it
at Madam Pince. "We'll get you another autograph. Lockhart'll sign
anything if it stands still long enough."
Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to
detect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the
lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and
moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they
left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.
Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out-oforder bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron's objections
by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds
would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle
was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she
them.
Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of
them bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance
why it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had
effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very
unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have
been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of
arms out of her head.
"Here it is," said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The
Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway
through transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had
imagined the looks of intense pain on their
faces.
"This is the most complicated potion I've ever seen," said Hermione as
they scanned the recipe. "Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and
knotgrass," she murmured, running her finger down the list of
ingredients. "Well, they're easy enough, they're in the student storecupboard, we can help ourselves .... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a
bicorn - don't know where we're going to get that - shredded skin of a
boomslang -. that'll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we
want to change into."
"Excuse me?" said Ron sharply. "What d'you mean, a bit of whoever
we're changing into? I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it -"
Hermione continued as though she hadn't heard him.
"We don't have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those
bits last ......
Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry.
"D'you realize how much we're going to have to steal, Hermione?
Shredded skin of a boomslang, that's definitely not in the students'
cupboard. What're we going to do, break into Snape's private stores? I
don't know if this is a good idea ......
Hermione shut the book with a snap.
"Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine," she said. There were
bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than
usual. "I don't want to break rules, you know. I think threatening
Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if
you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy, I'll go straight to Madam Pince
now and hand the book back in
"I never thought Id see the day when you'd be persuading us to
break rules," said Ron. "All right, we'll do it. But not toenails, okay?"
"How long will it take to make, anyway?" said Harry as Hermione,
looking happier, opened the book again.
"Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and
the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I'd say
it'd be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients."
"A month?" said Ron. "Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggleborns in the school by then!" But Hermione's eyes narrowed
dangerously again, and he added swiftly, "But it's the best plan we've
got, so full steam ahead, I say."
However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for
them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, "It'll be a lot less
hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.
Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking
about the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the
thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the
idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold
could buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After
half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up,
dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest
of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking
uptight and not speaking much.
As eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make its
way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day
with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying
over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The
team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to
Wood's usual pre-match pep talk.
"Slytherin has better brooms than us," he began. "No point denying it.
But we've got better people on our brooms. We've trained harder than
they have, we've been flying in all weathers -" ("Too true," muttered
George Weasley. "I haven't been properly dry since August") "- and
we're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime,
Malfoy, buy his way onto their team."
Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.
"It'll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have
something more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or
die trying, Harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to."
"So no pressure, Harry" said Fred, winking at him.
As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly
cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see
Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and
hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint
and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other
threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.
"On my whistle," said Madam Hooch. "Three ... two ... one. . .
With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen
players rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of
them, squinting around for the Snitch.
"All right there, Scarhead?" yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as
though to show off the speed of his broom.
Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black
Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he
felt it ruffle his hair as it passed.
"Close one, Harry!" said George, streaking past him with his club in his
hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw
George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian
Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight
for Harry again.
Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard
toward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang
and shot at Harry's head.
Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the
pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What
was going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it
was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible ....
Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry
ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger
was knocked off course.
"Gotcha!" Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was
magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once
more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed.
It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face,
splattering onto his glasses. He didn't have a clue what was going on
in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was
commentating, say, "Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero
The Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and
meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry
out of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on
either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms
and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.
"Someone's - tampered - with - this - Bludger -" Fred grunted,
swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on
Harry.
"We need time out," said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop
the Bludger breaking Harry's nose at the same time.
Wood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch's whistle rang
out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to
avoid the mad Bludger.
"What's going on?" said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled
together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. "We're being
flattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped
Angelina scoring?"
"We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from
murdering Harry, Oliver," said George angrily. "Someone's fixed it -
it won't leave Harry alone. It hasn't gone for anyone else all game.
The Slytherins must have done something to it."
"But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office since
our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . . "
said Wood, anxiously.
Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry
could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction.
"Listen," said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, "with you two
flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch the
Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and
let me deal with the rogue one."
"Don't be thick," said Fred. "It'll take your head off."
Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.
(I Oliver, this is insane," said Alicia Spinner angrily. "You can't let Harry
deal with that thing on his own. Let's ask for an inquiry -))
"If we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match!" said Harry. "And
we're not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come
on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!"
"This is all your fault," George said angrily to Wood. " the Snitch
or die trying,' what a stupid thing to tell him -"
Madam Hooch had joined them.
"Ready to resume play?" she asked Wood.
Wood looked at the determined look on Harry's face.
"All right," he said. "Fred, George, you heard Harry -leave him alone
and let him deal with the Bludger on his own."
The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch's whistle,
Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the
Bludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and
swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless
kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his
nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the
Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must
look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change
direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster
ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of
rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past
Wood
A whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him
again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.
"Training for the ballet, Potter?" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to
do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the
Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at
Malfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches
above Malfoy's left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn't
seen it.
For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed
toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.
WHAM.
He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last,
smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by
the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched
broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at
his side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time
W-ming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly
lodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy.
Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering
face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought
Harry was attacking him.
"What the -" he gasped, careening out of Harry's way.
Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch;
he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only
gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd
below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass
out.
With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His
arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard,
as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He
focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.
"Aha," he said vaguely. "We've won."
And he fainted.
He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with
someone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth.
"Oh, no, not you," he moaned.
"Doesn't know what he's saying," said Lockhart loudly to the anxious
crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. "Not to worry, Harry.
I'm about to fix your arm."
"No!"said Harry. "I'll keep it like this, thanks ......
He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar
clicking noise nearby.
"I don't want a photo of this, Colin," he said loudly.
"Lie back, Harry," said Lockhart soothingly. "It's a simple charm I've
used countless times -"
"Why can't I just go to the hospital wing?" said Harry through
clenched teeth.
"He should really, Professor," said a muddy Wood, who couldn't
help grinning even though his Seeker was injured. "Great capture,
Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -"
Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred an
George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still
putting up a terrific fight.
"Stand back," said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green
sleeves.
"No - don't -" said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand
and a second later had directed it straight at Harry's arm.
A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder and
spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was
being deflated. He didn't dare look at what was happening. He had
shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears
were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey
began clicking away madly. His arm didn't hurt anymore - nor did it
feel remotely like an arm.
"Ah," said Lockhart. "Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the
point is, the bones are no longer broken. That's the thing to bear in
mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley,
Miss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be
able to - er - tidy you up a bit."
As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep
breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him
pass out again.
Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-
colored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.
Lockhart hadn't mended Harry's bones. He had removed them.
Madam Pomfrey wasn't at all pleased.
"You should have come straight to me!" she raged, holding up
the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a
working arm. "I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back -
"
"You will be able to, won't you?" said Harry desperately.
"I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful," said Madam Pomfrey
grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. "You'll have to stay the
night ......
Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed while
Ron helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery,
boneless arm into a sleeve.
"How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?" Ron called
through the curtain as he pulled Harry's limp fingers through the cuff.
"If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked."
"Anyone can make a mistake," said Hermione. "And it doesn't hurt
anymore, does it, Harry?"
"No," said Harry, getting into bed. "But it doesn't do anything else
either."
As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.
Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam
Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.
"You're in for a rough night," she said, pouring out a steaming
beakerful and handing it to him. "Regrowing bones is a nasty business.
So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry's mouth and throat as it
went down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about
dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron
and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some
water.
"We won, though," said Ron, a grin breaking across his face.
"That was some catch you made. Malfoy's face ... he looked ready
to kill ......
"I want to know how he fixed that Bludger," said Hermione
darkly.
"We can add that to the list of questions we'll ask him when
we've taken the Polyjuice Potion," said Harry, sinking back onto
his pillows. "I hope it tastes better than this stuff .....
"If it's got bits of Slytherins in it? You've got to be joking," said
Ron.
The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy
and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see
Harry.
"Unbelievable flying, Harry," said George. "I've just seen Mar
cus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on
top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn't seem too happy."
They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice;
they gathered around Harry's bed and were just getting started on
what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came
storming over, shouting, "This boy needs rest, he's got thirty-three
bones to regrow! Out! OUT!"
And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the
stabbing pains in his limp arm.
Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch
blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of
large splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken
him. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was
sponging his forehead in the dark.
"Get off!" he said loudly, and then, "Dobby!"
The house-elf's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry
through the darkness. A single tear was running down his long,
pointed nose.
"Harry Potter came back to school," he whispered miserably.
"Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn't you
heed Dobby? Why didn't Harry Potter go back home when he
missed the train?"
Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby's sponge
away.
"What're you doing here?" he said. "And how did you know I missed
the train?"
Dobby's lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion.
"It was you!" he said slowly. "You stopped the barrier from letting us
through!"
"Indeed yes, sir," said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears
flapping. "Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the
gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward" - he showed
Harry ten long, bandaged fingers - "but Dobby didn't care, sir, for he
thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry
Potter would get to school another way!"
He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.
"Dobby was 'so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at
Hogwarts, he let his master's dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby
never had, sir . .....
Harry slumped back onto his pillows.
"You nearly got Ron and me expelled," he said fiercely. "You'd better
get lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you."
Dobby smiled weakly.
"Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day
at home."
He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking
so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself.
"Why d'you wear that thing, Dobby?" he asked curiously.
"This, sir?" said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. "'Tis a mark of the
house-elf's enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters
present him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby
even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house
forever."
Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, "Harry Potter must
go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make -"
"Your Bludger?" said Harry, anger rising once more. "What d'you
mean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?"
"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!" said Dobby, shocked. "Dobby wants
to save Harry Potter's life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than
remain here sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be
sent home!"
"Oh, is that all?" said Harry angrily. "I don't suppose you're going to
tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?"
"Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!" Dobby groaned, more tears dripping
onto his ragged pillowcase. "If he knew what he means
to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world!
Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
was at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elfs were treated like
vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir," he admitted,
drying his face on the pillowcase. "But mostly, sir, life has improved
for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord's power was broken, and it
was a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope
for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit... And
now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening
already, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history
is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more
Dobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry's water jug from his
bedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A
second later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering,
"Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby. . ."
"So there is a Chamber of Secrets?" Harry whispered. "And did you
say it's been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!"
He seized the elf's bony wrist as Dobby's hand inched toward the
water jug. "But I'm not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the
Chamber?"
"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby," stammered the elf,
his eyes huge in the dark. "Dark deeds are planned in this place, but
Harry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home, Harry
Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, 'tis too
dangerous -"
"Who is it, Dobby?" Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby's
wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. "Who's
opened it? Who opened it last time?"
"Dobby can't, sir, Dobby can't, Dobby mustn't tell!" squealed the elf.
"Go home, Harry Potter, go home!"
"I'm not going anywhere!" said Harry fiercely. "One of my best
friends is Muggle-born; she'll be first in line if the Chamber really has
been opened -"
"Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!" moaned Dobby in a
kind of miserable ecstasy. "So noble! So valiant! But he must save
himself, he must, Harry Potter must not -"
Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too.
There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside.
"Dobby must go!" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack,
and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back
into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the
footsteps drew nearer.
Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a
long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end
of what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a
second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.
"Get Madam Pomfrey," whispered Dumbledore, and Professor
McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry's bed out of sight. Harry lay
quite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then
Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by
Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress.
He heard a sharp intake of breath.
"What happened?" Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore,
bending over the statue on the bed.
"Another attack," said Dumbledore. "Minerva found him on the stairs.
"There was a bunch of grapes next to him," said Professor
McGonagall. "We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter."
Harry's stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised
himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray
of moonlight lay across its staring face.
It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck
up in front of him, holding his camera.
"Petrified?" whispered Madam Pomfrey.
"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "But I shudder to think ... If Albus
hadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows
what might have -"
The three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned
forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin's rigid grip.
"You don't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?" said
Professor McGonagall eagerly.
Dumbledore didn't answer. He opened the back of the camera.
"Good gracious!" said Madam Pomfrey.
A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away,
caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.
"Melted," said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. "All melted..."
"What does this mean, Albus?" Professor McGonagall asked
urgently.
"It means," said Dumbledore, "that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed
open again."
Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall
stared at Dumbledore.
"But, Albus ... surely ... who?"
"The question is not who," said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin.
"The question is, how . . . ."
And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall's shad
owy face, she didn't understand this any better than he did.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with
winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly
and looked over at Colin's bed, but it had been blocked from view by
the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he
was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray
and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.
"All in order," she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded.
"When you've finished eating, you may leave."
Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor
Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby,
but they weren't there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where
they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren't
interested in whether he had his bones back or not.
As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it,
looking in far better spirits than last time they'd met.
"Oh, hello, Harry," he said. "Excellent flying yesterday, really
excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup you
earned fifty points!"
"You haven't seen Ron or Hermione, have you?" said Harry.
"No, I haven't," said Percy, his smile fading. "I hope Ron's not in
another girls' toilet .....
Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then
headed straight for Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. He couldn't see why
Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure
that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door
and heard their voices coming from a locked stall.
"It's me," he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a
splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione's eye
peering through the keyhole.
she said. "You gave us such a fright - come in how's your
arm?"
"Fine," said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was
perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry
they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires
was a speciality of Hermione's.
"We'd've come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the
Polyjuice Potion," Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the
stall again. "We've decided this is the safest place to hide it."
Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.
"We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall telling
Professor Flitwick this morning. That's why we decided we'd better get
going -"
"The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better," snarled
Ron. "D'you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after
the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin."
"There's something else," said Harry, watching Hermione tearing
bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. "Dobby came
to visit me in the middle of the night."
Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything
Dobby had told him - or hadn't told him. Hermione and Ron listened
with their mouths open.
"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?" Hermione said.
"This settles it," said Ron in a triumphant voice. "Lucius Malfoy must've
opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he's told
dear old Draco how to do it. It's obvious. Wish Dobby'd told you what
kind of monster's in there, though. I want to know how come nobody's
noticed it sneaking around the school."
"Maybe it can make itself invisible," said Hermione, prodding leeches to
the bottom of the cauldron. "Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to
be a suit of armor or something - I've read about Chameleon Ghouls -"
"You read too much, Hermione," said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on
top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked
at Harry.
"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your
arm He shook his head. "You know what, Harry? If he doesn't
stop trying to save your life he's going to kill you."
The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying
as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire
school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor
and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in
tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they
ventured forth alone.
Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was
distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the
wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering
themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind
statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told
them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was
having nightmares.
Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans,
amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school.
Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a
pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other
Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.
"They went for Filch first," Neville said, his round face fearful. "And
everyone knows I'm almost a Squib."
In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came
around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at
school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they
had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very
suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the
Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.
Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still
needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place
they were going to get them was from Snape's private stores. Harry
privately felt he'd rather face Slytherin's legendary monster than let
Snape catch him robbing his office.
"What we need," said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon's
double Potions lesson loomed nearer, "is a diversion. Then one of us
can sneak into Snape's office and take what we need."
Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.
"I think Id better do the actual stealing," Hermione continued in a
matter-of-fact tone. "You two will be expelled if you get into any more
trouble, and I've got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause
enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.
Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potions
class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons
stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass
scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes,
making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors' work while the
Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's
favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who
knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you
could say "Unfair."
Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on
more important things. He was waiting for Hermione's signal, and he
hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery
potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione
caught Harry's eye and nodded.
Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred's
Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his
wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only
seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it
landed right on target in Goyle's cauldron.
Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked
as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and
his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his
hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate -
Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened.
Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's
office.
"Silence! SILENCE!" Snape roared. "Anyone who has been splashed,
come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -"
Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head
drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the
class lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with arms
like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Harry
saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes
bulging.
When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings
had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped out
the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.
"If I ever find out who threw this," Snape whispered, "I shall make
sure that person is expelled."
Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled
expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten
minutes later could not have been more welcome.
"He knew it was me," Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried
back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. "I could tell."
Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to
stir feverishly.
"It'll be ready in two weeks," she said happily.
"Snape can't prove it was you," said Ron reassuringly to Harry.
"What can he do?"
"Knowing Snape, something foul," said Harry as the potion frothed
and bubbled.
A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the
entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around
the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been
pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them
over, looking excited.
"They're starting a Dueling Club!" said Seamus. "First meeting
tonight! I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy
one of these days ......
"What, you reckon Slytherin's monster can duel?" said Ron, but he,
too, read the sign with interest.
"Could be useful," he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into
dinner. "Shall we go?"
Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock that
evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables
had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by
thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety
black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed
beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.
"I wonder who'll be teaching us?" said Hermione as they edged into
the chattering crowd. "Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling
champion when he was young - maybe it'll be him."
"As long as it's not -" Harry began, but he ended on a groan:
Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes
of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing
his usual black.
Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called ' "Gather round,
gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me?
Excellent!
"Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start
this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend
yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full
details, see my published works.
"Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape," said Lockhart,
flashing a wide smile. "He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about
dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short
demonstration before we begin. Now, I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry - you'll still have your Potions master when I'm
through with him, never fear!"
"Wouldn't it be good if they finished each other off?" Ron muttered in
Harry's ear.
Snape's upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart
was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he'd have
been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.
Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least,
Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked
his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of
them.
"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative
position," Lockhart told the silent crowd. "On the count of three, we
will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course."
"I wouldn't bet on that," Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his
teeth.
"One - two - three -"
Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them
at their opponent; Snape cried: "Expelliarmus!" There was a dazzling
flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew
backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to
sprawl on the floor.
Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was
dancing on tiptoes. "Do you think he's all right?" she squealed through
her fingers.
"Who cares?" said Harry and Ron together.
Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and
his wavy hair was standing on end.
"Well, there you have it!" he said, tottering back onto the platform.
"That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I've lost my wand - ah,
thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying
so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to
stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be
instructive to let them see . . ."
Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because
he said, "Enough demonstrating! I'm going to come amongst you now
and put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you'd like to help me -"
They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart
teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry
and Ron first.
"Time to split up the dream team, I think," he sneered. "Weasley, you
can partner Finnigan. Potter -"
Harry moved automatically toward Hermione.
"I don't think so," said Snape, smiling coldly. "Mr. Malfoy, come over
here. Let's see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss
Granger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode."
Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who
reminded Harry of a picture he'd seen in Holidays with Hags. She was
large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione
gave her a weak smile that she did not return.
"Face your partners!" called Lockhart, back on the platform. "And
bow!"
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off
each other.
"Wands at the ready!" shouted Lockhart. "When I count to three, cast
your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don't
want any accidents - one ... two ... three -"
Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on "two":
His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the
head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be
working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at
Malfoy and shouted, "Rictusempra!"
A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up,
wheezing.
"I said disarm only!" Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a
Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung
back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy
while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath,
Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees, choked, "Tarantallegra!"
and the next second Harry's legs began to jerk around out of his
control in a kind of quickstep.
"Stop! Stop!" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge.
"Finite Incantatem!" he shouted; Harry's feet stopped dancing, Malfoy
stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.
A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Neville
and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an
ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had
done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving;
Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering
in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt
forward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger
than he was.
"Dear, dear," said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at
the aftermath of the duels. "Up you go, Macmillan ....
Careful there, Miss Fawcett .... Pinch it hard, it'll stop bleeding in a
second, Boot
"I think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells," said
Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at
Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. "Let's
have a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about
you -"
"A bad idea, Professor Lockhart," said Snape, gliding over like a large
and malevolent bat. "Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest
spells. We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchley up to the
hospital wing in a matchbox." Neville's round, pink face went pinker.
"How about Malfoy and Potter?" said Snape with a twisted smile.
"Excellent idea!" said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the
middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.
"Now, Harry," said Lockhart. "When Draco points his wand at you,
you do this."
He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling
action, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up,
saying, "Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -"
Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something
in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart
and said, "Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?"
"Scared?" muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn't hear him.
"You wish," said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.
Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. "Just do what I did,
Harry!"
"What, drop my wand?"
But Lockhart wasn't listening.
"Three - two - one - go!" he shouted.
Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, "Serpensortia!"
The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black
snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and
raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd
backed swiftly away, clearing the floor.
"Don't move, Potter," said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of
Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. "I'll get
rid of it ......
"Allow me!" shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake
and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten
feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged,
hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and
raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.
Harry wasn't sure what made him do it. He wasn't even aware of
deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him
forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly
at the snake, "Leave him alone!" And miraculously - inexplicably - the
snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its
eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the
snake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn't
have explained.
He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking
relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and
scared.
"What do you think you're playing at?" he shouted, and before Harry
could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.
Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a
small puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an
unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry
didn't like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all
around the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.
"Come on," said Rods voice in his ear. "Move - come on -"
Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As
they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as
though they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn't have
a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained
anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty
Gryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair
and said, "You're a Parselmouth. Why didn't you tell us?"
"I'm a what?" said Harry.
Parselmouth!" said Ron. "You can talk to snakes!"
"I know," said Harry. "I mean, that's only the second time I've ever
done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the
zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil
and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I
was a wizard -"
"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?" Ron repeated
faintly.
"So?" said Harry. "I bet loads of people here can do it."
"Oh, no they can't," said Ron. "It's not a very common gift. Harry, this
is bad."
"What's bad?" said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. "What's wrong
with everyone? Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin -"
"Oh, that's what you said to it?"
"What d'you mean? You were there - you heard me -"
"I heard you speaking Parseltongue," said Ron. "Snake language. You
could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you
sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was
creepy, you know -"
Harry gaped at him.
"I spoke a different language? But - I didn't realize - how can I speak
a language without knowing I can speak it?"
Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though
someone had died. Harry couldn't see what was so terrible.
"D'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake
biting off Justin's head?" he said. "What does it matter how I did it as
long as Justin doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt?"
"It matters," said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice,
"because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was
famous for. That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent."
Harry's mouth fell open.
"Exactly," said Ron. "And now the whole school's going to think you're
his great-great-great-great-grandson or something -"
"But I'm not," said Harry, with a panic he couldn't quite explain.
"You'll find that hard to prove," said Hermione. "He lived about a
thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."
Harry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains
around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the
tower window and wondered . . .
Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? He didn't know
anything about his father's family, after all. The Dursleys had always
forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.
Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words
wouldn't come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to
do it.
But I'm in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn't
have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood...
Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to
put you in Slytherin, don't you remember?
Harry turned over. He'd see Justin the next day in Herbology and he'd
explain that he'd been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he
thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.
By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had
turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the
term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves
on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else,
now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and
revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.
Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common
room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of
wizard chess.
"For heaven's sake, Harry," said Hermione, exasperated, as one
of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off
the board. "Go and find Justin if it's so important to you."
So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where
Justin might be.
The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the
thick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry walked
past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of
what was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at
someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger.
Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that
Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and
deciding to check the library first.
A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were
indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn't seem to be
working. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see
that their heads were close together and they were having what looked
like an absorbing conversation. He couldn't see whether Justin was
among them. He was walking toward them when something of what
they were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the
Invisibility section.
"So anyway," a stout boy was saying, "I told Justin to hide up in our
dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his next
victim, it's best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin's
been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to
Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he'd been down
for Eton. That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin's
heir on the loose, is it?"
"You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?" said a girl with blonde
pigtails anxiously.
"Hannah," said the stout boy solemnly, "he's a Parselmouth. Everyone
knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a
decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself
Serpent-tongue."
There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on,
"Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir,
Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we
know, Flich's cat's attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying
Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was
lying in the mud. Next thing we know - Creevey's been attacked."
"He always seems so nice, though," said Hannah uncertainly, "and,
well, he's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can't be
all bad, can he?"
Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and
Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie's words.
"No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I
mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have
been blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard
could have survived a curse like that." He dropped his voice until it
was barely more than a whisper, and said, "That's probably why YouKnow-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't want another
Dark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter's
been hiding?"
Harry couldn't take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out
from behind the bookshelves. If he hadn't been feeling so angry, he
would have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the
Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of
him, and the color was draining out of Ernie's face.
"Hello," said Harry. "I'm looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley."
The Hufepuffs' worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all
looked fearfully at Ernie.
"What do you want with him?" said Ernie in a quavering voice.
"I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the
Dueling Club," said Harry.
Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, "We
were all there. We saw what happened."
"Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?"
said Harry.
"All I saw," said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he
spoke, "was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake
toward Justin. "
"I didn't chase it at him!" Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. "It
didn't even touch him!"
"It was a very near miss," said Ernie. "And in case you're getting
ideas," he added hastily, "I might tell you that you can trace my
family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and
my blood's as pure as anyone's, so -"
- cc I don't care what sort of blood you've got!" said Harry fiercely.
"Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?"
"I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with," said Ernie swiftly.
"It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them," said
Harry. "Id like to see you try it."
He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself
a reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded
cover of a large spellbook.
Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going,
he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something
very large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.
"Oh, hello, Hagrid," Harry said, looking up.
Hagrid's face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered
balaclava, but it couldn't possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of
the corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging
from one of his massive, gloved hands.
"All righ', Harry?" he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could
speak. "Why aren't yeh in class?"
"Canceled," said Harry, getting up. "What're you doing in here?"
Hagrid held up the limp rooster.
"Second one killed this term," he explained. "It's either foxes or a
Blood-Suckin Bugbear, an' I need the Headmaster's permission ter
put a charm around the hen coop."
He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowflecked
eyebrows.
"Yeh sure yeh're all righ'? Yeh look all hot an' bothered -"
Harry couldn't bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the
Hufflepuffs had been saying about him.
"It's nothing," he said. "Id better get going, Hagrid, it's Transfiguration
next and I've got to pick up my books."
He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.
"Justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he
let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born .....
Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor,
which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a
strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He
was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over
something lying on the floor.
He turned to squint at what he'd fallen over and felt as though his
stomach had dissolved.
Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of
shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And
that wasn't all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight
Harry had ever seen.
It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and
transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal,
six inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an
expression of shock identical to Justin's.
Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a
kind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the
deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they
could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled
voices of teachers from the classes on either side.
He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But
he couldn't just leave them lying here .... He had to get help ....
Would anyone believe he hadn't had anything to do with this?
As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a
bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out.
"Why, it's potty wee Potter!" cackled Peeves, knocking Harry's
glasses askew as he bounced past him. "What's Potter up to? Why's
Potter lurking -"
Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down,
he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right
way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed,
"ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL
OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!
ATTAAAACK!"
Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor
and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene
of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and
people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself
pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor
McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom
still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off
aloud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into
their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie
the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.
"Caught in the act!" Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his
finger dramatically at Harry.
"That will do, Macmillan!" said Professor McGonagall sharply.
Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the
scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin
and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:
"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,
You're killing off' students, you think it's good fun -"
"That's enough Peeves!" barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves
zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.
Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and
Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed
to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor
McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to
Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs.
This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This
left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.
"This way, Potter," she said.
"Professor," said Harry at once, "I swear I didn't -"
"This is out of my hands, Potter," said Professor McGonagall curtly.
They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a
large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.
"Lemon drop!" she said. This was evidently a password, because the
gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind
him split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry
couldn't fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that
was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor
McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind
them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last,
slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass
knocker in the shape of a griffin.
He knew now where he was being taken. This must be where
Dumbledore lived.
CHAPTER TWELVE
THE POLYJUICE POTION
hey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor
McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered.
Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.
Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers'
offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore's was by far
the most interesting. If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that he
was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very
pleased to have a chance to look around it.
It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A
number of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables,
whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered
with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom
were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous,
claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered
wizard's hat - the Sorting Hat.
Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and
wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down
and tried it on again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him in
the right House
He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and
lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped
down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he'd put it on.
Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice
said in his ear, "Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?"
"Er, yes," Harry muttered. "Er - sorry to bother you -
I wanted to ask -"
"You've been wondering whether I put you in the right House," said
the hat smartly. "Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. But I
stand by what I said before" - Harry's heart leapt - "you would have
done well in Slytherin -"
Harry's stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and
pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry
pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.
"You're wrong," he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn't move.
Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind
him made him wheel around.
He wasn't alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door
was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey.
Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its
gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull
and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.
Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore's
pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird
burst into flames.
Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked
feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but
couldn't see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave
one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering
pile of ash on the floor.
The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.
"Professor," Harry gasped. "Your bird - I couldn't do anything - he just
caught fire -"
To Harry's astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.
"About time, too," he said. "He's been looking dreadful for days; I've
been telling him to get a move on."
He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry's face.
"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is
time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . ."
Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke
its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.
"It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day," said Dumbledore,
seating himself behind his desk. "He's really very handsome most of
the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures,
phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have
healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets."
In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he
was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled
himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his
penetrating, light-blue stare.
Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of
the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild
look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head
and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.
"It wasn' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!" said Hagrid urgently. "I was
talkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir -
"
Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on,
waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers
everywhere.
"- it can't've bin him, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if I
have to -"
"Hagrid, I -"
"- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never
"Hagrid!" said Dumbledore loudly. "I do not think that Harry
attacked those people."
"Oh," said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. "Right. I'll wait
outside then, Headmaster."
And he stomped out looking embarrassed.
"You don't think it was me, Professor?" Harry repeated hopefully as
Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.
"No, Harry, I don't," said Dumbledore, though his face was somber
again. "But I still want to talk to you."
Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of
his long fingers together.
"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,"
he said gently. "Anything at all."
Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, "You'll
be next, Mudbloods!" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in
Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied
voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said:
"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the
wizarding world." He thought, too, about what everyone was saying
about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected
with Salazar Slytherin ....
"No," said Harry. "There isn't anything, Professor . . . ."
The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what
had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly
Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could
possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible
power could harm someone who was already dead? There was
almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that
students could go home for Christmas.
"At this rate, we'll be the only ones left," Ron told Harry and
Hermione. "Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it's
going to be."
Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed
up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people
were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the
corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired
of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.
Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of
their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting,
"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming
through ......
Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.
"It is not a laughing matter," he said coldly.
"Oh, get out of the way, Percy," said Fred. "Harry's in a hurry."
"Yeah, he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his
fanged servant," said George, chortling.
Ginny didn't find it amusing either.
"Oh, don't," she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he
was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry
off with a large clove of garlic when they met.
Harry didn't mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at
least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous.
But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked
increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.
"It's because he's bursting to say it's really him," said Ron knowingly.
"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you're
getting all the credit for his dirty work."
"Not for long," said Hermione in a satisfied tone. "The Polyjuice
Potion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of him any day
now."
At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds
descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy,
and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run
of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could
play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice
dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at
school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior,
didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had
already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas
because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during
this troubled time.
Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only
ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione,
who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.
"Wake up," she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.
"Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -" said Ron, shielding
his eyes against the light.
"Merry Christmas to you, too," said Hermione, throwing him his
present. "I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to
the potion. It's ready."
Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.
"Are you sure?"
"Positive," said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could
sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster. "If we're going to do it, I
say it should be tonight."
At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very
small package in her beak.
"Hello," said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. "Are you
speaking to me again?"
She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far
better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned
out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a
note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts
for the summer vacation, too.
The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory.
Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided
to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called
Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite
Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather
quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted
sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card
with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which
hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the
bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.
No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later,
could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.
The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen
frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and
mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling,
warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his
favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every
goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred
had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read "Pinhead," kept
asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn't even care
that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks
about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck,
Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time.
Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas
pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their
plans for the evening.
"We still need a bit of the people you're changing into," said
Hermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the
supermarket for laundry detergent. "And obviously, it'll be best if you
can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys best
friends, he'll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the
real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating
him.
"I've got it all worked out," she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry's
and Ron's stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes.
"I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is
make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they
are, they're bound to eat them. Once they're asleep, pull out a few of
their hairs and hide them in a broom closet."
Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.
"Hermione, I don't think -"
"That could go seriously wrong -"
But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one
Professor McGonagall sometimes had.
"The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair," she
said sternly. "You do want to investigate Malfoy, don't you?"
"Oh, all right, all right," said Harry. "But what about you? Whose hair
are you ripping out?"
"I've already got mine!" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle
out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it.
"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling
Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me!
And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the
Slytherins I've decided to come back."
When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion
again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.
"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go
wrong?"
But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the
operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked
in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe
and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling
down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate
cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and
Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly
behind a suit of armor next to the front door.
"How thick can you get?" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe
gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning
stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a
moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their
faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both
keeled over backward onto the floor.
By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall.
Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry
yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's forehead and Ron
pulled out several of Crabbe's hairs. They also stole
their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and
Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they
sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall
in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up
over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.
"Hermione?"
They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shinyfaced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop
of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on
the toilet seat.
"Did you get them?" Hermione asked breathlessly.
Harry showed her Goyle's hair.
"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry," Hermione
said, holding up a small sack. "You'll need bigger sizes once you're
Crabbe and Goyle."
The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked
like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.
"I'm sure I've done everything right," said Hermione, nervously
rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. "It looks like the
book says it should ... once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour
before we change back into ourselves."
"Now what?" Ron whispered.
"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs."
Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses.
Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of
its bottle into the first glass.
The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A
second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.
"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode," said Ron, eyeing it with
loathing. "Bet it tastes disgusting."
"Add yours, then," said Hermione.
Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's
into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned the
khaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown.
"Hang on," said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.
"We'd better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbe
and Goyle we won't fit. And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie.
"Good thinking," said Ron, unlocking the door. "We'll take separate
stalls."
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into
the middle stall.
"Ready?" he called.
"Ready," came Ron's and Hermione's voices.
"One - two - three -"
Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It
tasted like overcooked cabbage.
Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed
live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be
sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the
very ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all
fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body
bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow,
the fingers thickened, the nails broadened,
the knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfully
and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down
toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a
barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too
small
As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown
on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end
toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was
what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off
his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on
the spare ones, and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes. He reached up to
brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry
bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were
clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them - he took
them off and called, "Are you two okay?" Goyle's low rasp of a voice
issued from his mouth.
"Yeah," came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.
Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.
Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched
his ear. So did Goyle.
Ron's door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked
pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the
pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.
"This is unbelievable," said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding
Crabbe's flat nose. "Unbelievable. "
"We'd better get going," said Harry, loosening the watch that was
cutting into Goyle's thick wrist. "We've still got to find out
where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find
someone to follow. . ."
Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, "You don't know how
bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking." He banged on Hermione's door.
"C'mon, we need to go -"
A high-pitched voice answered him.
"I - I don't think I'm going to come after all. You go on without me.
"Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode's ugly, no one's going to
know it's you -"
"No - really - I don't think I'll come. You two hurry up, you re
wasting time
Harry looked at Ron, bewildered.
"That looks more like Goyle," said Ron. "That's how he looks every
time a teacher asks him a question."
"Hermione, are you okay?" said Harry through the door.
"Fine - I'm fine - go on -"
Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had
already passed.
"We'll meet you back here, all right?" he said.
Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked
that the coast was clear, and set off.
"Don't swing your arms like that," Harry muttered to Ron.
"Eh?"
"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . ."
"How's this?"
"Yeah, that's better . . . ."
They went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was
a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but
there was nobody around.
"Any ideas?" muttered Harry.
"The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there," said
Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely
left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the
entrance.
"Excuse me," said Ron, hurrying up to her. "We've forgotten the way
to our common room."
"I beg your pardon?" said the girl stiffly. "Our common room? I'm a
Ravenclaw."
She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.
Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their
footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's huge
feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they
had hoped.
The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and
deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see
how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when
they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.
"Ha!" said Ron excitedly. "There's one of them now!"
The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer,
however, their hearts sank. It wasn't a Slytherin, it was Percy.
"What're you doing down here?" said Ron in surprise.
Percy looked affronted.
"That," he said stiffly, "is none of your business. It's Crabbe, isn't it?"
"Wh - oh, yeah," said Ron.
"Well, get off to your dormitories," said Percy sternly. "It's not safe to
go wandering around dark corridors these days."
"You are," Ron pointed out.
"I," said Percy, drawing himself up, "am a prefect. Nothing's about to
attack me."
A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was
strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was
pleased to see him.
"There you are," he drawled, looking at them. "Have you two been
pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I've been looking for you; I
want to show you something really funny."
Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.
"And what're you doing down here, Weasley?" he sneered.
Percy looked outraged.
"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!" he said. "I
don't like your attitude!"
Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry
almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in
time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into
the next passage, "That Peter Weasley -"
"Percy," Ron corrected him automatically.
"Whatever," said Malfoy. "I've noticed him sneaking around a lot
lately. And I bet I know what he's up to. He thinks he's going to catch
Slytherin's heir single-handed."
He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited
looks.
Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.
"What's the new password again?" he said to Harry.
"Er -" said Harry.
"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door
concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and
Harry and Ron followed him.
The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room
with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps
were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately
carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were
silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.
"Wait here," said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair
of empty chairs set back from the fire. "I'll go and get it my father's
just sent it to me -"
Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron
sat down, doing their best to look at home.
Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a
newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron's nose.
"That'll give you a laugh," he said.
Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly,
gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry.
It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said:
INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office,
was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.
Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry, where the
enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr.
Weasley's resignation.
"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute," Mr. Malfoy told our
reporter. "He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous
Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately."
Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told
reporters to clear off or she'd set the family ghoul on them.
"Well?" said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to
him. "Don't you think it's funny?"
"Ha, ha," said Harry bleakly.
"Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in
half and go and join them," said Malfoy scornfully. "You'd never know
the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave."
Ron's - or rather, Crabbe's - face was contorted with fury.
"What's up with you, Crabbe?" snapped Malfoy.
"Stomachache," Ron grunted.
"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick
from me," said Malfoy, snickering. "You know, I'm surprised the Daily
Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet," he went on thoughtfully.
"I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up. He'll be sacked if it
doesn't stop soon. Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worst
thing that's ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A
decent headmaster would never've let slime like that Creevey in."
Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a
cruel but accurate impression of Colin: can I have your
picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes,
please, Potter?"'
He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.
"What's the matter with you two?"
Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy
seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on
the uptake.
"Saint Potter, the Mudbloods' friend," said Malfoy slowly. "He's
another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around
with that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people think he's
Slytherin's heir!"
Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds
away from telling them it was him - but then
"I wish I knew who it is," said Malfoy petulantly. "I could help them."
Ron's jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than
usual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn't notice, and Harry, thinking fast,
said, "You must have some idea who's behind it all ......
"You know I haven't, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?"
snapped Malfoy. "And Father won't tell me anything about the last
time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years
ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says
that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much
about it. But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time before
one of them's killed this time .... I hope it's Granger," he said with
relish.
Ron was clenching Crabbe's gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a
bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning
look and said, "D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber
last time was caught?"
"Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled," said Malfoy. "They're
probably still in Azkaban."
"Azkaban?" said Harry, puzzled.
"Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle," said Malfoy, looking at him in
disbelief "Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going
backward."
He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, "Father says to keep my
head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the
school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed
up in it. Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment. You
know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?"
Harry tried to force Goyle's dull face into a look of concern.
"Yeah. . ." said Malfoy. "Luckily, they didn't find much. Father's got
some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we've got our own
secret chamber under the drawing-room floor-"
"Ho!" said Ron.
Malfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was
turning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was
up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror
he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.
They both jumped to their feet.
"Medicine for my stomach," Ron grunted, and without further ado
they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled
themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping
against hope that Malfoy hadn't noticed anything. Harry could feel his feet
slipping around in Goyle's huge shoes and had to
hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark
entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the
closet where they'd locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes
outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble
staircase toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
"Well, it wasn't a complete waste of time," Ron panted, closing the
bathroom door behind them. "I know we still haven't found out who's
doing the attacks, but I'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him
to check under the Malfoys' drawing room."
Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal.
He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione's
stall.
"Hermione, come out, we've got loads to tell you -"
"Go away!" Hermione squeaked.
Harry and Ron looked at each other.
"What's the matter?" said Ron. "You must be back to normal by now,
we are
But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had
never seen her looking so happy.
"Ooooooh, wait till you see," she said. "It's awful-"
They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her
robes pulled up over her head.
"What's up?" said Ron uncertainly. "Have you still got Millicent's nose
or something?"
Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.
Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and
there were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.
"It was a c-cat hair!" she howled. "M-Millicent Bulstrode
m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn't supposed to be used for
animal transformations!"
"Uh-oh," said Ron.
"You'll be teased something dreadful," said Myrtle happily.
"It's okay, Hermione," said Harry quickly. "We'll take you up to the
hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions ......
It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom.
Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. "Wait
till everyone finds out you've got a tail!"
ermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a
flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school
arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course
everyone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed
past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam
Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around
Hermione's bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry
face.
Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term
started, they brought her each day's homework.
"If Id sprouted whiskers, Id take a break from work," said Ron, tipping
a stack of books onto Hermione's bedside table one evening.
"Don't be silly, Ron, I've got to keep up," said Hermione briskly. Her
spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had
gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown.
"I don't suppose you've got any new leads?" she added in a whisper,
so that Madam Pomfrey couldn't hear her.
"Nothing," said Harry gloomily.
"I was so sure it was Malfoy," said Ron, for about the hundredth time.
"What's that?" asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out
from under Hermione's pillow.
"Just a get well card," said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of
sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open,
and read aloud:
"To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned
teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class,
Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner
of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award. "
Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted.
"You sleep with this under your pillow?"
But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping
over with her evening dose of medicine.
"Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what?" Ron
said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs
toward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much
homework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before
he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione
how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising
Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their
ears.
"That's Filch," Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and
paused, out of sight, listening hard.
"You don't think someone else's been attacked?" said Ron tensely.
They stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich's voice, which
sounded quite hysterical.
even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven't got enough to
do! No, this is the final straw, I'm going to Dumbledore -"
His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a
distant door slam.
They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been
manning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot
where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what
Filch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over
half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from
under the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Now that Filch had
stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle's wails echoing off the
bathroom walls.
"Now what's up with her?" said Ron.
"Let's go and see," said Harry, and holding their robes over their
ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door
bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.
Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever
before. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in
the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great
rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.
"What's up, Myrtle?" said Harry.
"Who's that?" glugged Myrtle miserably. "Come to throw something
else at me?"
Harry waded across to her stall and said, "Why would I throw
something at you?"
"Don't ask me," Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more
water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. "Here I am,
minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a
book at me ......
"But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you," said
Harry, reasonably. "I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't
it?"
He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked,
"Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points
if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through
her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don't think!"
"Who threw it at you, anyway?" asked Harry.
"I don't know... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about
death, and it fell right through the top of my head," said Myrtle,
glaring at them. "It's over there, it got washed out ......
Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A
small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as
wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to
pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.
"What?" said Harry.
"Are you crazy?" said Ron. "It could be dangerous."
"Dangerous?"said Harry, laughing. "Come off it, how could it be
dangerous?"
"You'd be surprised," said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at
the book. "Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated Dad's told
me - there was one that burned your eyes out. And
everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest
of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could
never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it,
trying to do everything one-handed. And -"
"All right, I've got the point," said Harry.
The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.
"Well, we won't find out unless we look at it," he said, and he ducked
around Ron and picked it up off the floor.
Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover
told him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page
he could just make out the name "T M. Riddle" in smudged ink.
"Hang on," said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking
over Harry's shoulder. "I know that name .... T. M. Riddle got an
award for special services to the school fifty years ago."
"How on earth d'you know that?" said Harry in amazement.
"Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in
detention," said Ron resentfully. "That was the one I burped slugs all
over. If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it,
too."
Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank.
There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even
Auntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three.
"He never wrote in it," said Harry, disappointed.
"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?" said Ron curiously.
Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name
of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.
"He must've been Muggle-born," said Harry thoughtfufly. "To have
bought a diary from Vauxhall Road ......
"Well, it's not much use to you," said Ron. He dropped his voice. "Fifty
points if you can get it through Myrtle's nose."
Harry, however, pocketed it.
Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at
the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor
Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle's diary and told her the story
of how they had found it.
"Oooh, it might have hidden powers," said Hermione enthusiastically,
taking the diary and looking at it closely.
"If it has, it's hiding them very well," said Ron. "Maybe it's shy. I don't
know why you don't chuck it, Harry."
"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it," said Harry. "I
wouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services
to Hogwarts either."
"Could've been anything," said Ron. "Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s or
saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that
would've done everyone a favor .....
But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face that
she was thinking what he was thinking.
"What?" said Ron, looking from one to the other.
"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it?"
he said. "That's what Malfoy said."
"Yeah. . ." said Ron slowly.
"And this diary is fifty years old," said Hermione, tapping it excitedly so?
.
"Oh, Ron, wake up," snapped Hermione. "We know the person who
opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know
T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years
ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of
Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the
Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it -
the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying
around, would they?"
"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione," said Ron, "with just one tiny little
flaw. There's nothing written in his diary."
But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.
"It might be invisible ink!" she whispered.
She tapped the diary three times and said, "Aparecium!"
Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into
her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.
"It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley," she said.
She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.
"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there," said Ron. "Riddle just
got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in."
Harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw
Riddle's diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary
was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages,
as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was
sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed
to mean something to him, almost as though Riddle was a friend he'd had
when he was very small, and had halfforgotten. But this was absurd. He'd
never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.
Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so
next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's
special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a
thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of the
trophy room to last him a lifetime.
Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It
didn't carry details of why it had been given to him ("Good thing, too,
or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it," said Ron). However,
they did find Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on
a list of old Head Boys.
"He sounds like Percy," said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust.
"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -"
"You say that like it's a bad thing," said Hermione in a slightly hurt
voice.
The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside
the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no
more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and
Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were
becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving
childhood.
"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,"
Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. "And after that, it
won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll
have Mrs. Norris back in no time."
Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry.
It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets,
with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster,
whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for
another fifty years ....
Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view. He was
still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had "given
himself away" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn't helping matters; he
kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing "Oh, Potter, you
rotter . . ." now with a dance routine to match.
Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks
stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the
Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.
"I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva," he said, tapping
his nose knowingly and winking. "I think the Chamber has been locked
for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter
of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I
came down hard on him.
"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash
away the memories of last term! I won't say any more just now, but I
think I know just the thing . . . ."
He tapped his nose again and strode off.
Lockhart's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on
February fourteenth. Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a laterunning Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to
the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he'd
walked through the wrong doors.
The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse
still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry
went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking
sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.
"What's going on?" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti
off his bacon.
Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak.
Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was
waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking
stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in
Professor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone had
just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.
"Happy Valentine's Day!" Lockhart shouted. "And may I thank the
forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the
liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end
here!"
Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall
marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however.
Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.
"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!" beamed Lockhart. "They will be
roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun
doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the
spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how
to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick
knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've
ever met, the sly old dog!"
Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as though
the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be
force-fed poison.
"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron
as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly
became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and
didn't answer.
All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver
valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as
the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs
caught up with Harry.
"Oy, you! 'Arty Potter!" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf,
elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line
of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried
to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by
kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces.
"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person," he
said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.
"Not here," Harry hissed, trying to escape.
"Stay still!" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pulling
him back.
"Let me go!" Harry snarled, tugging.
With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand,
parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed
over everything.
Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf
started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.
"What's going on here?" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco
Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped
bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical
valentine.
"What's all this commotion?" said another familiar voice as Percy
Weasley arrived.
Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf
seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.
"Right," he said, sitting on Harry's ankles. "Here is your singing
valentine:
His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,
His hair is as dark as a blackboard.
I wish he was mine, he's really divine,
The hero who conquered the Dark Lord
Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the
spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his
feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his
best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.
"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class,
now," he said, shooing some of the younger students away. "And you,
Malfoy-"
Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something.
Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that
he'd got Riddle's diary.
"Give that back," said Harry quietly.
"Wonder what Potter's written in this?" said Malfoy, who obviously hadn't
noticed the year on the cover and thought he had
Harry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring
from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.
"Hand it over, Malfoy," said Percy sternly.
"When I've had a look," said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at
Harry.
Percy said, "As a school prefect -" but Harry had lost his temper. He
pulled out his wand and shouted, "Expelliarmus!" and just as
Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting
out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.
"Harry!" said Percy loudly. "No magic in the corridors. I'll have to
report this, you know!"
But Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth
five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and
as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after
her, "I don't think Potter liked your valentine much!"
Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling,
Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn't
need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.
It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry
noticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary. All his other
books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as
clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He
tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his
wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end,
and he wasn't much interested in anything else.
Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This
was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George
singing, "His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad" one more time,
and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, and
knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.
Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not
one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new
bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a
blot onto the first page of the diary.
The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it
was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up
his quill a second time and wrote, "My name is Harry Potter."
The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without
trace. Then, at last, something happened.
Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry
had never written.
"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my
diary?"
These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to
scribble back.
"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet."
He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply.
"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink.
But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this
diary read. "
"What do you mean?" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his
excitement.
mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were
covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. "
"That's where I am now," Harry wrote quickly. "I'm at Hogwarts, and
horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the
Chamber of Secrets?"
His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing
becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.
"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it
was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the
Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally
killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was
expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing
had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given
out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny,
engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I
knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the
power to release it was not imprisoned. "
Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.
"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one
seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?"
"I can show you, if you like, "came Riddle's reply. "You don't have
to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night
when I caught him. "
Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle
mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He
glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was
growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words
forming.
"Let me show you. "
Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.
The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind,
stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open,
Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have
turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly,
he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and
before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the
window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was
pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color
and shadow.
He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred
shapes around him came suddenly into focus.
He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the
sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore
who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald
except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by
candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.
"I'm sorry," he said shakily. "I didn't mean to butt in -"
But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly.
Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, "Er - I'll just go, shall
I?"
Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him.
Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.
"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now," he half-shouted.
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past
Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his
window.
The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset.
The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs,
watching the door.
Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring
silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it,
meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore,
and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to
the people of fifty years ago.
There was a knock on the office door.
"Enter," said the old wizard in a feeble voice.
A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver
prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than
Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.
"Ah, Riddle," said the Headmaster.
"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?" said Riddle. He looked
nervous.
"Sit down," said Dippet. "I've just been reading the letter you sent me.
"Oh," said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very
tightly.
"My dear boy," said Dipper kindly, "I cannot possibly let you stay at
school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the
holidays?"
"No," said Riddle at once. "Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go
back to that - to that -"
"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?" said
Dippet curiously.
"Yes, sir," said Riddle, reddening slightly.
"You are Muggle-born?"
"Half-blood, sir," said Riddle. "Muggle father, witch mother."
"And are both your parents -?"
"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the
orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my
father, Marvolo after my grandfather."
Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.
"The thing is, Tom," he sighed, "Special arrangements might have
been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . ."
"You mean all these attacks, sir?" said Riddle, and Harry's heart
leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.
"Precisely," said the headmaster. "My dear boy, you must see how
foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when
term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of
that poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As
a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about
closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all
this unpleasantness . . . ."
Riddle's eyes had widened.
"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -"
"What do you mean?" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting
up in his chair. "Riddle, do you mean you know something about
these attacks?"
"No, sir," said Riddle quickly.
But Harry was sure it was the same sort of "no" that he himself had
given Dumbledore.
Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.
"You may go, Tom ......
Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry
followed him.
Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the
gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did
Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some
serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.
Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off,
Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn't see another person
until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long,
sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble
staircase.
"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?"
Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-yearyounger Dumbledore.
"I had to see the headmaster, sir," said Riddle.
"Well, hurry off to bed," said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the
kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. "Best not to roam the
corridors these days. Not since . . ."
He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle
watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed
straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot
pursuit.
But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden
passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which
Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn't been lit, and when
Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just
see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.
It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could
see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack,
waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling
expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present,
he heard something move beyond the door.
Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was
pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a
shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind
him, forgetting that he couldn't be heard.
For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle
stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises.
Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a
hoarse whisper.
"C'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here .... C'mon now ... in the box. . ."
There was something familiar about that voice ....
Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind
him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching
in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.
"Evening, Rubeus," said Riddle sharply.
The boy slammed the door shut and stood up.
"What yer doin' down here, Tom?"
Riddle stepped closer.
"It's all over," he said. "I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus.
They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop."
"N" at d'yeh -"
"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make
good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -"
"It never killed no one!" said the large boy, backing against the
closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and
clicking.
"Come on, Rubeus," said Riddle, moving yet closer. "The dead girl's
parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make
sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ......
"It wasn't him!" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark
passage. "He wouldn'! He never!"
"Stand aside," said Riddle, drawing out his wand.
His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind
the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall
opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a
long, piercing scream unheard by anyone
A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of
many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his
wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it
scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle
scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the
huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down,
yelling, "NO000000!"
The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself
falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster
in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach.

Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door
opened and Ron came in.
"There you are," he said.
Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.
"What's up?" said Ron, looking at him with concern.
"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty
years ago."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an
unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first
year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden
house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, threeheaded dog he'd christened "Fluffy." And if, as a boy, Hagrid had
heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was
sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probably
thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so
long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs;
Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a
leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would
never have meant to kill anybody.
Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary.
Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what
he'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the
long, circular conversations that followed.
"Riddle might have got the wrong person," said Hermione. "Maybe it
was some other monster that was attacking people . . . ."
"How many monsters d'you think this place can hold?" Ron asked
dully.
"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled," said Harry miserably.
"And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out.
Otherwise, Riddle wouldn't have got his award."
Ron tried a different tack.
"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid,
anyway?"
"But the monster had killed someone, Ron," said Hermione.
"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they
closed Hogwarts," said Harry. "I don't blame him for wanting to stay
here ......
"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Harry?"
"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent," said Harry quickly.
The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the
knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.
"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?"
"That'd be a cheerful visit," said Ron. "'Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have
you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"'
In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid
unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by
with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became
hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had
been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly
Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to
think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves
had finally got bored of his "Oh, Potter, you rotter" song, Ernie
Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping
toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the
Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This
made Professor Sprout very happy.
"The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'll
know they're fully mature," she told Harry. "Then we'll be able to
revive those poor people in the hospital wing."
The second years were given something new to think about during
their Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for
the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.
"it could affect our whole future," she told Harry and Ron as they
pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.
"I just want to give up Potions," said Harry.
"We can't," said Ron gloomily. "We keep all our old subjects, or I'd've
ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts."
"But that's very important!" said Hermione, shocked.
"Not the way Lockhart teaches it," said Ron. "I haven't learned
anything from him except not to set pixies loose."
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and
wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to
choose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with
his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy
sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean
Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up
closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the
subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody's advice but signed up for
everything.
Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon
and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in
wizardry with them. Not that he didn't get any guidance: Percy
Weasley was eager to share his experience.
"Depends where you want to go, Harry," he said. "It's never too early
to think about the future, so Id recommend Divination. People say
Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should
have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community,
particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them -
look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My
brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for
Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry."
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In
the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was
lousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him.
Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood
was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry
barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However,
the training sessions were getting better, or at least
drier, and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to his
dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for
the Quidditch cup had never been better.
But his cheerful mood didn't last long. At the top of the stairs to the
dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.
"Harry - I don't know who did it - I just found -"
Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.
The contents of Harry's trunk had been thrown everywhere. His
cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his
four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside
cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.
Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few
loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the
blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean
swore loudly.
"What happened, Harry?"
"No idea," said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry's robes. All the
pockets were hanging out.
"Someone's been looking for something," said Ron. "Is there anything
missing?"
Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk.
It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it
that he realized what wasn't there.
"Riddle's diary's gone," he said in an undertone to Ron.
"What?"
Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed
him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common
room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting
alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.
Hermione looked aghast at the news.
"But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our
password -"
"Exactly," said Harry.
They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing
breeze.
"Perfect Quidditch conditions!" said Wood enthusiastically at the
Gryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs.
"Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast."
Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering
if the new owner of Riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes.
Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn't
like the idea. He'd have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how
many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He
didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again.
As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his
Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry's
growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he
heard it yet again
"Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear. . ."
He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him
in alarm.
"The voice!" said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. "I just heard it
again - didn't you?"
Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a
hand to her forehead.
"Harry - I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the
library!"
And she sprinted away, up the stairs.
"What does she understand?" said Harry distractedly, still looking
around, trying to tell where the voice had come from.
"Loads more than I do," said Ron, shaking his head.
"But why's she got to go to the library?"
"Because that's what Hermione does," said Ron, shrugging. "When in
doubt, go to the library."
Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people
were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly,
exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.
"You'd better get moving," said Ron. "It's nearly eleven - the match -
"
Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two
Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds,
but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and
as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker. room, his only comfort
was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.
The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver
Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam
Hooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary
yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of
tactics.
Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall
came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an
enormous purple megaphone.
Harry's heart dropped like a stone.
"This match has been cancelled," Professor McGonagall called
through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were
boos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran
toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick.
"But, Professor!" he shouted. "We've got to play - the cup
Gryffindor -"
Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her
megaphone:
"All students are to make their way back to the House common
rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further
information. As quickly as you can, please!"
Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.
"Potter, I think you'd better come with me ......
Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw
Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up
to them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry's surprise,
Professor McGonagall didn't object.
"Yes, perhaps you'd better come, too, Weasley .....
Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about
the match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron
followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the
marble staircase. But they weren't taken to anybody's office this time.
"This will be a bit of a shock," said Professor McGonagall in a
surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. "There has
been another attack ... another double attack."
Harry's insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall
pushed the door open and he and Ron entered. .
Madam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly
hair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentally
asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed
next to her was
"Hermione!" Ron groaned.
Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.
"They were found near the library," said Professor McGonagall. "I
don't suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next
to them ......
She was holding up a small, circular mirror.
Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.
"I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower," said Professor
McGonagall heavily. "I need to address the students in any case.
"All students will return to their House common rooms by six o'clock
in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time.
You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use
the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch
training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more
evening activities."
The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor
McGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment
from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked
voice, "I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is
likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these
attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know
anything about them to come forward."
She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the
Gryffindors began talking immediately.
"That's two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one
Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, " said the Weasley twins' friend Lee
Jordan, counting on his fingers. "Haven't any of the teachers noticed
that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming
from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - why
don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out?" he roared, to nods and
scattered applause.
Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn't
seem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.
"Percy's in shock," George told Harry quietly. "That Ravenclaw girl -
Penelope Clearwater - she's a prefect. I don't think he thought the
monster would dare attack a prefect."
But Harry was only half-listening. He didn't seem to be able to get rid
of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved
out of stone. And if the culprit wasn't caught soon, he was looking at a
lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in
because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the
school closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.
"What're we going to do?" said Ron quietly in Harry's ear. "D'you
think they suspect Hagrid?"
"We've got to go and talk to him," said Harry, making up his
mind. "I can't believe it's him this time, but if he set the monster
loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets,
and that's a start."
"But McGonagall said we've got to stay in our tower unless we're
in class -"
"I think," said Harry, more quietly still, "it's time to get my dad's
old cloak out again."
Harry had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and silvery
Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of
the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They
went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Sea
mus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally
fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over
themselves.
The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors
wasn't enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night sev
eral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teach
ers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs,
staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak
didn't stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly
tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot
where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at
almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they
reached the oak front doors and eased them open.
It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows
of Hagrid's house and pulled off the cloak only when they were
right outside his front door.
Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found
themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang
the boarhound barked loudly behind him.
"Oh," he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. "What're
you two doin' here?"
"What's that for?" said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they
stepped inside.
"Nothin' - nothin' - " Hagrid muttered. "I've bin expectin' doesn'
matter - Sit down - I'll make tea -"
He hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly
extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then
smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.
"Are you okay, Hagrid?" said Harry. "Did you hear about
Hermione?"
"Oh, I heard, all righ'," said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.
He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both
large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and
was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud
knock on the door.
Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged
panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over
themselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that they
were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once
more.
"Good evening, Hagrid."
It was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was
followed by a second, very odd-looking man.
The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and
was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a
scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm
he carried a lime-green bowler.
"That's Dad's boss!" Ron breathed. "Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of
Magic!"
Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.
Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs
and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.
"Bad business, Hagrid," said Fudge in rather clipped tones. "Very bad
business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone
far enough. Ministry's got to act."
"I never," said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. "You know I
never, Professor Dumbledore, sir -"
"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,"
said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.
"Look, Albus," said Fudge, uncomfortably. "Hagrid's record's against
him. Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have been
in touch -"
"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help
in the slightest," said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire
Harry had never seen before.
"Look at it from my point of view," said Fudge, fidgeting with his
bowler. "I'm under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing
something. If it turns out it wasn't Hagrid, he'll be back and no more
said. But I've got to take him. Got to. Wouldn't be doing my duty -"
"Take me?" said Hagrid, who was trembling. "Take me where?"
"For a short stretch only," said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes. "Not
a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught,
you'll be let out with a full apology -"
"Not Azkaban?" croaked Hagrid.
Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.
Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry's turn for an elbow in the ribs;
he'd let out an audible gasp.
Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut, swathed in a long black
traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to
growl.
"Already here, Fudge," he said approvingly. "Good, good. . ."
"What're you doin' here?" said Hagrid furiously. "Get outta my house!"
"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being
inside your - er - d'you call this a house?" said Lucius Malfoy, sneering
as he looked around the small cabin. "I simply called at the school and
was told that the headmaster was here."
"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?" said Dumbledore.
He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.
"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore," said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll
of parchment, "but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside.
This is an Order of Suspension - you'll find all twelve signatures on it.
I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks have
there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate,
there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what
an awful loss that would be to the school."
"Oh, now, see here, Lucius," said Fudge, looking alarmed,
"Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now
"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for
the governors, Fudge," said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. "And as
Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -"
"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can't stop them," said Fudge, whose
upper lip was sweating now, "I mean to say, who can?"
"That remains to be seen," said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. "But as
all twelve of us have voted -"
Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.
'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they
agreed, Malfoy, eh?" he roared.
"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble
one of these days, Hagrid," said Mr. Malfoy. "I would advise you not
to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all."
"Yeh can' take Dumbledore!" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the
boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. "Take him away, an' the
Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin' next!"
"Calm yourself, Hagrid," said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at
Lucius Malfoy.
"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside
-"
"But -" stuttered Fudge.
"No!"growled Hagrid.
Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's
cold gray ones.
"However," said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that
none of them could miss a word, "you will find that I will
ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake
alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into
bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle
windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't
look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle,
where things were so horribly wrong.
Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now
barred from the hospital wing.
"We're taking no more chances," Madam Pomfrey told them severely
through a crack in the infirmary door. "No, I'm sorry, there's every
chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . ."
With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the
sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned
windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school
that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through
the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.
Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself "I will
only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will
always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it." But what good
were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help,
when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?
Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the
trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to
follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly)
by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't
allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle
in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students
seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by
teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.
One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the
atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting
around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy.
Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions
lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when,
sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe
and Goyle.
"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of
Dumbledore," he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. "I told you
he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever
had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't
want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won't last long,
she's only filling in ......
Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's
empty seat and cauldron.
"Sir," said Malfoy loudly. "Sir, why don't you apply for the
headmaster's job?"
"Now, now, Malfoy," said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thinlipped smile. "Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the
governors. I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough."
"Yeah, right," said Malfoy, smirking. "I expect you'd have Father's
vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're the
best teacher here, sir -"
Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not
spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his
cauldron.
"I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by
now," Malfoy went on. "Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity
it wasn't Granger -"
The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's last
words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags
and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.
"Let me at him," Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms.
"I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare
hands -"
"Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology," barked Snape over
the class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean
bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only
safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and
they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the
greenhouses.
The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing
from their number, Justin and Hermione.
Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian
Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the
compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan.
Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, "I just want to say,
Harry, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you. I know you'd never attack
Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We're all in
the same boat now, and, well -"
He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.
Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as
Harry and Ron.
"That Draco Malfoy character," said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs,
"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he? D'you know, I think
he might be Slytherin's heir."
"That's clever of you," said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven
Ernie as readily as Harry.
"Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry?" Ernie asked.
"No," said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.
A second later, Harry spotted something.
Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side
of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the
shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand
with his pruning shears.
"Ouch! What're you -"
Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes
screwed up against the sun.
"Oh, yeah," said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. "But we can't
follow them now -"
Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously.
Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued
their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would
end up.
"Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . ."
And Ron looked even unhappier about that.
At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their
Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind
the others so they could talk out of earshot.
"We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again," Harry told Ron. "We
can take Fang with us. He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid,
he might be some help."
"Right," said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers.
"Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the
forest?" he added as they took their usual places at the back of
Lockhart's classroom.
Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, "There are good
things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...
Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had
entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.
Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every
other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but
Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.
"Come now," he cried, beaming around him. "Why all these long
faces?"
People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.
"Don't you people realize," said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though
they were all a bit dim, "the danger has passed! The culprit has been
taken away -"
"Says who?" said Dean Thomas loudly.
"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken
Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,"
said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one
made two.
"Oh, yes he would," said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.
"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid's arrest than you
do, Mr. Weasley," said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.
Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in
midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.
"We weren't there, remember?" Harry muttered.
But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always
thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business
was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw
Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face. Instead he
contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight.
Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the
empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his
resolve, and he nodded.
The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days,
because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had no -
where else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result
that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight.
Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after
dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to
clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of
Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in
Hermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying
to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight
when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.
Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors
closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and
climbing through the portrait hole.
It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the
teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on
the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any
creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.
"'Course," said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass,
"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those
spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they
were moving in that sort of general direction, but. . ."
His voice trailed away hopefully.
They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank
windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy
at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle
with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from
a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.
Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no
need for it in the pitch-dark forest.
"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk," said Harry, patting his leg, and
Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the
edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.
Harry took out his wand, murmured, "Lumos!" and a tiny light
appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for
signs of spiders.
"Good thinking," said Ron. "Id light mine, too, but you know - it'd
probably blow up or something ......
Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary
spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the
trees.
"Okay," Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, "I'm ready. Let's
go."
So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves,
they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed
the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked
behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for
noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the
trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were
no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark,
they saw their spider guides leaving the path.
Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but
everything outside his little sphere of was pitch-black. He had
never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly
remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time
he'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in
a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.
Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward,
crushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang's nose.
"What d'you reckon?" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just
make out, reflecting the light from his wand.
"We've come this far," said Ron.
So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees.
They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and
stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could
feel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop,
so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.
They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes
snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they
noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the
trees were as thick as ever.
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry
and Ron jump out of their skins.
"What?" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and
gripping Harry's elbow very hard.
"There's something moving over there," Harry breathed. "Listen ...
sounds like something big ......
They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was
snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.
"Oh, no," said Ron. "Oh, no, oh, no, oh -"
"Shut up," said Harry frantically. "It'll hear you."
"Hear me?" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. "It's already heard
Fang!"
The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they
stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then
silence.
"What d'you think it's doing?" said Harry.
"Probably getting ready to pounce," said Ron.
They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.
"D'you think it's gone?" Harry whispered.
"Dunno -"
Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the
darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes.
Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and
yelped even louder.
"Harry!" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief "Harry, it's our
car!"
"What?"
"Come on!"
Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping,
and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.
Mr. Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of
thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As
Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him,
exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.
"It's been here all the time!" said Ron delightedly, walking around the
car. "Look at it. The forest's turned it wild . . . ."
The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud.
Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own.
Fang didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could
feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed
his wand back into his robes.
"And we thought it was going to attack us!" said Ron, leaning against
the car and patting it. "I wondered where it had gone!"
Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders,
but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.
"We've lost the trail," he said. "C'mon, let's go and find them."
Ron didn't speak. He didn't move. His eyes were fixed on a point
some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was
livid with terror.
Harry didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking
noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around
the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging
facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron's
legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next
moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.
Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on
six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below
a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of
the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very
heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from
a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if
he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car
in the clearing.
He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only
knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the
leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck
sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of
a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars
shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.
Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below.
Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy,
gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way
down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of
the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their
pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron
and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn't howling anymore,
but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt.
His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes
were popping.
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was
saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his
pincers with every word he spoke.
"Aragog!" it called. "Aragog!"
And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a
small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of
his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was
milky white. He was blind.
"What is it?" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
"Men," clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
"Is it Hagrid?" said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes
wandering vaguely.
"Strangers," clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
"Kill them," clicked Aragog fretfully. "I was sleeping ......
"We're friends of Hagrid's," Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have
left his chest to pound in his throat.
Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.
Aragog paused.
"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before," he said slowly.
"Hagrid's in trouble," said Harry, breathing very fast. "That's why
we've come."
"In trouble?" said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern
beneath the clicking pincers. "But why has he sent you?"
Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn't
think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as
calmly as he could.
"They think,, up at the school, that Hagrid's been setting a a -
something on students. They've taken him to Azkaban."
Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the
sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause,
except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear.
"But that was years ago," said Aragog fretfully. "Years and years ago.
I remember it well. That's why they made him leave the school. They
believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the
Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the
Chamber and set me free."
"And you ... you didn't come from the Chamber of Secrets?" said
Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.
"I!" said Aragog, clicking angrily. "I was not born in the castle. I come
from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg.
Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in
the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid
is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and
blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in
the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me
a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through
Hagrid's goodness ......
Harry summoned what remained of his courage.
"So you never - never attacked anyone?"
"Never," croaked the old spider. "It would have been my instinct, but
out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the
girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any
part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like
the dark and the quiet ......
"But then ... Do you know what did kill that girl?" said Harry.
"Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again -"
His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the
rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted
all around him.
"The thing that lives in the castle," said Aragog, "is an ancient creature
we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded
with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the
school."
"What is it?" said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
"We do not speak of it!" said Aragog fiercely. "We do not name it! I
never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he
asked me, many times."
Harry didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders
pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of tamng. He
was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders
continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.
"We'll just go, then," Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing
leaves rustling behind him.
"Go?" said Aragog slowly. "I think not ......
"But - but -"
"My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our
midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid."
Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall
of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.
Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there
were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting,
a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the
hollow.
Mr. Weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring,
its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto
their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to
a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.
"Get Fang!" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the
boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of
the car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn't touch the accelerator
but the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off,
hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and
they were soon crashing through the forest, branches
whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the
widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.
Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent
scream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore.
"Are you okay?"
Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak.
They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly
in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they
squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees
thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.
The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the
windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung
himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry
opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house, tail
between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron
seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked
and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into
the forest and disappeared from view.
Harry went back into Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang
was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside
again, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.
"Follow the spiders," said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve.
"I'll never forgive Hagrid. We're lucky to be alive."
"I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his," said Harry.
"That's exactly Hagrid's problem!" said Ron, thumping the wall of the
cabin. "He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're
made out, and look where it's got him! A cell in Azkaban!" He was
shivering uncontrollably now. "What was the point of sending us in
there? What have we found out, Id like to know?"
"That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets," said Harry,
throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him
walk. "He was innocent."
Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard
wasn't his idea of being innocent.
As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure
their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar.
They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the
marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where
watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the
Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into
glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to
their dormitory.
Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry,
however, didn't feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter,
thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.
The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought,
sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn't
want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it
was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known
what was in the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his
pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.
He couldn't see what else they could do. They had hit dead end
everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of
Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same
person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time.
There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about
what Aragog had said.
He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last
hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.
"Ron," he hissed through the dark, "Ron -"
Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and saw
Harry.
"Ron -that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,"
said Harry, ignoring Neville's snufing snores from the corner. "What
if she never left the bathroom? What if she's still there?"
Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he
understood, too.
"You don't think - not Moaning Myrtle?"
A ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just
three toilets away," said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,
"and we could've asked her, and now. . ."
It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their
teachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom,
moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be
almost impossible.
But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove
the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks.
Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their
exams would start on the first of June, one week from today.
howled Seamus Finnigan. "We're still getting exams?"
There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wand
slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professorr
McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned,
frowning, to Seamus.
"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to
receive your education," she said sternly. "The exams will therefore
take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard."
Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be
exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous
muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl
even more darkly.
"Professor Dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school running
as normally as possible, she said. "And that, I need hardly point out,
means finding out how much you have learned this year.
Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be
turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn't
seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.
Ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in the
Forbidden Forest.
"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?" he asked Harry, holding
up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.
Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made
another announcement at breakfast.
"I have good news," she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling
silent, erupted.
"Dumbledore's coming back!" several people yelled joyfully.
"You've caught the Heir of Slytherin!" squealed a girl at the
Ravenclaw table.
"Quidditch matches are back on!" roared Wood excitedly.
When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said,
"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for
cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who
have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may
well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that
this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit."
There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the
Slytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy
hadn't joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he'd looked in
days.
"It won't matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!" he said to Harry.
"Hermione'll probably have all the answers when they wake her up!
Mind you, she'll go crazy when she finds out we've got exams in three
days' time. She hasn't studied. It might be kinder to leave her where
she is till they're over."
Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She
looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were
twisting in her lap.
"What's up?" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.
Ginny didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor
table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone,
though he couldn't think who.
"Spit it out," said Ron, watching her.
Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking
backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did
when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.
"I've got to tell you something," Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at
Harry.
"What is it?" said Harry.
Ginny looked as though she couldn't find the right words.
"What?"said Ron.
Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned
forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him.
"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen
something? Someone acting oddly?"
Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley
appeared, looking tired and wan.
"If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, Ginny. I'm starving, I've
only just come off patrol duty."
Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave
Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat
down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.
"Percy!" said Ron angrily. "She was just about to tell us some-' thing
important!"
Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.
"What sort of thing?" he said, coughing.
"I just asked her if she'd seen anything odd, and she started to say
"Oh - that - that's nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets," said
Percy at once.
"How do you know?" said Ron, his eyebrows raised.
"Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day
when I was - well, never mind - the point is, she spot
ted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to
anybody. I must say, I did think she'd keep her word. It's nothing,
really, Id just rather -"
Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.
"What were you doing, Percy?" said Ron, grinning. "Go on, tell us, we
won't laugh."
Percy didn't smile back.
"Pass me those rolls, Harry, I'm starving."
Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without
their help, but he wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle
if it turned up - and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were
being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.
Lockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed,
only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly
convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely
down the corridors. His hair wasn't as sleek as usual; it seemed he
had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.
"Mark my words," he said, ushering them around a corner. "The first
words out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be It was
Hagrid.' Frankly, I'm astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all
these security measures are necessary."
(ti agree, sir," said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.
"Thank you, Harry, said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a
long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. "I mean, we teachers have quite
enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and
standing guard all night ......
"That's right," said Ron, catching on. "Why don't you leave us here, sir,
we've only got one more corridor to go -"
"You know, Weasley, I think I will," said Lockhart. "I really should go
and prepare my next class -"
And he hurried off.
"Prepare his class," Ron sneered after him. "Gone to curl his hair,
more like."
They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted
down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle's
bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their
brilliant scheme
"Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?"
It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin
lines.
"We were -we were-" Ron stammered. "We were going to - to go and
see -"
"Hermione," said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked
at him.
"We haven't seen her for ages, Professor," Harry went on hurriedly,
treading on Ron's foot, "and we thought we'd sneak into the hospital
wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er,
not to worry -"
Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment,
Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in
a strangely croaky voice.
"Of course," she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her
beady eye. "Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends
of those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes,
Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor
Binns where you've gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my
permission."
Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'd
avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard
Professor McGonagall blow her nose.
"That," said Ron fervently, "was the best story you've ever come up
with."
They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam
Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall's permission to visit
Hermione.
Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.
"There's just no point talking to a Petrified. person," she said, and they
had to admit she had a point when they'd taken their seats next to
Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn't have the faintest inkling
that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside
cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.
"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?" said Ron, looking sadly
at Hermione's rigid face. "Because if he sneaked up on them all, no
one'll ever know . .....
But Harry wasn't looking at Hermione's face. He was more interested
in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending
closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.
Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this
out to Ron.
"TG and get it out," Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he
blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey's view.
It was no easy task. Hermione's hand was clamped so tightly around
the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept
watch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes,
the paper came free.
It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out
eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.
Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land,
there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk,
known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may
reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born
from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are
most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk
has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall
suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal
enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is
fatal to it.
And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry
recognized as Hermione's. Pipes.
It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.
"Ron," he breathed. "This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the
Chamber's a basilisk - a giant serpent! That why I've been hearing
that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It's because
I understand Parseltongue . . . ."
Harry looked up at the beds around him.
"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one's died -
because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his
camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got
Petrified. Justin . . . Justin must've seen the basilisk through Nearly
Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again .
. . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a
mirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a
basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to
look around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her
mirror - and -"
Rods jaw had dropped.
"And Mrs. Norris?" he whispered eagerly.
Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.
"The water. . ." he said slowly. "The flood from Moaning Myrtle's
bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection . . . ."
He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it,
the more it made sense.
. . The crowing of the rooster . . . is fatal to it"! he read aloud. "Hagrid's
roosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn't want one anywhere
near the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spidersflee before it.! It
all fits!"
"But how's the basilisk been getting around the place?" said Ron. "A
giant snake . . . Someone would've seen. . ."
Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the
foot of the page.
"Pipes," he said. "Pipes . . . Ron, it's been using the plumbing. I've
been hearing that voice inside the walls . . . ."
Ron suddenly grabbed Harry's arm.
"The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!" he said hoarsely.
"What if it's a bathroom? What if it's in -"
Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, "said Harry.
They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able
to believe it.
"This means," said Harry, "I can't be the only Parselmouth in
the school. The Heir of Slytherin's one, too. That's how he's been
controlling the basilisk."
"What're we going to do?" said Ron, whose eyes were flashing.
"Should we go straight to McGonagall?"
"Let's go to the staff room," said Harry, jumping up. "She'll be
there in ten minutes. It's nearly break."
They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging
around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted
staff room. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs.
Harry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down.
But the bell to signal break never came.
Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGon
agall's voice, magically magnified.
students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teach
ers return to the staff room. Immediately, please. "
Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron.
"Not another attack? Not now?"
"What'll we do?" said Ron, aghast. "Go back to the dormitory?"
"No," said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of
wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers' cloaks. "In here. Let's hear
what it's all about. Then we can tell them what we've found out."
They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of
people moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open.
From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the
teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled,
others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.
"It has happened," she told the silent staff room. "A student has been
taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself."
Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her
hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard
and said, "How can you be sure?"
"The Heir of Slytherin," said Professor McGonagall, who was very
white, "left another message. Right underneath the first one.
skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. "'
Professor Flitwick burst into tears.
"Who is it?" said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a
chair. "Which student?"
"Ginny Weasley," said Professor McGonagall.
Harry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside
him.
"We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow," said
Professor McGonagall. "This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore
always said. . ."
The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment,
Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and
he was beaming.
"So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?"
He didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him
with something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward.
"Just the man," he said. "The very man. A girl has been snatched by
the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your
moment has come at last."
Lockhart blanched.
"That's right, Gilderoy," chipped in Professor Sprout. "Weren't you
saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to
the Chamber of Secrets is?"
"I - well, I -"sputtered Lockhart.
"Yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?"
piped up Professor Flitwick.
"D-did I? I don't recall -"
"I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a
crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested," said Snape. "Didn't
you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should
have been given a free rein from the first?"
Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.
"I - I really never - you may have misunderstood -"
"We'll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy," said Professor McGonagall.
"Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We'll make sure everyone's
out of your way. You'll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. A
free rein at last."
Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the
rescue. He didn't look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was
trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked
weak-chinned and feeble.
"V very well," he said. "I'll - I'll be in my office, getting getting ready."
And he left the room.
"Right," said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared,
"that's got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should
go and inform their students what has happened. Tell them the
Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. Will the
rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their
dormitories."
The teachers rose and left, one by one.
It was probably the worst day of Harry's entire life. He, Ron, Fred,
and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room,
unable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn't there. He had gone
to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his
dormitory.
No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor
Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and
George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.
"She knew something, Harry," said Ron, speaking for the first time
since they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. "That's why
she was taken. It wasn't some stupid thing about Percy at all., She'd
found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why
she was -" Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. "I mean, she was a pureblood. There can't be any other reason."
Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was
the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do.
Anything.
"Harry" said Ron. "D'you think there's any chance at all she's not - you
know
Harry didn't know what to say. He couldn't see how Ginny could still
be alive.
"D'you know what?" said Ron. "I think we should go and see
Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He's going to try and get into the
Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it's a
basilisk in there."
Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because he
wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around
them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that
nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left
through the portrait hole.
Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart's office.
There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear
scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps.
Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the
door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart's eyes
peering through it.
"Oh - Mr. Potter - Mr. Weasley -" he said, opening the door a bit
wider. "I'm rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -"
"Professor, we've got some information for you," said Harry. "We
think it'll help you."
"Er - well - it's not terribly -" The side of Lockhart's face that they
could see looked very uncomfortable. "I mean - well all right -"
He opened the door and they entered.
His office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks
stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnightblue, had
been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into
the other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now
crammed into boxes on the desk.
"Are you going somewhere?" said Harry.
"Er, well, yes," said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from
the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. "Urgent call -
unavoidable - got to go -"
"What about my sister?" said Ron jerkily.
"Well, as to that - most unfortunate -" said Lockhart, avoiding their
eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents
into a bag. "No one regrets more than I -"
"You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!" said Harry.
"You can't go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!"
"Well - I must say - when I took the job -" Lockhart muttered, now
piling socks on top of his robes. "nothing in the job description - didn't
expect -"
"You mean you're running away?" said Harry disbelievingly. "After all
that stuff you did in your books -"
"Books can be misleading," said Lockhart delicately.
"You wrote them!" Harry shouted.
"My dear boy," said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry.
"Do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as
well if people didn't think Id done all those things. No one wants to
read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a
village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No
dress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee
had a harelip. I mean, come on -"
"So you've just been taking credit for what a load of other people have
done?" said Harry incredulously.
"Harry, Harry," said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, "it's not
nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had
to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed to
do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they
wouldn't remember doing it. If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's
my Memory Charms. No, it's been a lot of work, Harry. It's not all
book signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you
have to be prepared for a long hard slog."
He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.
"Let's see," he said. "I think that's everything. Yes. Only one thing
left."
He pulled out his wand and turned to them.
"Awfully sorry, boys, but I'll have to put a Memory Charm on you
now. Can't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. Id never
sell another book -"
Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his,
when Harry bellowed, "Expelliarmus!"
Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew
high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.
"Shouldn't have let Professor Snape teach us that one," said Harry
furiously, kicking Lockhart's trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at
him, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.
"What d'you want me to do?" said Lockhart weakly. "I don't know
where the Chamber of Secrets is. There's nothing I can do."
"You're in luck," said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint.
"We think we know where it is. And what's inside it. Let's go."
They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs,
along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the
door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was
shaking.
Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.
"Oh, it's you," she said when she saw Harry. "What do you want this
time?"
"To ask you how you died," said Harry.
Myrtle's whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had
never been asked such a flattering question.
"Ooooh, it was dreadful," she said with relish. "It happened right in
here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. Id hidden because
Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked,
and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said
something funny. A different language, I think it must have been.
Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I
unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then -"
Myrtle swelled importantly, her face shining. "I died."
"How?" said Harry.
"No idea," said Myrtle in hushed tones. "I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I
was floating away . . . ." She looked dreamily at Harry. "And then I
came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see.
Oh, she was sorry she'd ever laughed at my glasses."
"Where exactly did you see the eyes?" said Harry.
"Somewhere there," said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in
front of her toilet.
Harry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a
look of utter terror on his face.
It looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, inside
and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratched
on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.
"That tap's never worked," said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it.
"Harry," said Ron. "Say something. Something in Parseltongue."
"But -" Harry thought hard. The only times he'd ever managed to
speak Parseltongue were when he'd been faced with a real snake. He
stared hard at the tiny- engraving, trying to imagine it was real.
"Open up," he said.
He looked at Ron, who shook his head.
"English," he said.
Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive.
If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were
moving.
"Open up," he said.
Except that the words weren't what he heard; a strange hissing had
escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and
began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact,
sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide
enough for a man to slide into.
Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind
what he was going to do.

"I'm going down there," he said. .
He couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to the
Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance
that Ginny might be alive.
"Me too," said Ron.
There was a pause.
"Well, you hardly seem to need me," said Lockhart, with a shadow
of his old smile. "I'll just -"
He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed
their wands at him.
"You can go first," Ron snarled.
White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.
"Boys," he said, his voice feeble. "Boys, what good will it do?"
Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs
into the pipe.
"I really don't think -" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push,
and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself
slowly into the pipe, then let go.
It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see
more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs,
which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew
that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons.
Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.
And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen
when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the
end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel
large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his
feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry
stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.
"We must be miles under the school," said Harry, his voice echoing in
the black tunnel.
"Under the lake, probably," said Ron, squinting around at the dark,
slimy walls.
All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.
"Lumos!" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. "C'mon," he
said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping
loudly on the wet floor.
The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead.
Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.
"Remember," Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward,
"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . .....
But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound
they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be
a rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that
it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to
imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the
way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.
"Harry - there's something up there -" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing
Harry's shoulder.
They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something
huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving.
"Maybe it's asleep," he breathed, glancing back at the other two.
Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to
look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.
Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see,
Harry edged forward, his wand held high.
The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green,
lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had
shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.
"Blimey," said Ron weakly.
There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart's
knees had given way.
"Get up," said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.
Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the
ground.
Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up,
panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his
face.
"The adventure ends here, boys!" he said. "I shall take a bit of this
skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl,
and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her
mangled body - say good-bye to your memories!"
He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled,
"Obliviate!"
The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his
arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out
of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to
the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall
of broken rock.
"Ron!" he shouted. "Are you okay? Ron!"
"I'm here!" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall. "I'm
okay - this git's not, though - he got blasted by the wand
There was a dull thud and a loud "ow!" It sounded as though Ron had
just kicked Lockhart in the shins.
"What now?" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. "We can't get
through - it'll take ages ......
Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it.
He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by
magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the whole
tunnel caved in?
There was another thud and another "ow!" from behind the rocks.
They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of
Secrets for hours .... Harry knew there was only one thing to do.
"Wait there," he called to Ron. "Wait with Lockhart. I'll go on.... If I'm
not back in an hour. . .
There was a very pregnant pause,
"I'll try and shift some of this rock," said Ron, who seemed to be trying
to keep his voice steady. "So you can - can get back through. And,
Harry -"
"See you in a bit," said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his
shaking voice.
And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.
Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone.
The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body was
tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what
he'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another
bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were
carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.
Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend
these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.
He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the
emerald eyes seemed to flicker.
"Open, "said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.
The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly
out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.
e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering
stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a
ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd,
greenish gloom that filled the place.
His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence.
Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And
where was Ginny?
He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine
columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls.
He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest
sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes
seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the
stomach, he thought he saw one stir.
Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the
Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.
Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It
was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to
the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two
enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between
the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red
hair.
"tinny!" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees.
"tinny - don't be dead - please don't be dead -" He flung his wand
aside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was
white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn't
Petrified. But then she must be
"Ginny, please wake up," Harry muttered desperately, shaking her.
Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side.
"She won't wake," said a soft voice.
Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.
A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar,
watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though
Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was
no mistaking him
"Tom - Tom Riddle?"
Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face.
"What d'you mean, she won't wake?" Harry said desperately. "She's
not - she's not -?"
"She's still alive," said Riddle. "But only just."
Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years
ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day
older than sixteen.
"Are you a ghost?" Harry said uncertainly.
"A memory," said Riddle quietly. "Preserved in a diary for fifty years.
He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open
there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's
bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but
there were more pressing matters to deal with.
"You've got to help me, Tom," Harry said, raising Ginny's head again.
"We've got to get her out of here. There's a basilisk ... I don't know
where it is, but it could be along any moment .... Please, help me -1)
Riddle didn't move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off
the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.
But his wand had gone.
"Did you see -?"
He looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry's wand
between his long fingers.
"Thanks," said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.
A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth. He continued to stare at
Harry, twirling the wand idly.
"Listen," said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead
weight. "We've got to go! If the basilisk comes -"
"It won't come until it is called," said Riddle calmly.
Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any
longer.
"What d'you mean?" he said. "Look, give me my wand, I might need it
-"
Riddle's smile broadened.
"You won't be needing it," he said.
Harry stared at him.
"What d'you mean, I won't be -?"
"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter," said Riddle. "For the
chance to see you. To speak to you."
"Look," said Harry, losing patience, "I don't think you get it. We're in
the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -"
"We're going to talk now," said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he
pocketed Harry's wand.
Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here
....
"How did Ginny get like this?" he asked slowly.
"Well, that's an interesting question," said Riddle pleasantly. "And quite
a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is
because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible
stranger."
"What are you talking about?" said Harry.
"The diary," said Riddle. diary. Little Ginny's been writing in it for
months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how
her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with
secondhand robes and books, how" -Riddle's eyes glinted "how she
didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . ."
All the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. There
was an almost hungry look in them.
"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an elevenyear-old girl," he went on. "But I was patient. I wrote back. I was
sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's ever
understood me like you, Tom .... I'm so glad I've got this diary to
confide in .... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . .
Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs
stand up on the back of Harry's neck.
"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I
needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to
be exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of
her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more
powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding
Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul
back into her. . ."
"What d'you mean?" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.
" Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?" said Riddle softly. "Ginny
Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school
roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the
Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat.
"No," Harry whispered.
"Yes," said Riddle, calmly. "Of course, she didn't know what she was
doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her
new diary entries ... far more interesting, they became .... Dear Tom,"
he recited, watching Harry's horrified face, think I'm losing my
memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how
they got there. Dear Tom, l can't remember what 1 did on the night of
Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front.
Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself. I think he
suspects me... There was another attack today and I don't know where I was.
Tom, what am I going to do? I think I'm
going mad... I think I'm the one attacking everyone, Tom!"
Harry's fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his Palms.
"it took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her
diary," said Riddle. "But she finally became suspicious and tried to
dispose of it. And that's where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I
couldn't have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have
picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet . .
. ."
"And why did you want to meet me?" said Harry. Anger was coursing
through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.
"Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry," said Riddle. "Your
whole fascinating history. " His eyes roved over the lightning scar on
Harry's forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. "I knew I must
find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided
to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your
trust -"
"Hagrid's my friend," said Harry, his voice now shaking. "And you
framed him, didn't you? I thought you made a mistake, but -"
Riddle laughed his high laugh again.
"It was my word against Hagrid's, Harry. Well, you can imagine how
it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor
but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student ...
on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week,
trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the
Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I admit, even I was surprised how
well the plan worked. I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn't
possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out
everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret
entrance... as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!
"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think
Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dipper to keep Hagrid and train
him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed ....
Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers
did ......
"I bet Dumbledore saw right through you," said Harry, his teeth gritted.
"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid
was expelled," said Riddle carelessly. "I knew it wouldn't be safe to
open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn't going
to waste those long years Id spent searching for it. I decided to leave
behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that
one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and
finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
"Well, you haven't finished it," said Harry triumphantly. "No one's died
this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will
be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -"
"Haven't I already told you," said Riddle quietly, "that killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target
has been -you."
Harry stared at him.
"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was
opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you
with the diary, you see, and panicked. "What if you found out how to
work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I
told you who'd been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited
until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I
must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin's
heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would
go to any lengths to solve the mystery --
particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had
told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak
Parseltongue ....
"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down
here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But
there isn't much life left in her .... She put too much into the diary, into
me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last .... I have been waiting for
you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you'd come. I have many
questions for you, Harry Potter."
"Like what?" Harry spat, fists still clenched.
"Well," said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, "how is it that you a skinny boy
with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while
Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?"
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
"Why do you care how I escaped?" said Harry slowly. "Voldemort was
after your time ......
"Voldemort," said Riddle softly, "is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter . . . ."
He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it
through the air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name
rearranged themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
"You see?" he whispered. "It was a name I was already using at
Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I
was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? I, in whose
veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my
mother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who
abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his
wife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a
name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,
when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!"
Harry's brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle,
at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry's own
parents, and so many others .... At last he forced himself to -,peak.
"You're not," he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
"Not what?" snapped Riddle.
"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world," said Harry, breathing fast.
"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the
world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were
strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore
saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you
now, wherever you're hiding these days -"
The smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very ugly
look
"Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of
me!" he hissed.
"He's not as gone as you might think!" Harry retorted. He was
speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than
believing it to be true
Riddle opened his mouth, but froze.
Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare
down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was
eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry's scalp and
made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size.
Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating
inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.
A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music
to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a
peacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged
bundle.
A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the
ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his
shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a
long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.
The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry's cheek,
gazing steadily at Riddle.
"That's a phoenix said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.
"Fawkes?" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden claws
squeeze his shoulder gently
"And that -" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had
dropped, "that's the old school Sorting Hat -"
So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry's
feet.
Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark
chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once
"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old
hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?"
Harry didn't answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the
Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for
Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.
"To business, Harry," said Riddle, still smiling broadly. "Twice - in your
past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How
did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk," he added
softly, "the longer you stay alive."
Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand.
He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would
be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right ... but the longer Riddle
stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and in the
meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle's outline was becoming
clearer, more solid .... If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle,
better sooner than later.
"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,"
said Harry abruptly. "I don't know myself But I know why you
couldn't kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common
Muggle-born mother," he added, shaking with suppressed rage. "She
stopped you killing me. And I've seen the real you, I saw you last
year. You're a wreck. You're barely alive. That's where all your
power got you. You're in hiding. You're ugly, you're foul -"
Riddle's face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. "So.
Your mother died to save you. Yes, that's a powerful countercharm. I
can see now ... there is nothing special about you, after all. I
wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all.
Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by
Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts
since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike ... but
after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That's
all I wanted to know."
Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle's
twisted smile was widening again.
"Now, Harry, I'm going to teach you a little lesson. Let's match the
powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous
Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . ."
He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked
away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Ridthe stop
between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin,
high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and
hissed - but Harry understood what he was saying ....
"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. "
Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his
shoulder.
Slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw
his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.
And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth. Something
was slithering up from its depths. 3 1
Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut
his eyes tight he felt Fawkes' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight.
Harry wanted to shout, "Don't leave me!" but what chance did a
phoenix have against the king of serpents?
Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it
shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could
almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin's mouth.
Then he heard Riddle's hissing voice:
"Kill him. "
The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body
slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry
began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way -
Voldemort was laughing
Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent
was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming
There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then
something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall.
Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing,
something thrashing wildly off the pillars
He couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what
was going on.
The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk,
had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving
drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his
eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.
Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping
furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers
Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a
sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake's tail
thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his
eyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its
eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the
phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting
in agony.
"NO!" Harry heard Riddle screaming. "LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE
THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL
HIM. KILL HIMI"
The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was
circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its
scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.
"Help me, help me," Harry muttered wildly, "someone - anyone
The snake's tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked.
Something soft hit his face.
The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms. Harry
seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his
head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk's tail swung
over him again.
Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat.
Please help me
There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though
an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.
Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head,
almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed
the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard
beneath it.
A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle
glittering with rubies the size of eggs.
"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU.
SNIFF -- SMELL HIM."
Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk's head was falling, its body
coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the
vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough
to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin,
glittering, venomous -
It lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged
again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side. He raised the sword
in both his hands -
The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw
his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof
of the serpent's mouth -
But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just
above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and
deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over
sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.
Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading
poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it
was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from
the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood
soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving
in a whirl of dull color.
A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws
beside him.
"Fawkes," said Harry thickly. "You were fantastic, Fawkes . . . ."
He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's
fang had pierced him.
He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in
front of him.
"You're dead, Harry Potter," said Riddle's voice above him. "Dead.
Even Dumbledore's bird knows it. Do you see what he's doing, Potter?
He's crying."
Harry blinked. Fawke's head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears
were trickling down the glossy feathers.
"I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time.
I'm in no hurry."
Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.
"So ends the famous Harry Potter," said Riddle's distant voice. "Alone
in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by
the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of
borrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew
he must . . . ."
If this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad.
Even the pain was leaving him ....
But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be
coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was
Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry's arm. A pearly patch of tears was
shining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound
"Get away, bird," said Riddle's voice suddenly. "Get away from him -
I said, get away --"
Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at
Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a
whirl of gold and scarlet.
"Phoenix tears. - ." said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry's arm. "Of
course ... healing powers ... I forgot. . ."
He looked into Harry's face. "But it makes no difference. In fact, I
prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter ... you and me....
He raised the wand
Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and
something fell into Harry's lap -- the diary.
For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it.
Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to
do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him
and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.
There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the
diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor.
Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then
He had gone. Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there
was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing
from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right
through it.
Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as
though he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered
together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved
the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth.
Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was
stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused
eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in
his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great,
shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.
"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't
say it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I ddiddt mean to -- R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over -- and - how
did you kill that -- that thing? W-where's Riddle? The last thing I rremember is him coming out of the diary --"
" It's all right," said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the
fang hole, "Riddle's finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C'mon,
Ginny, let's get out of here --"
"I'm going to be expelled!" Ginny wept as Harry helped her
awkwardly to her feet. "I've looked forward to coming to Hogwarts
ever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'll
Mum and Dad say?"
Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance.
Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of
the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.
Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.
After a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of
slowly shifting rock reached Harry's ears.
"Ron!" Harry yelled, speeding up. "Ginny's okay! I've got her!"
He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to
see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to
make in the rock fall.
"Ginny!" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull
her through first. "You're alive! I don't believe it! What happened?"
How - what -- where did that bird come from?"
Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.
"He's Dumbledore's," said Harry, squeezing through himself
"How come you've got a sword?" said Ron, gaping at the glittering
weapon in Harry's hand.
"I'll explain when we get out of here," said Harry with a sideways
glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.
"But --"
"Later," Harry said shortly. He didn't think it was a good idea to tell
Ron yet who'd been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny,
anyway. "Where's Lockhart?"
"Back there," said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the
tunnel toward the pipe. "He's in a bad way. Come and see."
Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow
in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe.
Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.
"His memory's gone," said Ron. "The Memory Charm backfired. Hit
him instead of us. Hasn't got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who
we are. I told him to come and wait here. He's a danger to himself"
Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.
"Hello," he said. "Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?"
"No," said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.
Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.
"Have you thought how we're going to get back up this?" he said to
Ron.
Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry
and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the
dark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked
uncertainly at him.
"He looks like he wants you to grab hold. . ." said Ron, looking
perplexed. "But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -"
"Fawkes," said Harry, "isn't an ordinary bird." He turned quickly to the
others. "We've got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron's hand.
Professor Lockhart --"
"He means you," said Ron sharply to Lockhart.
"You hold Ginny's other hand --"
Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took
hold of the back of Harry's robes, and Harry reached out and took
hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers.
An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body
and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward
through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him,
saying, "Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!" The chill air was
whipping through Harry's hair, and before he'd stopped enjoying the
ride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor of
Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the
sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.
Myrtle goggled at them.
"You're alive," she said blankly to Harry.
"There's no need to sound so disappointed," he said grimly, wiping
flecks of blood and slime off his glasses.
"Oh, well ... Id just been thinking ... if you had died, you'd have been
welcome to share my toilet," said Myrtle, blushing silver.
"Urgh!" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted
corridor outside. "Harry! I think Myrtle's grown fond of you! You've
got competition, Ginny!"
But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny's face.
"Where now?" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed.
Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They
strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside
Professor McGonagall's office.
Harry knocked and pushed the door open.
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
REWARD
or a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart
stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry's case)
blood. Then there was a scream.
"Ginny!"
It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire.
She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of
them flung themselves on their daughter.
Harry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was
standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall,
who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes
went whooshing past Harry's ear and settled on Dumbledore's
shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs.
Weasleys tight embrace.
"You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?"
"I think we'd all like to know that," said Professor McGonagall weakly.
Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then
walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the
rubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle's diary.
Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an
hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the
disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was
hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the
spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last
victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning
Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of
Secrets might be in her bathroom ....
"Very well," Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, "so
you found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred school
rules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did
you all get out of there alive, Potter?"
So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told
them about Fawkes's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving
him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided
mentioning Riddle's diary -- or Ginny. She was standing with her
head against Mrs. Weasley's shoulder, and tears were still coursing
silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in
panic. Riddle's diary didn't work anymore .... How could they prove
it had been he who'd made her do it all?
Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the
firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.
interests me most," said Dumbledore gently, "is how Lord
Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is
currently in hiding in the forests of Albania."
Relief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over Harry. "Wwhat's that?" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. "YouKnow-Who?
En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny's not ... Ginny hasn't been ... has she?"
"It was this diary," said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to
Dumbledore. "Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen . . . ."
Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his
long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.
"Brilliant," he said softly. "Of course, he was probably the most
brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen." He turned around to the
Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.
"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom
Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He
disappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank
so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our
kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that
when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable.
Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever,
handsome boy who was once Head Boy here."
"But, Ginny," said Mrs. Weasley. "What's our Ginny got to do with -
with -- him?"
"His d-diaryl" Ginny sobbed. "I've b-been writing in it, and he's been
w-writing back all year --"
"tinny!" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. "Haven't I taught you
anything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can
think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain? Why didn't
you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like
that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic
"I d-didn't know," sobbed Ginny. "I found it inside one of the books
Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and
forgotten about it --"
"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,"
Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. "This has been a terrible
ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards
than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort." He strode over
to the door and opened it. "Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming
mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up," he added,
twinkling kindly down at her. "You will find that Madam Pomfrey is
still awake. She's just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the
basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment."
"So Hermione's okay!" said Ron brightly.
"There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny," said Dumbledore.
Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking
deeply shaken.
"You know, Minerva," Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to
Professor McGonagall, "I think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask
you to go and alert the kitchens?"
"Right," said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door.
"I'll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?"
"Certainly," said Dumbledore.
She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What
exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely -
surely - they weren't about to be punished?
"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if
you broke any more school rules, said Dumbledore.
Ron opened his mouth in horror.
"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our
words," Dumbledore went on, smiling. "You will both receive Special
Awards for Services to the School and -- let me see - yes, I think two
hundred points apiece for Gryffindor."
Ron went as briglitly pink as Lockhart's valentine flowers and closed
his mouth again.
"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this
dangerous adventure," Dumbledore added. "Why so modest,
Gilderoy?"
Harry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He
turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room,
still wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him,
Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.
"Professor Dumbledore," Ron said quickly, "there was an accident
down in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart --"
"Am I a professor?" said Lockhart in mild surprise. "Goodness. I
expect I was hopeless, was I?"
"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired," Ron
explained quietly to Dumbledore.
"Dear me," said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver
mustache quivering. "Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!"
"Sword?" said Lockhart dimly. "Haven't got a sword. That boy has,
though." He pointed at Harry. "He'll lend you one."
"Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?"
Dumbledore said to Ron. "Id like a few more words with Harry .....
Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and
Harry as he closed the door.
Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.
"Sit down, Harry," he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably
nervous.
"First of all, Harry, I want to thank you," said Dumbledore, eyes
twinkling again. "You must have shown me real loyalty down in the
Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you."
He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee.
Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.
"And so you met Tom Riddle," said Dumbledore thoughtfully. "I
imagine he was most interested in you . . . . "
Suddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of
his mouth.
"Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I'm like him. Strange likenesses,
he said ......
"Did he, now?" said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from
under his thick silver eyebrows. "And what do you think, Harry?"
"I don't think I'm like him!" said Harry, more loudly than he'd intended.
"I mean, I'm -- I'm in Gryffindor, I'm . . ."
But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.
"Professor," he started again after a moment. "The Sorting Hat told me
Id -- Id have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin's
heir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue ....
"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry," said Dumbledore calmly,
"because Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining ancestor
of Salazar Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much
mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he
gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I'm sure ....
"Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?" Harry said, thunderstruck.
"It certainly seems so."
"So I should be in Slytherin," Harry said, looking desperately into
Dumbledore's face. "The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin's power in
me, and it --"
"Put you in Gryffindor," said Dumbledore calmly. "Listen to me, Harry.
You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his handpicked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue -
resourcefulness - determination -- a certain disregard for rules," he
added, his mustache quivering again. "Yet the Sorting Hat placed you
in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think."
"It only put me in Gryffindor," said Harry in a defeated voice, "because
I asked not to go in Slytherin . . . ."
"said Dumbledore, beaming once more. "Which makes you
very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what
we truly are, far more than our abilities." Harry sat motionless in his
chair, stunned. "If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in
Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this."
Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall's desk, picked
up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry
turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the
name engraved just below the hilt.
Godric Gryffindor
"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,"
said Dumbledore simply.
For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled open
one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quill
and a bottle of ink.
What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down
to the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need our gamekeeper
back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too," he
added thoughtfully. "We'll be needing a new Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don't
we?"
Harry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for the
handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced
back off the wall.
Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his
legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.
"Good evening, Lucius," said Dumbledore pleasantly.
Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room.
Dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak,
a look of abject terror on his face.
The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to
finish cleaning Mr. Malfoys shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out
in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his
usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing
apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon
Dumbledore.
"So!" he said "You've come back. The governors suspended you, but
you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts."
"Well, you see, Lucius," said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, "the
other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like
being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They'd heard that
Arthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here
at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after
all. Very strange tales they told me, too .... Several of them seemed
to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn't
agree to suspend me in the first place."
Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of
fury.
"So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?" he sneered. "Have you
caught the culprit?"
"We have," said Dumbledore, with a smile.
"Well?"said Mr. Malfoy sharply. "Who is it?"
"The same person as last time, Lucius," said Dumbledore. "But this
time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means
of this diary."
He held up the small black book with the large hole through the
center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching
Dobby.
The elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed
meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr.
Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.
"I see. . . " said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.
"A clever plan," said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr.
Malfoy straight in the eye. "Because if Harry here" --Mr. Malfoy shot
Harry a swift, sharp look -- "and his friend Ron hadn't discovered
this book, why -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all
the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn't
acted of her own free will ......
Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.
"And imagine," Dumbledore went on, "what might have happened
then .... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood
families. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle
Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and -
killing Muggle-borns .... Very fortunate the diary was discovered,
and Riddle's memories wiped from it. "Who knows what the
consequences might have been otherwise ......
Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.
"Very fortunate," he said stiffly.
And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary,
then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.
And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby
backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.
"Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr.
Malfoy?" said Harry.
Lucius Malfoy rounded on him.
"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?" he said.
"Because you gave it to her," said Harry. "In Flourish and Blotts.
You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary
inside it, didn't you?"
He saw Mr. Malfoy's white hands clench and unclench.
"Prove it," he hissed.
"Oh, no one will be able to do that," said Dumbledore, smiling at
Harry. "Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On
the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any
more of Lord Voldemort's old school things. If any more of them find
their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will
make sure they are traced back to you ......
Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right
hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead,
he turned to his house-elf
"We're going, Dobby!"
He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him,
he kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing with
pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment,
thinking hard. Then it came to him -
"Professor Dumbledore," he said hurriedly. "Can I give that diary
back to Mr. Malfoy, please?"
"Certainly, Harry," said Dumbledore calmly. "But hurry. The feast,
remember ......
Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear
Dobby's squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly,
wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his
shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it.
Then he ran down the dark corridor.
He caught up with them at the top of the stairs.
"Mr. Malfoy," he gasped, skidding to a halt, "I've got something for
you --"
And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy's hand.
"What the --?"
Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked
furiously from the ruined book to Harry.
You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days,
Harry Potter," he said softly. "They were meddlesome fools, too.
He turned to go.
"Come, Dobby. I said, come."
But Dobby didn't move. He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy
sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.
"Master has given a sock," said the elf in wonderment. "Master gave
it to Dobby."
"What's that?" spat Mr. Malfoy. "What did you say?"
"Got a sock," said Dobby in disbelief. "Master threw it, and Dobby
caught it, and Dobby -- Dobby is free. "
Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf Then he lunged at
Harry.
"You've lost me my servant, boy!"
But Dobby shouted, "You shall not harm Harry Potter!"
There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He
crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap
on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his
wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.
"You shall go now," he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy.
"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now."
Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair
of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
"Harry Potter freed Dobby!" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry,
moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes.
"Harry Potter set Dobby free!"
"Least I could do, Dobby," said Harry, grinning. "Just promise never
to try and save my life again."
The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.
"I've just got one question, Dobby," said Harry as Dobby pulled on
Harry's sock with shaking hands. "You told me all this had nothing to
do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --"
"It was a clue, sir," said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was
obvious. "Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed
his name, could be freely named, you see?"
"Right," said Harry weakly. "Well, Id better go. There's a feast, and
my friend Hermione should be awake by now .....
Dobby threw his arms around Harry's middle and hugged him.
"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!" he sobbed.
"Farewell, Harry Potter!"
And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.
Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like
this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all
night. Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running
toward him, screaming "You solved it! You solved it!" or Justin
hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand and
apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half
past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they
were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundred
points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year
running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to

tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat ("Oh,
no!" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately,
Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the
fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few
of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.
"Shame," said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. "He was
starting to grow on me."
The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.
Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences -
Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled ("but we've
had plenty of practice at that anyway," Ron told a disgruntled
Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor.
Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned
the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other
hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.
Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to
themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they
were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding
Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster fireworks,
and practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very
good at it.
They were almost at King's Cross when Harry remembered
something.
"Ginny - what did you see Percy doing, that he didn't want you to tell
anyone?"
"Oh, that," said Ginny, giggling. "Well - Percy's got a girlfriend." Fred
dropped a stack of books on George's head.
"What?"
"It's that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater," said Ginny.
"That's who he was writing to all last summer. He's been meeting her
all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty
classroom one day. He was so upset when she was -- you know -
attacked. You won't tease him, will you?" she added anxiously.
"Wouldn't dream of it," said Fred, who was looking like his birthday
had come early.
"Definitely not," said George, sniggering.
The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.
Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron
and Hermione.
"This is called a telephone number," he told Ron, scribbling it twice,
tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. "I told your dad
how to use a telephone last summer - he'll know. Call me at the
Dursleys', okay? I can't stand another two months with only Dudley
to talk to ......
"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?" said
Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging
toward the enchanted barrier. "When they hear what you did this
year?"
"Proud?" said Harry. "Are you crazy? All those times I could've
died, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious ......
And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle
world.
THE END

Harry Potter
and
the Prisoner of
Azkaban
J.K. Rowling
CHAPTER ONE
OWL POST
Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he
hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another,
he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret,
in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the
blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand
and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot)
propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his
eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something
that would help him write his essay, "Witch Burning in the Fourteenth
Century Was Completely Pointless discuss."
The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed
his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer
to the book, and read:
Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly
afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.
On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning
had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic
Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while
enjoying
a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being
burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than
fortyseven times in various disguises.
Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow
for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he
unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write,
pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys
heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he'd
probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the
rest of the summer.
The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that
Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia,
and
their son, Dudley, were Harry's only living relatives. They were
Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry's
dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never
mentioned under the Dursleys' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle
Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible,
they would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they
had been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding
out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to
lock
away Harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of
the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,
because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.
One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was
for Harry's least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be
delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry
had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. While
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front
garden to admire Uncle Vernon's new company car (in very loud voices,
so
that the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had crept
downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed
some of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn't
leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he
was studying magic by night.
Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at
the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, all
because he'd received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week
into the school vacation.
Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry's best friends at Hogwarts, came
from
a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry
didn't, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it had
been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.
"Vernon Dursley speaking."
Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard
Ron's voice answer.
"HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I -- WANT -- TO -- TALK -
- TO -- HARRY
-- POTTER!"
Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver
a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled
fury and alarm.
"WHO IS THIS?" he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. "WHO
ARE
YOU?"
"RON -- WEASLEY!" Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle
Vernon were
speaking from opposite ends of a football field. "I'M -- A -- FRIEND --
OF -- HARRY'S -- FROM -- SCHOOL --"
Uncle Vernon's small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to
the spot.
"THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!" he roared, now holding the
receiver at
arm's length, as though frightened it might explode. "I DON'T KNOW
WHAT
SCHOOL YOURE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME
AGAIN! DON'T YOU COME NEAR
MY FAMILY!"
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a
poisonous spider.
The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.
"HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE --
PEOPLE LIKE YOU!" Uncle
Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he'd gotten Harry into trouble, because he
hadn't called again. Harry's other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione
Granger, hadn't been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had
warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the
cleverest witch in Harry's year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well
how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to
say that she went to Hogwarts.
So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long
weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last
one. There was just one very small improvement -- after swearing that he
wouldn't use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been
allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in
because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the
time.
Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen
again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant,
grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late,
Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he'd finish
this essay tomorrow night....
He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from
under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill,
and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose
floorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked the
time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.
It was one o'clock in the morning. Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. He
had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.
Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward
to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. The
Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had no
reason to suppose they would remember this one.
Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig's large, empty cage, to
the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on
his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent
for two nights now. Harry wasn't worried about her: she'd been gone this
long before. But he hoped she'd be back soon -- she was the only living
creature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of him.
Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few
inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it
always had been -- stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes
behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly
visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of
lightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most
extraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten
years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry's parents,
because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been
murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years,
Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing
more
than a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort's curse, instead of killing
him, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had
fled....
But Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering
their
last meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was
lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.
He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring
back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise.
Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry
realized what he was seeing.
Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment,
was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry's
direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a
split second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering
whether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one
of the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was,
leapt aside.
Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third,
which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on
Harry's bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled right
over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once -- his name was Errol, and
he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the
cords around Errol's legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol
to Hedwig's cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of
thanks, and began to gulp some water.
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy
female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked
extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with
her beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join
Errol.
Harry didn't recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew
at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package,
it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved
this owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched
its wings, and took off through the window into the night.
Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol's package, ripped off the
brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first
ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope.
Two pieces of paper fell out -- a letter and a newspaper clipping.
The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily
Prophet, because the people in the black-and-white picture were moving.
Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:
MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE
Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the
Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon
Draw.
A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, "We will be spending the
gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as
a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank."
The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the
start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley
children currently attend.
Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face
as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in
front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tail, balding Mr.
Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white
picture didn't show it) with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of
the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on
his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.
Harry couldn't think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold
more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor. He
picked
up Ron's letter and unfolded it.
Dear Harry,
Happy birthday!
Look, I' really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles
didn't give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn't
have shouted.
It's amazing here in Egypt. Bill's taken us around all the tombs and you
wouldn't believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum
wouldn't let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutant
skeletons in there, of Muggles who'd broken in and grown extra heads and
stuff.
I couldn't believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven
hundred
galleons! Most of it's gone on this trip, but they're going to buy me a
new wand for next year.
Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron's old wand had
snapped. It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to
Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.
We'll be back about a week before term starts and we'll be going up to
London to get my wand and our new books. Any chance of meeting you
there?
Don't let the Muggles get you down!
Try and come to London,
Ron
P.S. Percy's Head Boy. He got the letter last week.
Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his seventh and
final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He had pinned his
Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his
horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.
Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked
like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ron
beneath it.
Harry -- this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there's someone untrustworthy
around, it's supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it's rubbish sold
for wizard tourists and isn't reliable, because it kept lighting up at
dinner last night. But he didn't realize Fred and George had put beetles
in his soup.
Bye --
Ron
Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it stood
quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his
clock. He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the
parcel Hedwig had brought.
Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter,
this time from Hermione.
Dear Harry,
Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I
do hope you're all right.
I'm on holiday in France at the moment and I didn't know how I was going
to send this to you -- what if they'd opened it at customs? -- but then
Hedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got something for
your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there
was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I've been getting it
delivered; it's so good to keep up with what's going on in the wizarding
world), Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ago? I bet
he's learning loads. I'm really jealous -- the ancient Egyptian wizards
were fascinating.
There's some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I've
rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things
I've found out, I hope it's not too long -- it's two rolls of parchment
more than Professor Binns asked for.
Ron says he's going to be in London in the last week of the holidays.
Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope
you can. If not, I'll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September
first!
Love from Hermione
P.S. Ron says Percy's Head Boy. I'll bet Percy's really pleased Ron
doesn't seem too happy about it
Harry laughed as he put Herrmone's letter aside and picked up her
present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a
large book full of very difficult spells -- but it wasn't. His heart
gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black
leather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading Broomstick
Servicing Kit.
"Wow, Hermione!" Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.
There was a large jar of Fleetwood's High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair
of gleaming silver Tall-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on
your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself
Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world -- highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to
be a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a
century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry's
most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it
snapped loudly -- as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything
dangerous
on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn't have a normal person's view of what
was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy
vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon
eggs into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached
for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and
raised it over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the
wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.
And out fell -- a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome
green cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book of
Monsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along
the bed like some weird crab.
"Uh-oh," Harry muttered.
The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly
across the room. Harry followed it stealthily. The book was hiding in
the dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast
asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it.
"Ouch!"
The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still
scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward,
and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the
room next door.
Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling
book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled
out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book
shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it
down on the bed and reached for Hagrid's card.
Dear Harry,
Happy Birthday!
Think you might find this useful for next year. Won't say no more here.
Tell you when I see you. Hope the Muggles are treating you right.
All the best,
Hagrid
It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come
in useful, but he put Hagrid's card up next to Ron's and Hermione's,
grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from
Hogwarts left.
Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the
envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:
Dear Mr. Potter,
Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first.
The Hogwarts Express will leave ftom King's Cross station, platform nine
and three-quarters, at eleven o'clock.
Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain
weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or
guardian to sign.
A list of books for next year is enclosed. Yours sincerely,
Professor M. McGonagall
Deputy Headmistress
Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no
longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends;
he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot
there. But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt
Petunia to sign the form?
He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o'clock in the
morning.
Deciding that he'd worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up,
Harry
got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart
he'd made for himself, counting down the days left until his return to
Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing
his three birthday cards.
Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just
like everyone else -- glad, for the first time in his life, that it was
his birthday.
CHAPTER TWO
AUNT MARGE'S BIG MISTAKE
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys
already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new
television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had
been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the
television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in
the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five
chins wobbling as he ate continually.
Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man
with
very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy
birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry
enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped
himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the
television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:
"... The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A
special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be
reported immediately."
"No need to tell us he's no good," snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over
the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. "Look at the state of him, the
filthy layabout! Look at his hair!"
He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always
been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man
on
the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted,
elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.
The reporter had reappeared.
"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today --"
"Hang on!" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. "You
didn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from! use is that?
Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!"
Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered
intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would
simply
love to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest
woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring,
law-abiding neighbors.
"When will they learn," said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his
large purple fist, "that hanging's the only way to deal with these
people?"
"Very true," said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door's
runner beans.
Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, "I'd
better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge's train gets in at ten."
Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing
Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.
"Aunt Marge?" he blurted out. "Sh -- she's not coming here, is she?"
Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister. Even though she was not a blood
relative of Harry's (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia's sister), he
had been forced to call her "Aunt" all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the
country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She
didn't often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn't bear to leave
her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in
Harry's mind.
At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around
the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at
musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with
a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On
her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had
accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased
Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to
call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still
brought tears of laughter to Dudley's eyes.
"Marge'll be here for a week," Uncle Vernon snarled, 11 and while we're
on the subject" -- he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry -- "we
need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her."
Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching
Harry
being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley's favorite form of
entertainment.
"Firstly," growled Uncle Vernon, "you'll keep a civil tongue in your
head when you're talking to Marge."
"All right," said Harry bitterly, "if she does when she's talking to me.
"Secondly," said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry's
reply, "as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't
want any -- any funny stuff while she's here.
You behave yourself, got me?"
"I will if she does," said Harry through gritted teeth.
"And thirdly," said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his
great purple face, "we've told Marge you attend St. Brutus's Secure
Center for Incurably Criminal Boys."
"What?" Harry yelled.
"And you'll be sticking to that story, boy, or there'll be trouble, spat
Uncle Vernon.
Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon,
hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit -- it
was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him,
including that pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
"Well, Petunia," said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, "I'll
be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?"
"No," said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now
that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.
"Duddy's got to make himself smart for his auntie," said Aunt Petunia,
smoothing Dudley's thick blond hair. "Mummy's bought him a lovely new
bow tie."
Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. "See you in a bit,
then," he said, and he left the kitchen.
Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden
idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed
Uncle Vernon to the front door.
Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.
"I'm not taking you," he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him.
"Like I wanted to come," said Harry coldly. "I want to ask you
something."
Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.
"Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village
sometimes," said Harry.
"So?" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the
door.
"I need you to sign the permission form," said Harry in a rush.
"And why should I do that?" sneered Uncle Vernon.
"Well," said Harry, choosing his words carefully, "it'll be hard work,
pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits --"
"St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!" bellowed Uncle
Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle
Vernon's voice.
"Exactly," said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large,
purple face. "It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make it sound
convincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?"
"You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?" roared Uncle
Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his
ground.
"Knocking the stuffing out of me won't make Aunt Marge forget what I
could tell her," he said grimly.
Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.
"But if you sign my permission form," Harry went on quickly, "I swear
I'll remember where I'm supposed to go to school, and I'll act like a
Mug -- like I'm normal and everything."
Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his
teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.
"Right," he snapped finally. "I shall monitor your behavior carefully
during Marge's visit. If, at the end of it, you've toed the line and
kept to the story, I'll sign your ruddy form."
He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard
that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.
Harry didn't return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his
bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he'd better start
now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday
cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then
he
went to Hedwig's cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig
were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them
both awake.
"Hedwig," he said gloomily, "you're going to have to clear off for a
week. Go with Errol. Ron'll look after you. I'll write him a note,
explaining. And don't look at me like that" -- Hedwig's large amber eyes
were reproachful -- "it's not my fault. It's the only way I'll be
allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione."
Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her
leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling
thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.
But Harry didn't have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia
was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to
welcome their guest.
"Do something about your hair!" Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the
hall.
Harry couldn't see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt
Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she
would be.
All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon's car
pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and
footsteps on the garden path.
"Get the door!" Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.
A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.
On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon:
large, beefy, and purple- faced, she even had a mustache, though not as
bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked
under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.
"Where's my Dudders?" roared Aunt Marge. "Where's my neffy-poo?"
Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his
fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust
the suitcase into Harry's stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized
Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.
Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge's
hugs
because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart,
Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.
"Petunia!" shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a
hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge
bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia's bony cheekbone.
Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.
"Tea, Marge?" he said. "And what will Ripper take?"
"Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer," said Aunt Marge as they all
proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the
suitcase. But Harry wasn't complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt
Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the
spare bedroom, taking as long as he could.
By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied
with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner.
Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked
her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.
"Who's looking after the other dogs, Marge?" Uncle Vernon asked.
"Oh, I've got Colonel Fubster managing them," boomed Aunt Marge.
"He's
retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn't leave
poor old Ripper. He pines if he's away from me."
Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt
Marge's attention to Harry for the first time.
"So!" she barked. "Still here, are you?"
"Yes," said Harry.
"Don't you say yes' in that ungrateful tone," Aunt Marge growled. "It's
damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn't have done it
myself. You'd have gone straight to an orphanage if you'd been dumped on
my doorstep."
Harry was bursting to say that he'd rather live in an orphanage than
with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him.
He
forced his face into a painful smile.
"Don't you smirk at me!" boomed Aunt Marge. "I can see you haven't
improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners
into you." She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said,
"Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?"
"St. Brutus's," said Uncle Vernon promptly. "It's a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases."
"I see," said Aunt Marge. "Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?"
she barked across the table.
"Er --"
Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge's back.
"Yes," said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly,
he added, "all the time."
"Excellent," said Aunt Marge. "I won't have this namby-pamby,
wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good
thrashing is what's needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have
you been beaten often?"
"Oh, yeah," said Harry, "loads of times."
Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes.
"I still don't like your tone, boy," she said. "If you can speak of your
beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren't hitting you hard
enough. Petunia, I'd write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve
the use of extreme force in this boy's case."
Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain;
in any case, he changed the subject abruptly.
"Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner,
eh?"
As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself
thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their
way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other
hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boom
out suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in comparing Harry
with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents
while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn't got a
present too. She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry
such an unsatisfactory person.
"You mustn't blame yourself for the way the boy's turned out, Vernon,"
she said over lunch on the third day. "If there's something rotten on
the inside, there's nothing anyone can do about it."
Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face
was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he told himself
Think about Hogsmeade. Don't say anything. Don't rise
Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.
"It's one of the basic rules of breeding," she said. "You see it all the
time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be
something wrong with the pup --"
At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her
hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered
and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.
"Marge!" squealed Aunt Petunia. "Marge, are you all right?"
"Not to worry," grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin.
"Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster's
the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip..."
But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry
suspiciously, so he decided he'd better skip dessert and escape from the
table as soon as he could.
Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply It had
been a long time since he'd lost control and made something explode. He
couldn't afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn't the
only thing at stake -- if he carried on like that, he'd be in trouble
with the Ministry of Magic.
Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law
to do magic outside school. His record wasn't exactly clean either. Only
last summer he'd gotten an official warning that had stated quite
clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive,
Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.
He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the
way.
Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about
his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started
on
him. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look,
because Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally
subnormal.
At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge's stay arrived. Aunt
Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles
of wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a
single mention of Harry's faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle
Vernon bored them A with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making
company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a
bottle of brandy.
"Can I tempt you, Marge?"
Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very
red.
"Just a small one, then," she chuckled. "A bit more than that... and a
bit more... that's the ticket."
Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping
coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to
disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon's angry little eyes
and knew he would have to sit it out.
"Aah," said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy
glass back down. "Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up
for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after...." She burped
richly and patted her great tweed stomach. "Pardon me. But I do like to
see a healthy-sized boy," she went on, winking at Dudley. "You'll be a
proper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I'll have a spot more
brandy, Vernon...."
"Now, this one here --"
She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook,
he thought quickly.
"This one's got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I
had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it wasWeak. Underbred."
Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure
Reluctant Reversers. "It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the
other day.
Bad blood will out. Now, I'm saying nothing against your family,
Petunia" she patted Aunt Petunia's bony hand with her shovellike one
"but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then
she ran off with a wastrel and here's the result right in front of us."
Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your
broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn't remember what came
next. Aunt Marge's voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle
Vernon's drills.
"This Potter, 5) said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and
splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, "you never told
me what he did?"
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley
had
even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.
"He -- didn't work," said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry.
"Unemployed."
"As I expected!" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and
wiping her chin on her sleeve. "A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy
scrounger who --"
"He was not," said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was
shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life.
"MORE BRANDY!" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He
emptied
the bottle into Aunt Marge's glass. "You, boy," he snarled at Harry. "Go
to bed, go on --"
"No, Vernon," hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny
bloodshot
eyes fixed on Harry's. "Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are
you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect)
--"
'They didn't die in a car crash!" said Harry, who found himself on his
feet.
"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a
burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!" screamed Aunt Marge,
swelling with fury. "You are an insolent, ungrateful little --"
But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as
though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with
inexpressible anger -- but the swelling didn't stop. Her great red face
started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too
tightly for speech -- next second, several buttons had just burst from
her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls -- she was inflating like a
monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband,
each of her fingers blowing up like a salami --
"MARGE!" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt
Marge's
whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was
entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her
hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making
apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking
madly.
"NOOOOOOO!"
Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge's feet and tried to pull her down
again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later,
Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon's leg.
Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading
for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically
open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front
door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up
the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and
birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig's empty cage, and
dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of
the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.
"COME BACK IN HERE!" he bellowed. "COME BACK AND PUT HER
RIGHT!"
But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open,
pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.
"She deserved it," Harry said, breathing very fast. "She deserved what
she got. You keep away from me."
He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.
"I'm going," Harry said. "I've had enough."
And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving
his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig's cage under his arm.
CHAPTER THREE
THE KNIGHT BUS
Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in
Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat
quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic
thumping of his heart.
But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook
him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse
fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with
absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done
serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from
Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage
Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives
weren't swooping down on him where he sat.
Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.
What, was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he
simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and
Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminal
or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were
both
abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them.
He didn't have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold
in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune
his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding
Bank in London. He'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way to
London. Unless...
He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If
he was already expelled (his heart was. now thumping painfully fast), a
bit more magic couldn't hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had
inherited from his father -- what if he bewitched the trunk to make it
feather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak,
and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his
vault and... begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect,
but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying to
explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a
trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.
Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for
the Invisibility Cloak - but before he had found it, he straightened up
suddenly, looking around him once more.
A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was
being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights
shone from any of the large square houses.
He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more,
his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it:
someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage
and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only
it would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or --
something else.
"Lumos," Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand,
almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the
pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door
gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking
outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.
Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand
flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he
landed, hard, in the gutter --
There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his
eyes against a sudden blinding light --
With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second
later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt
exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw
when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which
had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled
The Knight Bus.
For a Split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his
fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and
began to speak loudly to the night.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch
or wizard. just stick out your wand hand, step on board) and we can take
you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor this eve --"
The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of "Harry, who
was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and
scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a
few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large,
protruding ears and quite a few pimples.
"What were you doin' down there?" said Stan, dropping his professional
manner.
"Fell over," said Harry.
"'Choo fall over for?" sniggered Stan.
"I didn't do it on purpose," said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in
his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was
bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned
around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence.
The Knight Bus's headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was
empty.
"'Choo lookin' at?" said Stan.
"There was a big black thing," said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the
gap. "Like a dog... but massive..."
He looked a-round at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling
of unease, Harry saw Stan's eyes move to the scar on Harry's forehead.
"Woss that on your 'ead?" said Stan abruptly.
"Nothing," said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the
Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn't want to make it too
easy for them.
"Woss your name?" Stan persisted.
"Neville Longbottom," said Harry, saying the first name that came into
his head. "So -- so this bus," he went on quickly, hoping to distract
Stan, "did you say it goes anywhere?"
"Yep," said Stan proudly, "anywhere you like, long's it's on land. Can't
do nuffink underwater. 'Ere," he said, looking suspicious again, ,You
did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand 'and, dincha?"
"Yes," said Harry quickly. "Listen, how much would it be to get to
London?"
"Eleven Sickles," said Stan, "but for fifteen you get 'or chocolate, and
for fifteen you get an 'ot water bottle an' a toofbrush in the color of
your choice."
Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and
shoved some gold into Stan's hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk,
with Hedwig's cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.
There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside
the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed,
illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the
rear of the bus muttered, "Not now, thanks, I'm pickling some slugs" and
rolled over in his sleep.
"You 'ave this one," Stan whispered, shoving Harry's trunk under the bed
right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the
steering wheel. "This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This ,is Neville
Longbottom, Ern. "
Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to
Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.
"Take 'er away, Ern," said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to
Ernie's.
There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found
himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus.
Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that
they were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was
watching Harry's stunned face with great enjoyment.
"This is where we was before you flagged us down," he said. "Where are
we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?"
"Ar," said Ernie.
"How come the Muggles don't hear the bus?" said Harry.
"Them!" said Stan contemptuously. "Don' listen properly, do they? Don'
look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don'."
"Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan," said Ern. "We'll be in
Abergavenny
in a minute."
Stan passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase.
Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous.
Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The
Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn't hit anything; lines
of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it
approached and back into position once it had passed.
Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in
a traveling cloak.
"'Ere you go, Madam Marsh," said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the
brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam
Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps.
Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was
another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country
lane,
trees leaping out of the way.
Harry wouldn't have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on
a bus that didn't keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a
time. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to
happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge
off the ceiling yet.
Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with
his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man
with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He
looked strangely familiar.
"That man!" Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. "He was on
the Muggle news!"
Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.
"Sirius Black," he said, nodding. "'Course 'e was on the Muggle news,
Neville, where you been?"
He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry's face,
removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.
"You oughta read the papers more, Neville."
Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:
BLACK STILL AT LARGE
Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in
Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic
confirmed today.
"We are doing all we can to recapture Black," said the Minister of
Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, "and we beg the magical
community
to remain calm."
Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International
Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the
crisis.
"Well, really, I had to, don't you know," said an irritable Fudge.
"Black is mad. He's a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or
Muggle.
I have the Prime Minister's assurance that he will not breathe a word of
Black's true identity to anyone. And let's face it-who'd believe him if
he did?"
While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of
metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community
lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black
murdered thirteen people with a single curse.
Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of
the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he
had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes,
and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.
"Scary-lookin' fing, inee?" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read.
"He murdered thirteen people?" said Harry, handing the page back to
Stan, "with one curse?"
"Yep," said Stan, "in front of witnesses an' all. Broad daylight. Big
trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?"
"Ar," said Ern darkly.
Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look
at Harry.
"Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-'Oo," he said.
"What, Voldemort?" said Harry, without thinking.
Even Stan's pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard
that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.
"You outta your tree?" yelped Stan. "'Choo say 'is name for?"
"Sorry," said Harry hastily. "Sorry, I -- I forgot --"
"Forgot!" said Stan weakly. "Blimey, my 'eart's goin' that fast ..."
"So -- so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?" Harry prompted
apologetically.
"Yeah," said Stan, still rubbing his chest. "Yeah, that's right. Very
close to You-Know-'Oo, they say. Anyway, when little 'Arry Potter got
the better of You-Know-'Oo --"
Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again.
"-- all You-Know-'Oo's supporters was tracked down, wasn't they, Ern?
Most of 'em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-'Oo gone, and they
came
quiet. But not Sirius Black. I 'eard he thought 'e'd be
second-in-command once You-Know-'Oo 'ad taken over.
"Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles
an' Black took out 'is wand and 'e blasted 'alf the street apart, an' a
wizard got it, an' so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. 'Orrible,
eh? An' you know what Black did then?" Stan continued in a dramatic
whisper.
"What?" said Harry.
"Laughed," said Stan. "Jus' stood there an' laughed. An' when
reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, I 'e went wiv em
quiet as anyfink, still laughing 'is 'ead off. 'Cos 'e's mad, inee, Ern?
Inee mad?"
"If he weren't when he went to Azkaban, he will be now," said Ern in his
slow voice. "I'd blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves
him right, mind you ... after what he did...."
"They 'ad a job coverin' it up, din' they, Ern?" Stan said. "'Ole street
blown up an' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ad 'appened,
Ern?"
"Gas explosion," grunted Ernie.
"An' now 'e's out," said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of
Black's gaunt face again. "Never been a breakout from Azkaban before,
'as there, Ern? Beats me 'ow 'e did it. Frightenin', eh? Mind, I don't
fancy 'is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?"
Ernie suddenly shivered.
"Talk about summat else, Stan, there's a good lad. Them Azkaban guards
give me the collywobbles."
Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window
of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn't help imagining
what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights' time.
"'Ear about that 'Arry Potter? Blew up 'is aunt! We 'ad 'im 'ere on the
Knight Bus, di'n't we, Ern? 'E was tryin' I to run for it...."
He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating
Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn't know
anything
about the wizard prison, though everyone he'd ever heard speak of it did
so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent
two months there only last year. Harry wouldn't soon forget the look of
terror on Hagrid's face when he had been told where he was going, and
Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.
The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and
wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and
miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry
had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry's pillow when
the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards
and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper
floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.
Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.
"Right then, Neville," said Stan, clapping his hands, where abouts in
London?"
"Diagon Alley," said Harry.
"Righto," said Stan. "'Old tight, then."
BANG.
They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and
watched
buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus's way.
The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of
hours, go to Gringotts the. moment it opened, then set off -- where, he
didn't know.
Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front
of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay
the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.
"Thanks," Harry said to Ern.
He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig's
cage onto the pavement.
"Well," said Harry. "'Bye then!"
But Stan wasn't paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the
bus) he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.
"There you are, Harry," said a voice.
Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same
time, Stan shouted, "Blimey! Ern, come 'ere! Come 'ere I"
Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a
bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach -- he had walked right into
Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.
Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.
"What didja call Neville, Minister?" he said excitedly.
Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and
exhausted.
"Neville?" he repeated, frowning. "This is Harry Potter."
"I knew it!" Stan shouted gleefully. "Ern! Ern! Guess 'oo Neville is,
Ern! 'E's 'Arry Potter! I can see 'is scar!"
"Yes," said Fudge testily, "well, I'm very glad the Knight Bus picked
Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now..."
Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found
himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a
lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the
wizened, toothless landlord.
"You've got him, Minister!" said Tom. "Will you be wanting anything?
Beer? Brandy?"
"Perhaps a pot of tea," said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry.
There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and
Ern
appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around
excitedly.
"'Ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, Neville?" said Stan,
beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over
Stan's shoulder.
"And a private parlor, please, Tom," said Fudge pointedly.
Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge
toward
the passage that led from the bar.
"'Bye, Neville!" called Stan.
Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and
then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into
life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.
"Sit down, Harry," said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.
Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow
of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside,
then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down
opposite Harry.
"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic."
Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but
as he had been wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak at the time,
Fudge wasn't to know that.
Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and
bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table
between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind
him.
"Well, Harry," said Fudge, pouring out tea, "you've had us all in a
right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and
uncle's house like that! I'd started to think... but you're safe, and
that's what matters."
Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.
"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased
to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss
Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal
Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss
Dursley
has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no
recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done."
Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle
surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his ears,
opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed
it again.
"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?" said
Fudge. "Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but
they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at
Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays."
Harry unstuck his throat.
"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays," he
said, "and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive."
"Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,"
said Fudge in a worried tone. "They are your family, after all, and I'm
sure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down."
It didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to
hear what was going to happen to him now.
"So all that remains," said Fudge, now buttering himself a second
crumpet, "is to decide where you're going to spend the last two weeks of
your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and
"Hang on," blurted Harry. "What about my punishment?"
Fudge blinked. "Punishment?"
"I broke the law!" Harry said. "The Decree for the Restriction of
Underage Wizardry!"
"Oh, my dear boy, we're not going to punish you for a little thing like
that!" cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. "It was an accident!
We don't send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!"
But this didn't tally at all with Harry's past dealings with the
Ministry of Magic.
"Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a
pudding in my uncle's house!" he told Fudge, frowning. "The Ministry of
Magic said I'd be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic
there!"
Unless Harry's eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking
awkward.
"Circumstances change, Harry... We have to take into account... in the
present climate... Surely you don't want to be expelled?"
"Of course I don't," said Harry.
"Well then, what's A the fuss about?" laughed Fudge. "Now, have a
crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom's got a room for you."
Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There was
something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him
at
the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he'd done? And now
Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn't usual for the Minister of
Magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?
Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.
"Room eleven's free, Harry," said Fudge. "I think you'll be very
comfortable. just one thing, and I'm sure you'll understand... I don't
want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon
Alley. And you're to be back here before dark each night. Sure you'll
understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me."
"Okay," said Harry slowly, "but why?"
"Don't want to lose you again, do we?" said Fudge with a hearty laugh.
"No, no... best we know where you are.... I mean..."
Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.
"Well, I'll be off, plenty to do, you know...
"Have you had any luck with Black yet?" Harry asked.
Fudge's finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.
"What's that? Oh, you've heard -- well, no, not yet, but it's only a
matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed... and they are
angrier than I've ever seen them."
Fudge shuddered slightly.
"So, I'll say good-bye."
He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.
"Er -- Minister? Can I ask you something?"
"Certainly," said Fudge with a smile.
"Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my
aunt and uncle didn't sign the permission form. D'you think you could
--?"
Fudge was looking uncomfortable.
"Ah," he said. "No, no, I'm very sorry, Harry, but as I'm not your
parent or guardian --"
"But you I re the Minister of Magic," said Harry eagerly. "If you gave
me permission
"No, I'm sorry, Harry, but rules are rules," said Fudge flatly.
'Perhaps You'll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think
it's best if you don't... yes... well, I'll be off Enjoy your stay,
Harry."
And with a last smile and shake of Harry's hand, Fudge left the room.
Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.
"If you'll follow me, Mr. Potter," he said, "I've already taken your
things up..."
Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a
brass
number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him.
Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak
furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the
wardrobe -
"Hedwig!" Harry gasped.
The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry's arm.
"Very smart owl you've got there, chuckled Tom. "Arrived about five
minutes after you did. If there's anything you need, Mr. Potter, don't
hesitate to ask."
He gave another bow and left.
Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig.
The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue
to cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry
could hardly believe that he'd left Privet Drive only a few hours ago,
that he wasn't expelled, and that he was now facing two completely
Dursley-free weeks.
"It's been a very weird night, Hedwig," he yawned.
And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows
and fell asleep.
CHAPTER FOUR
THE LEAKY CAULDRON
It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never
before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he
fancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in
Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most
fascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break
his word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked
watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for
a day's shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest
article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs;
and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of
raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit,, and stand back
as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were
showing one another their purchases ( " it , s a lunascope, old boy --
no more messing around with moon charts, see?") or else discussing the
case of Sirius Black ("personalty, I won't let any of the children out
alone until he's back in Azkaban"). Harry didn't have to do his homework
under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the bright
sunshine outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his
essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart
from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free
sundaes every half an hour.
Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver
Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to
exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He
had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts,
and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to
stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a
wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a
nasty-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a
point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the
galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to
take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry's
resolution most appeared in his favorite shop, Quality Quidditch
Supplies, a week after he'd arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.
Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged
his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards
until he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the
most
magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life.
"Just come out -- prototype --" a square-jawed wizard was telling his
companion.
"It's the fastest broom in the world, isn't it, Dad?" squeaked a boy
younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father's arm.
"Irish International Side's Just put in an order for seven of these
beauties!" the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. "And they're
favorites for the World Cup!"
A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign
next to the broom:
THE FIREBOLT
THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART PACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAMLINED, SUPERFINE
HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH
AND HAND- NUMBERED
WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY
SELECTED BIRCH TWIG
IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC
PERFECTION, GIVING THE
FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT
PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS
AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS
AND INCORPORATES AN
UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.
Price on request... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the
Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole
life -- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nim bus Two
Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the
Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn't ask for
the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at
the Firebolt.
There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the
Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his
school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he
visited Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones.
Most
important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include
those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and
Divination.
Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of
the usual display of gold- embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs,
there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred
copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying
everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in
furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.
Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the
first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book
for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had
said
it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether
Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.
As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward
him.
"Hogwarts?" he said abruptly. "Come to get your new books?"
"Yes," said Harry, "I need --"
"Get out of the way," said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry
aside. He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large,
knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the Monster
Books' cage.
"Hang on," said Harry quickly, "I've already got one of those."
"Have you?" A look of enormous relief spread over the manager's face.
"Thank heavens for that. I've been bitten five times already this
morning --"
A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had seized a
third and were pulling it apart.
"Stop it! Stop it!" cried the manager, poking the walking stick through
the bars and knocking the books apart. "I'm never stocking them again,
never! It's been bedlam! I thought we'd seen the worst when we bought
two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility -cost a
fortune, and we never found them.... Well... is there anything else I
can help you with?"
"Yes," said Harry, looking down his booklist, "I need Unfogging the
Future by Cassandra Vablatsky."
"Ah, starting Divination, are you?" said the manager, stripping off his
gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a
corner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was stacked with
volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against
Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.
"Here you are,,' said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to
take down a thick, black- bound book. "Unfogging the Future. Very good
guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods - palmistry, crystal
balls, bird entrails.
But Harry wasn't listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which
was among a display on a small table: Death Omens.- What to Do When
You
Know the Worst Is Coming.
"Oh, I wouldn't read that if I were you," said the manager lightly,
looking to see what Harry was staring at. "You'll start seeing death
omens everywhere. It's enough to frighten anyone to death. "
But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a
black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly
familiar...
The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry's hands.
"Anything else?" he said.
"Yes," said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog's and dazedly
consulting his booklist. "Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration and
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three."
Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new
books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron,
hardly
noticing where he was going and bumping into several people.
He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books
onto his bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and
sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the
unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd
below in Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the
basin.
"It can't have been a death omen," he told his reflection defiantly. "I
was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent.... It was
probably just a stray dog...."
He raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat
"You're fighting a losing battle there, dear," said his mirror in a
vvheezy voice.
As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a
sign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in
Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus
Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch
Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the
real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish
and Blotts. Harry didn't stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid
his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-looking
grandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that he'd pretended to be
Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.
Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at
least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got
up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just
wondering where he'd have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he
turned.
"Harry! HARRY!"
They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice
Cream Parlor -- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Her,,one very brown,
both waving frantically at him.
"Finally!" said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. "We went to the
Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to Flourish and
Blotts, and Madam Malkin's, and --"
"I got all my school stuff last week," Harry explained. "And how come
You knew I'm staying at the Leaky Cauldron?" "Dad," said Ron simply.
Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have
heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.
"Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?" said Hermione in a very
serious voice.
"I didn't mean to," said Harry, while Ron roared with laughter. "I just
-- lost control."
"It's not funny, Ron," said Hermione sharply. "Honestly, I'm amazed
Harry wasn't expelled."
"So am I," admitted Harry. "Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be
arrested." He looked at Ron. "Your dad doesn't know why Fudge let me
off, does he?"
"Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it?" shrugged Ron, still chuckling.
"Famous Harry Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd
do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they'd have to dig me up first,
because Mum would've killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this
evening. We're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can
come to King's Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione's there as well!"
Hermione nodded, beaming. "Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning
with
all my Hogwarts things."
"Excellent!" said Harry happily. "So, have you got all your new books
and stuff?"
"Look at this," said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and
opening it. "Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one
unicorn tail-hair. And we've got all our books --" He pointed at a large
bag under his chair. "What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant
nearly cried when we said we wanted two."
"What's all that, Hermione?" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three
bulging bags in the chair next to her.
,,Well, I'm taking more new subjects than you, aren't IF' said Hermione.
"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures,
Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies --"
"What are you doing Muggle Studies for?" said Ron, rolling his eyes at
Harry. "You're Muggle- born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You
already
know all about Muggles!"
"But it'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of
view," said Hermione earnestly.
"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?" asked
Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.
"I've still got ten Galleons," she said, checking her purse. "It's my
birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get
myself
an early birthday present."
"How about a nice book? said Ron innocently.
"No, I don't think so," said Hermione composedly. "I really want an owl.
I mean, Harry's got Hedwig and you've got Errol --"
"I haven't," said Ron. "Errol's a family owl. All I've got is Scabbers."
He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. "And I want to get him checked
over," he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. "I
don't think Egypt agreed with him."
Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop
to his whiskers.
"There's a magical creature shop just over there," said Harry, who knew
Diagon Alley very well by now. "You could see if they've got anything
for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl,"
So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical
Menagerie.
There wasn't much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages.
It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants Of these cages were
all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the
counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts,
so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.
A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead
blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was
glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly
up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing
into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there
were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny
custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a
vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping
game using their long, bald tails.
The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter.
"It's my rat," he told the witch. "He been a bit off-color ever since I
brought him back from Egypt."
"Bang him on the counter," said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black
spectacles out of her pocket.
Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the
cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled
to the wire for a better took.
Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he
had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to
the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.
"Hm," said the witch, picking up Scabbers. "How old is this rat?"
"Dunno," said Ron. "Quite old. He used to belong to my brother."
"What powers does he have?" said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.
"Er --" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace
of interesting powers. The witchs eyes moved from Scabbers's tattered
left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.
"He's been through the mill, this one," she said.
"He was like that when Percy gave him to me," said Ron defensively.
"An ordinary common or garden rat like this can't be expected to live
longer than three years or so," said the witch. "Now, if you were
looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of
these --"
She indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron
muttered, "Show-offs."
"Well, if you Don't want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,"
said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red
bottle.
"Okay," said Ron. "How much -- OUCH!"
Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of
the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself,
spitting madly, at Scabbers.
"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!" cried the witch, but Scabbers, shot from
between
her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then
scampered for the door.
"Scabbers!" Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him; Harry
followed.
It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge
under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed
the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaging
his head.
"What was that?"
"It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger," said Harry.
"Where's Hermione?"
"Probably getting her owl
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical
Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn't carrying an owl.
Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
"You bought that monster?" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
"He's gorgeous, isn't he?" said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat's ginger fur was
thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face
looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a
brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was
purring contentedly in Hermione's arms.
"Herinione, that thing nearly scalped me!" said Ron.
"He didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks?" said Hermione.
"And what about Scabbers?" said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. "He needs rest and relaxation! How's he going to get it with
that thing around?"
"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic," said Hermione, slapping
the small red bottle into Ron's hand. "And stop worrying, Crookshanks
will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what's the
problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he'd been in there for ages;
no one wanted him."
"Wonder why," said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky
Cauldron.
They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily prophet.
"Harry!" he said, smiling as he looked up. "How are you?"
"Fine, thanks," said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley
with A their shopping.
Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture
of Sirius Black staring up at him.
"They still haven't caught him, then?" he asked.
"No," said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. "They've pulled us all
off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so
far."
"Would we get a reward if we caught him?" asked Ron. "It'd be good to
get some more money --"
"Don't be ridiculous, Ron," said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection
looked very strained. "Black's not going to be caught by a
thirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get him back,
You mark my words."
At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags
and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start
their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the
Weasleys' youngest child and only girl, Ginny.
Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more
heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he
had
saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red
and muttered "hello" without looking at him. Percy, however, held out
his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, "Harry.
How nice to see you.
"Hello, Percy," said Harry, trying not to laugh.
I hope you're well?" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather
like being introduced to the mayor.
"Very well, thanks --"
"Harry!" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply.
"Simply splendid to see you, old boy --"
"Marvelous," said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in
turn. "Absolutely spiffing."
Percy scowled.
"That's enough, now," said Mrs. Weasley.
"Mum!" said Fred as though he'd only just spotted her and seizing her
hand too. "How really corking to see you --"
"I said, that's enough," said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in
an empty chair. "Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you've heard our exciting
news?" She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy's chest.
"Second Head Boy in the family!" she said, swelling with pride.
"And last," Fred muttered under his breath.
I don't doubt that," said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. "I notice
they haven't made you two prefects."
"What do we want to be prefects for?" said George, looking revolted at
the very idea. "It'd take all the fun out of life."
Ginny giggled.
"Yo u want to set a better example for your sister!" snapped Mrs.
Weasley.
"Ginny's got other brothers to set her an example, Mother," said Percy
loftily. "I'm going up to change for dinner..."
He disappeared and George heaved a sigh.
"We tried to shut him in a pyramid," he told Harry. "But Mum spotted
us."
Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put
three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and
Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.
"How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?" asked Fred as they
dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.
"The Ministry's providing a couple of cars," said Mr. Weasley.
Everyone looked up at him.
"Why?" said Percy curiously.
"It's because of you, Perce," said George seriously. "And there'll be
little flags on the hoods, with HB on them"
"-- for Humongous Bighead," said Fred.
Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.
"Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?" Percy asked again, in a
dignified voice.
"Well, as we haven't got one anymore," said Mr. Weasley,
"-- and as I work there, they're doing me a favor --"
His voice was casual, but Harry couldn't help noticing that Mr.
Weasley's ears had gone red, just like Ron's did when he was under
Pressure.
"Good thing, too," said Mrs. Weasley briskly. "Do you realize how much
luggage you've all got between you? A nice sight you'd be on the Muggle
Underground.... You are all packed, aren't you?"
"Ron hasn't put all his new things in his trunk yet," said Percy, in a
long-suffering voice. "He's dumped them on my bed."
"You'd better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won't have much
time
in the morning," Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at
Percy.
After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made
their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next
day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and
locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and
went to see what was going on.
The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.
"It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing
"I haven't touched it, all right?" Ron roared back.
"What's up?" said Harry.
"My Head Boy badge is gone," said Percy, rounding on Harry.
"So's Scabbers's rat tonic," said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk
to look. "I think I might've left it in the bar --"
"You're not going anywhere till you've found my badge!" yelled Percy.
"I'll get Scabbers's stuff, I'm packed," Harry said to Ron, and he went
downstairs.
Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark,
when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A
second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs.
Weasleys'. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he'd heard them
arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move
closer
to the parlor door.
"--makes no sense not to tell him," Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly.
"Harry's got a right to know. I've tried to tell Fudge, but he insists
on treating Harry like a child. He's thirteen years old and --"
"Arthur, the truth would terrify him!" said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. "Do
you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him?
For heaven's sake, he's happy not knowing!"
"I don't want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!"
retorted Mr. Weasley. "You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering
off by themselves -- they've ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice! But
Harry mustn't do that this year! When I think what could have happened
to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn't picked
him up, I'm prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry
found him."
"But he's not dead, he's fine, so what's the point
"Molly, they say Sirius Black's mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever
enough to escape from Azkaban, and that's supposed to be impossible.
It's been three weeks, and no one's seen hide nor hair of him, and I
don't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearer
catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we
know for sure is what Black's after
"But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts."
"We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of
Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts."
"But no one's really sure that Black's after Harry
There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged
his
fist on the table.
"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn't report it in
the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to
Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks been
talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: 'He's at
Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts.' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants
Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring
You-Know-Who back to pow er. Black lost everything the night Harry
stopped You- Know-Who, and he's had twelve years alone in Azkaban to
brood on that...."
There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to
hear more.
"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you're
forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don't think anything could hurt Harry at
Hogwarts while Dumbledore's headmaster. I suppose he knows about all
this?"
"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards
stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He
wasn't happy about it, but he agreed."
"Not happy? Why shouldn't he be happy, if they're there to catch Black?"
"Dumbledore isn't fond of the Azkaban guards," said Mr. Weasley
heavily.
"Nor am 1, if it comes to that... but when you're dealing with a wizard
like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd rather
avoid."
"If they save Harry then I will never say another word against them,
said Mr. Weasley wearily. "It's late, Molly, we'd better go up...."
Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the
passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few
seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing
the stairs.
The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at
earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's bedroom door
close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.
Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving
with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron's room
in search of his badge.
"We've got it," Fred whispered to Harry. "We've been improving it."
The badge now read Bighead Boy.
Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself
in his room and lay down on his bed.
So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been
lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He'd made
Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards
to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them
all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry
until he was on the train.
Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why
he didn't feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people
with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be
panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree
wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was
wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn't people always say
that
Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of?
Surely Black, as Voldemort's right-hand man, would be just as frightened
of him?
And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about.
They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed
all around the school, Black's chances of getting inside seemed very
remote.
No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his
chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want
Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact,
Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the
danger had passed.
He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn't look after
himself? He'd escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn't completely
useless....
Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent
crossed his mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming...
"I'm not going to be murdered," Harry said out loud.
"That's the spirit, dear," said his mirror sleepily.
CHAPTER FIVE
THE DEMENTOR
Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup
of tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig
to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling
a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.
"The sooner we get on the train, the better," he said. "At least I can
get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he's accusing me of dripping tea
on
his photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know," Ron grimaced, "his
girlfriend. She's hidden her face under the frame because her nose has
gone all blotchy..."
"I've got something to tell you," Harry began, but they were interrupted
by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating
Percy again.
They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front
page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was
telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young
girl. All three of them were rather giggly.
"What were you saying?" Ron asked Harry as they sat down.
"Later," Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.
Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving;
they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron's
narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and
Hermes, Percy's screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A small
wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.
"It's all right, Crookshanks," Hermione cooed through the wickerwork.
"I'll let you out on the train."
"You won't," snapped Ron. "What about poor Scabbers, eh?"
He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was
curled up in his pocket.
Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck
his head inside.
"They're here, he said. "Harry, come on."
Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward
the first of two old- fashioned dark green cars, each of which was
driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.
"In you get, Harry," said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded
street.
Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione,
Ron, and, to Ron's disgust, Percy.
The journey to King's Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry's
trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost
ordinary. though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that
Uncle Vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed. They
reached King's Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers
found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute
to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head
of
an unmoving line at the traffic lights.
Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry's elbow all the way into the station.
"Right then," he said, glancing around them. "Let's do this in pairs, as
there are so many of us. I'll go through first with Harry."
Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten,
pushing Harry's trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity
125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at
Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.
In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto
platform nine and three- quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts
Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed
with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and
had apparently taken the barrier at a run.
"Ah, there's Penelope!" said Percy, smoothing his hair and going Pink
again. Ginny caught Harry's eye, and they both turned away to hide their
laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking
with his chest thrown out so that she couldn't miss his shiny badge.
stood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr.
and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from
view.
"I need to talk to you in private," Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione
as the train picked up speed.
"Go away, Ginny," said Ron.
"Oh, that's nice," said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty
compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the
train.
This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the
window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The
Hogwarts
Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an
adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.
The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes that
had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though
quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.
"Who d'you reckon he is?" Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door
shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.
"Professor R. J. Lupin," whispered Hermione at once.
"How d'you know that?"
"It's on his case," she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the
man's head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a
large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin
was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.
"Wonder what he teaches?" said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin's pallid
profile.
"That's obvious," whispered Hermione. "There's only one vacancy, isn't
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors
that the job was jinxed.
"well, I hope he's up to it," said Ron doubtfully. "He looks like on,
good hex would finish him off, doesn't he? Anyway..." He turned to
Harry. "What were you going to tell us?"
Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's argument and the
warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. he'd finished, Ron
looked
thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally
lowered them to say, "Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh,
Harry... you'll have to be really, really careful. don't go looking for
trouble, Harry --"
"I Don't go looking for trouble," said Harry, nettled. "Trouble usually
finds me."
"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants
to kill him?" said Ron shakily.
They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and
Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.
"No one knows how he got out of Azkaban," said Ron uncomfortably. "No
one's ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too."
"But they'll catch him, won't they?" said Hermione earnestly. "I Mean,
they've got all the Muggles looking out for him too...." "What's that
noise?" said Ron suddenly.
A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. The, looked
all around the compartment.
"It's coming from your trunk, Harry," said Ron, standing UP and reaching
into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the Pocket
Sneakoscope out from between Harry's robes. It was spinning very fast in
the palm of Ron's hand and glowing brilliantly.
"Is that a Sneakoscope?" said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a
better look.
"Yeah... mind you, it's a very cheap one," Ron said. "It went haywire
just as I was tying it to Errol's leg to send it to Harry."
"Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?" said Hermione
shrewdly.
"No! Well... I wasn't supposed to be using Errol. You know he's not
really up to long journeys... but how else was I supposed to get Harry's
present to him?"
"Stick it back in the trunk," Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled
piercingly, "or it'll wake him up."
He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a
particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks, which deadened
the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.
"We could get it checked in Hogsmeade," said Ron, sitting back down.
"They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments
and stuff. Fred and George told me."
"Do you know much about Hogsmeade?" asked Hermione keenly. "I've
read
it's the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain --"
"Yeah, I think it is," said Ron in an offhand sort of way.
"But that's not Why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honey
Dukes."
"What's that?" said Hermione.
"It's this sweetshop," said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face,
"where they've got everything... Pepper Imps -- they make you smoke at
the mouth -- and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and
clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in
class and just look like you're thinking what to write next --"
"But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it?" Hermione pressed
on eagerly. "In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the
headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shades
supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain --"
"-- and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off
the ground while you're sucking them," said Ron, who was plainly not
listening to a word Hermione was saying.
Hermione looked around at Harry.
"Won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?"
"'Spect it will," said Harry heavily. "You'll have to tell me when
You've found out."
"What d'you mean?" said Ron.
"I can't go. The Dursleys didn't sign my permission form, and Fudge
wouldn't either."
Ron looked horrified.
""You're not allowed to come? But -- no way -- McGonagall or someone
will give you permission -- " musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a
pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly
hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.
"Well, look who it is," said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling
open the compartment door. "Potty and the Weasel."
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.
"I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer,
Weasley," said Malfoy. "Did your mother die of shock?"
Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks's basket to the floor.
Professor Lupin gave a snort.
"Who's that?" said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he
spotted Lupin.
"New teacher," said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed
to hold Ron back. "What were you saying, Malfoy?"
Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed; he wasn't fool enough to pick a fight right
under a teacher's nose.
"C'mon," he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they
disappeared.
Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles.
"I'm not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year," he said angrily.
"I mean it. If he makes one more crack about my family, I'm going to get
hold of his head and --"
Ron made a violent gesture in midair.
"Ron," hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, "be careful..."
But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.
The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were
now a solid, shimmering gray, which graduily darkened until lanterns
flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.
The train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still,
Professor Lupin slept.
"We must be nearly there," said Ron, leaning forward to look past
Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.
The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down.
"Great," said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin
to try and see outside. "I'm starving. I want to get to the feast....
"We can't be there yet," said Hermione, checking her watch.
"So why're we stopping?"
The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons
fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the
windows.
Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All
along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their
compartments.
The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told
them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning,
all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.
"'What's going on?" said Ron's voice from behind Harry.
"Ouch!" gasped Hermione. "Ron, that was my foot!"
Harry felt his way back to his seat.
"D'you think we've broken down?"
"Dunno..."
There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of
Ron,
wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.
"There's something moving out there," Ron said. "I think people are
coming aboard...."
The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over
Harry's legs.
"Sorry -- d'you know what's going on? -- Ouch -- sorry
"Hullo, Neville," said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling
Neville up by his cloak.
"Harry? Is that you? What's happening?"
"No idea -- sit down --"
There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on
Crookshanks.
"I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on," came Hermione's
voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and
then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.
"Who's that?"
"Who's that?"
"Ginny?"
"Hermione?"
"What are you doing?"
"I was looking for Ron --" "Come in and sit down --"
"Not here!" said Harry hurriedly. "I'm here!"
"Ouch!" said Neville.
"Quiet!" said a hoarse voice suddenly.
Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear
movements in his corner.
None of them spoke.
There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the
compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames.
They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and
wary.
"Stay where you are," he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got
slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.
But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.
Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's
hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was
completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry's eyes darted downward, and
what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding
from
the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed,
like something dead that had decayed in water...
But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature
beneath the cloak sensed Harry's gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn
into the folds of its black cloak.
And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow,
rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than
air from its surroundings.
An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in
his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest,
it was inside his very heart....
Harry's eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn't see. He was drowning
in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was
being dragged downward, the roaring growing louder. .
And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified,
pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his
arms, but couldn't... a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside
him -
"Harry! Harry! Are you all right?"
Someone was slapping his face.
"W -- what?"
Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was
shaking -- the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had
come
back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron and
Hermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Neville
and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his
hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.
Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.
"Are you okay?" Ron asked nervously.
"Yeah," said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature
had vanished. "What happened? Where's that -- that thing? Who
screamed?"
"No one screamed," said Ron, more nervously still.
Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked
back at him, both very pale.
"But I heard screaming --"
A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an
enormous
slab of chocolate into pieces.
"Here," he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. "Eat
it. It'll help."
Harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it.
"What was that thing?" he asked Lupin.
"A dementor," said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone
else.
"One of the dementors of Azkaban."
Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate
wrapper and put it in his pocket.
"Eat," he repeated. "It'll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse
me...
He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.
"Are you sure you're okay, Harry?" said Hermione, watching Harry
anxiously.
"I Don't get it.... What happened?" said Harry, wiping more sweat off
his face.
"Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around (I
mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face) -- and you -- you
"I thought you were having a fit or something," said Ron, who still
looked scared. "You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and
started twitching -- 11
"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor,
and pulled out his wand," said Hermione, "and he said, 'None of us is
hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.' But the dementor didn't move,
so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at
it, and it turned around and sort of glided away.... "
"It was horrible," said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. "Did YOU
feel how cold it got when it came in?"
I felt weird," said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. "Like I'd
never be cheerful again...."
Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry
felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting arm
around her.
"But didn't any of you -- fall off your seats?" said Harry awkwardly.
"No," said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. "Ginny was shaking
like mad, though...."
Harry didn't understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were
recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame.
Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?
Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around,
and said, with a small smile, "I haven't poisoned that chocolate, you
know...."
Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly
to the tips of his fingers and toes.
"We'll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes," said Professor Lupin. "Are you
all right, Harry?"
Harry didn't ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.
"Fine," he muttered, embarrassed.
They didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last,
the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble
to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville's pet toad croaked
loudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain
was driving down in icy sheets.
"Firs' years this way!" called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end
of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward
for their traditional journey across the lake.
"All right, you three?" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They
waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of
people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and
out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches
awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by
an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door,
the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the
chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at him
sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.
As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron
gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,
Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on
either
side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned
back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the
gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the
castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many
turrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt,
and Hermione and Ron got out.
As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear.
"You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottorn telling the truth? You actualy
fainted?"
Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry's way up the stone steps to
the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously.
"Shove off, Malfoy," said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.
"Did you faint as well, Weasley?" said Malfoy loudly. "Did the scary old
dementor frighten you too, Weasley?"
"Is there a problem?" said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten
out of the next carriage.
Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches
on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm
in his voice, he said, "Oh, no -- er -- Professor," then he smirked at
Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.
Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of
them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front
doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming
torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper
floors.
The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the
crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which
was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, "Potter! Granger! I
want to see you both!"
Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall,
Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over
the heads of the crowd. She was a sternlooking witch who wore her hair
in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry
fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor
McGonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something
wrong.
"There's no need to look so worried -- I just want a word in MY office,"
she told them. "Move along there, Weasley."
Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away
from
the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up
the marble staircase, and along a corridor.
Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire,
Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. She
settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, "Professor Lupin sent
an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter."
Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam
Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in.
Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that he'd
passed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone making all this
fuss.
"I'm fine," he said, "I don't need anything
"Oh, it's you, is it?" said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending
down to stare closely at him. "I suppose you've been doing something
dangerous again?"
"It was a dementor, Poppy," said Professor McGonagall.
They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked
disapprovingly.
"Setting dementors around a school, she muttered, pushing back Harry's
hair and feeling his forehead. "He won't be the last one who collapses.
Yes, he's all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they
have on people who are already delicate
"I'm not delicate!" said Harry crossly.
"Of course you're not," said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking
his pulse.
"What does he need?" said Professor McGonagall crisply. "Bed rest?
Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?"
"I'm fine!" said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy
would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture.
"Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least," said Madam
Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry's eyes.
"I've already had some," said Harry. "Professor Lupin gave me some. He
gave it to all of us."
"Did he, now?" said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. "So we've finally got a
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?"
"Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?" Professor McGonagall said
sharply.
"Yes, "said Harry.
"Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss
Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast
together."
Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the
hospital wing, muttering to herself He had to wait only a few minutes;
then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by
Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down
the
marble staircase to the Great Hall.
It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was
lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of
candles, which were floating over the tables in midair. Professor
Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was
carrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall.
"Oh," said Hermione softly, "we've missed the Sorting!"
New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the
sorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to
(Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall
strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and
Hermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward
the Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as they passed along
the back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story
of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast?
He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them
seats.
"What was all that about?" he muttered to Harry.
Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster
stood up to speak, and he broke off.
Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of
great energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard,
half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He was often
described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn't why Harry
respected him. You couldn't help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as
Harry
watched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for the
first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment.
"Welcome!" said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard.
"Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you
all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out
of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast...."
Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, "As you will all be aware
after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently
playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on
Ministry of Magic business."
He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about
Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school.
"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds," Dumbledore
continued, "and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody
is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by
tricks or disguises -- or even Invisibility Cloaks," he added blandly,
and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. "It is not in the nature of a
dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and
every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the
prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student
runs afoul of the dementors," he said.
Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest
again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he
looked
very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.
"On a happier note," he continued, I am pleased to welcome two new
teachers to our ranks this year.
"First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who
had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped
hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next
to all the other teachers in their best robes.
"Look at Snape!" Ron hissed in Harry's ear.
Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table
at Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape ,anted the
Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was
startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. it was beyond
anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was
the look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.
"As to our second new appointment," Dumbledore continued as the
lukewarm
applause for Professor Lupin died away. "Well, I am sorry to tell you
that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher,
retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his
remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be
filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this
teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then they
joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor
table in particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who was
ruby-red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide
grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard.
"We should've known!" Ron roared, pounding the table. "Who else would
have assigned us a biting book?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as
Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was
wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.
"Well, I think that's everything of importance," said Dumbledore. "Let
the feast begin!"
The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and
drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he could
reach and began to eat.
It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the
clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were
eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew how
much being made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn't a fully
qualified wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year
for a crime he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione
who had cleared Hagrid's name last year.
At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the
golden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all
to go to bed, and they got their chance.
"Congratulations, Hagrid!" Hermione squealed as they reached the
teachers' table.
"All down ter you three," said Hagrid, wiping his shining face on his
napkin as he looked up at them., "Can' believe it... great man,
Dumbledore... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn
said he'd had enough.... It's what I always wanted. --"
Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor
McGonagall shooed them away.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble
staircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, UP more and more
stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower's large portrait of a
fat lady in a pink dress asked them, "Password?"
"Coming through, coming through!" Percy called from behind the crowd.
"The new password's 'Fortuna Major'!"
"Oh no," said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble
remembering the passwords.
Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys
divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair
with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back. They
reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster
beds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last.
CHAPTER SIX
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the
next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be
entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As
they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and
there was a roar of laughter.
"Ignore him," said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. "Just ignore
him, it's not worth it...."
"Hey, Potter!" shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face
like a pug. "Potter! The dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooooo!"
Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George
Weasley.
"New third-year course schedules," said George, passing then, over.
"What's up with you, Harry?"
"Malfoy," said Ron, sitting down on George's other side and glaring over
at the Slytherin table.
George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror
again.
"That little git," he said calmly. "He wasn't so cocky last night when
the dementors were down at our end of the train. Came runing into our
compartment, didn't he, Fred?"
"Nearly wet himself," said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.
"I wasn't too happy myself," said George. "They're horrible things,
those dementors...."
"Sort of freeze your insides, don't they?" said Fred.
"You didn't pass out, though, did you?" said Harry in a low voice.
"Forget it, Harry," said George bracingly. "Dad had to go out to Azkaban
one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he'd ever
been, he came back all weak and shaking.... They suck the happiness out
of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there."
"Anyway, we'll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch
match," said Fred. "Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the
season, remember?"
The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch
match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more
cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.
Hermione was examining her new schedule.
" Ooh, good, we're starting some new subjects today," she said happily.
villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come I. scorn
at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!"
They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out
of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and down
in rage. But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing
made him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass.
"Are you all right?" said Harry, moving closer to the picture.
"Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!"
The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up,
but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all
his might, he couldn't get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back
down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.
"Listen," said Harry, taking advantage of the knight's exhaustion,
"we're looking for the North Tower. You don't know the way, do you?"
"A quest!" The knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to
his feet and shouted, "Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find
our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!"
He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the
fat pony, gave up, and cried, "On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady!
On! On!"
And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of
sight.
They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his
armor. Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture
ahead.
"Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!" yelled the knight, and
they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in
crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.
Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling
steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur
of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom.
"Farewell!" cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some
sinister-looking monks. "Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have
need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!"
"Yeah, we'll call you," muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, "if we
ever need someone mental."
They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where
most of the class was already assembled. There were no doors off this
landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there
was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.
"'Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,"' Harry read. "How're we
supposed to get up there?"
As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a
silvery ladder descended right at Harry's feet. Everyone got quiet.
"After you," said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.
He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In
fact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between
someone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At leasttwenty small,
circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz
armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson
light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps
were draped with dark red scarves. it was stiflingly warm, and the fire
that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy,
sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves
running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking
feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards,
countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.
Ron appeared at Harry's shoulder as the class assembled around them, all
talking in whispers.
"Where is she?" Ron said.
A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.
"Welcome," it said. "How nice to see you in the physical world at last."
Harry's immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect.
Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was
very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their
natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable
chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands
were encrusted with bangles and rings.
"Sit, my children, sit," she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into
armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves
around the same round table.
"Welcome to Divination," said Professor Trelawney, who had seated
herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. "My name is professor
Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too
often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner
Eye."
Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor
Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, "So you have
chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I
must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is
very little I will be able to teach you.. Books can take you only so far
in this field...."
At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who
looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in this
subject.
"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud
bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate
the veiled mysteries of the future," Professor Trelawney went on, her
enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. "It is a Gift
granted to few. You, boy," she said suddenly to Neville, who almost
toppled off his pouf. "Is your grandmother well?"
"I think so," said Neville tremulously.
"I wouldn't be so sure if I were you, dear," said Professor Trelawney,
the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped.
Professor Trelawney continued placidly. "We will be covering the basic
methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to
reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the
way, my dear," she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, "beware a red-haired
man."
Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged
her chair away from him.
"In the second term," Professor Trelawney went on, "we shall progress to
the crystal ball -- if we have finished with fire omens, that is.
Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of
flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number
will leave us forever."
A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor
Trelawney seemed unaware of it.
"I wonder, dear," she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and
shrank
back in her chair, "if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?"
Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the
shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.
"Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading -- it
will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October."
Lavender trembled.
"Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the
shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink
until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with
the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the
last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to
read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of
Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing.
Oh, and dear" -- she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up --
"after you've broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select
one of the blue patterned ones? I'm rather attached to the pink."
Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when
there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to
him holding a dustpan and brush and said, "One of the blue ones, then,
dear, if you wouldn't mind... thank you. ... "
When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their
table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the
dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the
cups and swapped over.
"Right," said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six.
"What can you see in mine?"
"A load of soggy brown stuff," said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke
in
the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid.
"Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the
mundane!" Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom.
Harry tried to pull himself together.
"Right, you've got a crooked sort of cross... " He consulted Unfogging
the Future. "That means you're going to have 'trials and suffering' --
sorry about that -- but there's a thing that could be the sun... hang
on... that means 'great happiness'... so you're going to suffer but be
very happy...."
"You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me," said Ron, and they both
had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their
direction.
"My turn..." Ron peered into Harry's teacup, his forehead wrinkled with
effort. "There's a blob a bit like a bowler hat," he said. "Maybe you're
going to work for the Ministry of Magic...
He turned the teacup the other way up.
"But this way it looks more like an acorn.... What's that?" He scanned
his copy of Unfogging the Future. "'A windfall, unexpected gold.'
Excellent, you can lend me some... and there's a thin, here," he turned
the cup again, "that looks like an animal... yeah, if that was its
head... it looks like a hippo... no, a sheep..."
Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.
"Let me see that, my dear," she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over
and snatching Harry's cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.
Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it
counterclockwise.
"The falcon... my dear, you have a deadly enemy."
"But everyone knows that, " said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor
Trelawney stared at her.
"Well, they do," said Hermione. "Everybody knows about Harry and
You-Know-Who."
Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration.
They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before.
Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes to
Harry's cup again and continued to turn it.
"The club... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup....
I thought that was a bowler hat," said Ron sheepishly.
"The skull... danger in your path, my dear...."
Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the
cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed.
There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his
second cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her
glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed.
"My dear boy... my poor, dear boy no it is kinder not to say.. . no...
don't ask me...."
"What is it, Professor?" said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to
their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron's table,
pressing close to Professor Trelawney's chair to get a
good look at Harry's cup.
"My dear," Professor Trelawney's huge eyes opened dramatically,
"You have the Grim."
"The what?" said Harry.
He could tell that he wasn't the only one who didn't understand; Dean
Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly
everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.
"The Grim, my dear, the Grim!" cried Professor Trelawney, who looked
shocked that Harry hadn't understood. "The giant, spectral dog that
haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen -- the worst omen -- of
death!"
Harry's stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in
Flourish and Blotts -the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent...
Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was
looking
at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved
around
to the back of Professor Trelawney's chair.
"I don't think it looks like a Grim," she said flatly.
Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike.
"You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little
aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the
future." Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side.
"It looks like a Grim if you do this," he said, with his eyes almost
shut, "but it looks more like a donkey from here," he said, leaning to
the left.
"When you've all finished deciding whether I'm going to die Or not!"
said Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want
to look at him.
"I think we will leave the lesson here for today," said Professor
Trelawney in her mistiest voice. "Yes... please pack away your
things...."
Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney,
packed away their books, and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding
Harry's eyes.
"Until we meet again," said Professor Trelawney faintly, "fair fortune
be yours. Oh, and dear" -- she pointed at Neville -- "you'll be late
next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney's ladder and
the
winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall's
Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that,
early as they had left Divination, they were only just in time.
Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he
were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept
shooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead at
any moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling
them
about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and
wasn't even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes
into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes.
"Really, what has got into you all today?" said Professor McGonagall,
turning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at them
all. "Not that it matters, but that's the first time my transformation's
not got applause from a class."
Everybody's heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then
Hermione raised her hand.
"Please, Professor, we've just had our first Divination class, and we
were reading the tea leaves, and --"
"Ah, of course," said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning.
"There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you
will be dying this year?"
Everyone stared at her.
"Me," said Harry, finally.
"I see," said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes.
"Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the
death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of
them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a
new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my
colleagues --"
Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone
white. She went on, more calmly, "Divination is one of the most
imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have
very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor
Trelawney --"
She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, "You
look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don't
let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not
hand it in."
Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared
of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling
perfume of Professor Trelawney's classroom. Not everyone was
convinced,
however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, "But what
about Neville's cup?"
When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd
thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.
"Ron, cheer up," said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. "You
heard what Professor McGonagall said."
Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn't start.
"Harry," he said, in a low, serious voice, "You haven't seen a great
black dog anywhere, have you?"
"Yeah, I have," said Harry. "I saw one the night I left the Dursleys'. "
Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.
"Probably a stray," said Hermione calmly.
Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad.
"Hermione, if Harry's seen a Grim, that's -- that's bad," he said. "My
-- my uncle Bilius saw one and -- and he died twenty-four hours later!"
"Coincidence," said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.
"You don't know what you're talking about!" said Ron, starting to get
angry. "Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!"
"There you are, then," said Hermione in a superior tone. "They see the
Grim and die of fright. The Grim's not an omen, it's the cause of death!
And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one and
think, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then!"
Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her
new
Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.
"I think Divination seems very woolly," she said, searching for her
page. "A lot of guesswork, if you ask me."
"There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!" said Ron hotly.
"You didn't seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a
sheep," said Hermione coolly.
"Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura! You just don't
like being bad at something for a change!"
He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down
on the
table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.
"If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens
in a lump of tea leaves, I'm not sure I'll be studying it much longer!
That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!"
She snatched up her bag and stalked away.
Ron frowned after her.
"What's she talking about?" he said to Harry. "She hasn't been to an
Arithmancy class yet."
Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday's rain
had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springy
and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical
Creatures class.
Ron and Hermione weren't speaking to each other. Harry walked beside
them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid's hut on
the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted three
only-too- familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be
having these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly
to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he knew
what they were talking about.
Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his
moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking
impatient to start.
"C'mon, now, get a move on!" he called as the class approached. "Got a
real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin' up! Everyone here? Right,
follow me!"
For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them
into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to
last him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the
trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of
paddock. There was nothing in there.
"Everyone gather 'round the fence here!" he called. "That's it -- make
sure yeh can see -- now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer
books --"
"How?" said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.
"Eh?" said Hagrid.
"How do we open our books?" Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of
The
Monster Book of Monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of
rope.
Other people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had belted their
book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them
together with binder clips.
"Hasn' -- hasn' anyone bin able ter open their books?" said Hagrid,
looking crestfallen.
The class all shook their heads.
"Yeh've got ter stroke 'em," said Hagrid, as though this was the most
obvious thing in the world. "Look --"
He took Hermione's copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The
book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine,
and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.
"Oh, how silly we've all been!" Malfoy sneered. "We should have stroked
them! why didn't we guess!"
"I -- I thought they were funny," Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione.
"Oh, tremendously funny!" said Malfoy. "Really witty, giving us books
that try and rip our hands off!"
"Shut up, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and
Harry wanted Hagrid's first lesson to be a success.
"Righ' then," said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, "so -- so
yeh've got yer books an' -- an' - - now yeh need the Magical Creatures.
Yeah. So I'll go an' get 'em. Hang on... "
He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight.
"God, this place is going to the dogs," said Malfoy loudly. "That oaf
teaching classes, my father'll have a fit when I tell him
"Shut up, Malfoy," Harry repeated.
"Careful, Potter, there's a dementor behind you
"Oooooooh!" squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side
of the paddock.
Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry
had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but
the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with
cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly, orange eyes. The
talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking.
Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was
attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the
vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the
creatures.
"Gee up, there!" he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures
toward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as
Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence.
"Hippogriffs!" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. "Beau'iful,
aren' they?"
Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first
shock of seeing something that was, half horse, half bird, you started
to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from
feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze,
pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black.
"So," said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, "if
yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer --"
No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however,
approached
the fence cautiously.
"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,"
said Hagrid. "Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one,
'cause it might be the last thing yeh do."
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an
undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to
disrupt the lesson.
"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move," Hagrid
continued. "It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yeh
wait. If he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. If he doesn' bow,
then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt.
"Right -- who wants ter go first?"
Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and
Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads
and flexing their powerful wings; they didn't seem to like being
tethered like this.
"No one?" said Hagrid, with a pleading look.
"I'll do it," said Harry.
There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and
Parvati whispered, "Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!"
Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence.
"Good man, Harry!" roared Hagrid. "Right then -- let's see how yeh get
on with Buckbeak."
He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its
fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side
of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were
narrowed maliciously.
"Easy) now, Harry," said Hagrid quietly. "Yeh've got eye contact, now
try not ter blink.... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too
much...."
Harry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut thern.
Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with
one fierce orange eye. "Tha's it," said Hagrid. "Tha's it, Harry... now,
bow."
Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak,
but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.
The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn't move.
"Ah," said Hagrid, sounding worried. "Right -- back away, now, Harry,
easy does it
But then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its
scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.
"Well done, Harry!" said Hagrid, ecstatic. "Right -- yeh can touch him!
Pat his beak, go on!"
Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved
slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the
beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though
enjoying it.
The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,
who were looking deeply disappointed.
"Righ' then, Harry," said Hagrid. "I reckon he might' let yeh ride him!"
This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a
broomstick;
but he wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.
"Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint," said Hagrid, "an' mind
yeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that...."
Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto
its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn't sure where to hold on;
everything in front of him was covered with feathers.
"Go on, then'" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters.
Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry,
he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was
soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which
one he preferred; the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on either
side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was
about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers
and he didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of
his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and
forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its
wings.
Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the
ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the
smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak,
then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He
just managed to hold on and push himself straight again.
"Good work, Harry!" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe,
and
Goyle cheered. "Okay, who else wants a go?"
Emboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously
into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon
people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran
repeatedly backward from his, which didn't seem to want to bend its
knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to
Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.
"This is very easy," Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him.
"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.... I bet you're not
dangerous at all, are you?" he said to the hippogriff. "Are you, you
great ugly brute?"
It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched
scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his
collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,
blood blossoming over his robes.
"I'm dying!" Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. "I'm dying, look at
me! It's killed me!"
"Yer not dyin'!" said Hagrid, who had gone very white. "Someone help me
-- gotta get him outta here --"
Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As
they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy's arm;
blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward
the castle.
Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The
Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.
"They should fire him straight away!" said Pansy Parkinson, who was in
tears.
"It was Malfoy's fault!" snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed
their muscles threateningly.
They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall.
"I'm going to see if he's okay!" said Pansy, and they all watched her
run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about
Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room;
Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.
"You think he'll be all right?" said Hermione nervously.
"Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second," said
Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.
"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though,
wasn't it?" said Ron, looking worried. "Trust Malfoy to mess things up
for him...."
They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping
to see Hagrid, but he wasn't there.
"They wouldn't fire him, would they?" said Hermione anxiously, not
touching her steak-and- kidney pudding.
"They'd better not," said Ron, who wasn't eating either.
Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe
and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure
they were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.
"Well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back," said Ron
gloomily.
They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and
tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all
three of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window.
"There's a light on in Hagrid's window," Harry said suddenly.
Ron looked at his watch.
"If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It's still quite early..."
I don't know," Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him.
"I'm allowed to walk across the grounds, " he said Pointedly. "Sirius
Black hasn't got past the dementors yet, has he?"
So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad
to meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren't entirely
sure they were supposed to be out.
The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. When
they reached Hagrid's hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, "C'min."
Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his
boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid's lap. One look told them that
Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big
as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty
getting them into focus.
"'Spect it's a record," he said thickly, when he recognized them. "Don'
reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before."
"You haven't been fired, Hagrid!" gasped Hermione.
"Not yet," said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in
the tankard. "But's only a matter o' time, i' n't it, after Malfoy..."
"How is he?" said Ron as they all sat down. "It wasn't serious, was it?"
"Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could," said Hagrid dully, "but he's
sayin' it's still agony... covered in bandages... moanin'..
"He's faking it, " said Harry at once. "Madam Pomfrey can mend anything.
She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it's
worth."
"School gov'nors have bin told, o' course," said Hagrid miseribly. "They
reckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later... done
flobberworms or summat.... Jus' thought itdmake a good firs' lessons all
my fault...."
"It's all Malfoy's fault, Hagrid!" said Hermione earnestly.
"We're witnesses," said Harry. "You said hippogriffs attack if you
insult them. It's Malfoy's problem that he wasn't listening. We'll tell
Dumbledore what really happened."
"Yeah, don't worry, Hagrid, we'll back you up," said Ron.
Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes.
He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking
hug.
"I think you've had enough to drink, Hagrid," said Hermione firmly. She
took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.
"At, maybe she's right," said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who
both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of
his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud
splash.
"What's he done?" said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with
the
empty tankard.
"Stuck his head in the water barrel," said Hermione, putting the tankard
away.
Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water
out of his eyes.
"That's better," he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them
all. "Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an' see me, I really --
Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he'd only just realized
he was there.
"WHAT D'YEH THINK YOU'RE DOIN', EH?" he roared, so suddenly
that they
jumped a foot in the air. "YEH'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN' AROUND
AFTER DARK,
HARRY! AN, YOU TWO! LETTIN' HIM!"
Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the
door.
"C'mon!" Hagrid said angrily. "I'm takin' yer all back up ter school,
an' don' let me catch yeh walkin' down ter see me after dark again. I'm
not worth that!"
CHAPTER SEVEN
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE
Malfoy didn't reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when
the Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He
swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound
up in a sling, acting, in Harry's opinion, as though he were the heroic
survivor of some dreadful battle.
"How is it, Draco?" simpered Pansy Parkinson. "Does it hurt much?"
"Yeah," said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw
him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.
"Settle down, settle down," said Professor Snape idly.
Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn't have said "settle
down" if they'd walked in late, he'd have given them detention. But
Malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape's
classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generality favored his
own students above all others.
They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set
up
his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing
their ingredients on the same table.
"Sir," Malfoy called, "sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots,
because of my arm --"
"Weasley, cut up Malfoy's roots for him," said Snape without looking up.
Ron went brick red.
"There's nothing wrong with your arm," he hissed at Malfoy.
Malfoy smirked across the table.
"Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots."
Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy's roots toward him, and began to
chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.
"Professor," drawled Malfoy, "Weasley's mutilating my roots, sit."
Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots,
then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black
hair.
"Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley."
"But, sit --!"
Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own
roots into exactly equal pieces.
"Now," said Snape in his most dangerous voice.
Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a, Malfoy,
then took up the knife again.
"And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned," said Malfoy, his voice
full of malicious laughter.
"Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig," said Snape, giving Harry the
look of loathing he always reserved just for him.
Harry took Malfoy's shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage
to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as
he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking.
Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.
"Seen your pal Hagrid lately?" he asked them quietly.
"None of your business," said Ron jerkily, without looking up.
"I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer," said Malfoy in a tone of
mock sorrow. "Father's not very happy about my injury --"
"Keep talking, Malfoy, and I'll give you a real injury," snarled Ron.
"- he's complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of
Magic. Father's got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury
like this" -- he gave a huge, fake sigh -- "who knows if my arm'll ever
be the same again?"
"So that's why you're putting it on," said Harry, accidentally beheading
a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger. "To try to get
Hagrid fired."
"Well," said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, "partly, Potter.
But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for
me."
A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to
pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst subject, and his great fear
of Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His potion, which was
supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned --
"Orange, Longbottom," said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to
splash
back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.
"Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of
yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one -tat spleen
was needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would
suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?"
Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge
of tears.
"Please, sir," said Hermione, "please, I could help Neville put it right
--"
"I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger," said Snape
coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. "Longbottom, at the end of
this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see
what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly."
Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear.
"Help me!" he moaned to Hermione.
"Hey, Harry," said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry's brass
scales, "have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning -- they reckon
Sirius Black's been sighted."
"Where?" said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table,
Malfoy looked up, listening closely.
"Not too far from here," said Seamus, who looked excited. "It was a
Muggle who saw him. 'Course, she didn't really understand. The Muggles
think he's just an ordinary criminal, don't they? So she phoned the
telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was
gone."
"Not too far from here... " Ron repeated, looking significantly at
Harry. He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. "What,
Malfoy?
Need something else skinned?"
But Malfoy's eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed Harry.
He leaned across the table.
Black single-handed, Potter?"
"Thinking Of trying to catch
"Yeah, that's right," said Harry offhandedly.
Malfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.
"Of course, if it was me," he said quietly, "I'd have done something
before now. I wouldn't be staying in school like a good boy, I'd be out
there looking for him."
"What are you talking about, Malfoy?" said Ron roughly.
"Don't you know, Potter?" breathed Malfoy, his pate eyes narrowed.
"Know what?"
Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.
"Maybe you'd rather not risk your neck," he said. "Want to leave it to
the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I'd want revenge. I'd hunt him
down myself."
"What are you talking about?" said Harry angrily, but at that moment
Snape called, "You should have finished adding your ingredients by now;
this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while it
simmers and then we'll test Longbottom's... "
Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred
his potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of
the corner of her mouth, so that Snape wouldn't see. Harry and Ron
packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and
ladles in the stone basin in the corner.
"What did Malfoy mean?" Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands
under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle's mouth "Why would I
want revenge on Black? He hasn't done anything to me -- yet.
"He's making it up," said Ron savagely. "He's trying to make you do
something stupid...."
The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was
cowering by his cauldron.
"Everyone gather 'round," said Snape, his black eyes glittering, and
watch what happens to Longbottom's toad. If he has managed to produce a
Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don't doubt,
he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned."
The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape
picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into
Neville's potion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops down
Trevor's throat.
There was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there
was a small pop, and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape's palm.
The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small
bottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor,
and he reappeared suddenly, fully grown.
"Five points from Gryffindor," said Snape, which wiped the smiles from
every face. "I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry
was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething
about Snape.
"Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right!
Why didn't You lie, Hermione? You should've said Neville did it all by
himself!"
Hermione didn't answer. Ron looked around.
"Where is she?"
Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the
rest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch.
"She was right behind us," said Ron, frowning.
Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at
Harry and disappeared.
"There she is," said Harry.
Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched
her bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her
robes.
"How did you do that?" said Ron.
"What?" said Hermione, joining them.
"One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at
the bottom of the stairs again."
"What?" Hermione looked slightly confused. "Oh -- I had to go back for
something. Oh no --"
A seam had split on Hermione's bag. Harry wasn't surprised; he could see
that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.
"Why are you carrying all these around with you?" Ron asked her.
"You know how many subjects I'm taking," said Hermione breathlessly.
"Couldn't hold these for me, could you?"
"But --" Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at
the covers. "You havent got any of these subjects today. It's only
Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon."
"Oh yes," said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into
her bag just the same. I hope there's something good for lunch, I'm
starving," she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.
"D'you get the feeling Hermione's not telling us something?Ron asked
Harry.
Professor Lupin wasn't there when they arrived at his first Defense
Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books,
quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered the
room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the
teacher's desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he
had on the train, as though he had had a few square meals.
"Good afternoon," he said. "Would you please put all your books back in
your bags. Today's will be a practical lesson. You will need only your
wands."
A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books.
They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts before,
unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher
had brought a cageful of pixies -to class and set them loose.
"Right then," said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. "If you'd
follow me."
Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor
Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted corridor and
around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the
Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the
nearest keyhole with chewing gum.
Peeves didn't look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; ,hen he
wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song.
"Loony, loopy Lupin," Peeves sang. "Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy
Lupin --"
Rude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually showed
some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor
Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he was still
smiling.
"I'd take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves," he said
pleasantly. "Mr. Filch won't be able to get in to his brooms."
Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who
waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However,
Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin's words, except to blow a
loud wet raspberry.
Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand.
"This is a useful little spell, he told the class over his shoulder.
"Please watch closely."
He raised the wand to shoulder height, said, "Waddiwasi! "and pointed it
at Peeves.
With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the
keyhole and straight down Peeves's left nostril; he whirled upright and
zoomed away, cursing.
"Cool, sit!" said Dean Thomas in amazement.
"Thank you, Dean," said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again.
"Shall we proceed?"
They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with
increased respect. He led them down a second corridor and stopped, right
outside the staffroom door.
"Inside, please," said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.
The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was
empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a low
armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were
glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. As
Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind him, Snape
said, "Leave it open, Lupin. I'd rather not witness this."
He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing
behind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said, "Possibly no
one's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I
would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless
Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear."
Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he
bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of other
teachers.
Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.
"I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the
operation," he said, "and I am sure he will perform it admirably."
Neville's face went, if possible, even redder. Snape's lip curled, but
he left, shutting the door with a snap.
"Now, then," said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of
the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers
kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the
wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.
"Nothing to worry about," said Professor Lupin calmly because a few
people had jumped backward in alarm. "There's a boggart in there."
Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about.
Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan
eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.
"Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces," said Professor Lupin. "Wardrobes,
the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I've even met one
that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in
yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave
it to give my third years some practice.
"So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?"
Hermione put up her hand.
"It's a shape-shifter," she said. "It can take the shape of whatever it
thinks will frighten us most."
"Couldn't have put it better myself," said Professor Lupin, and Hermione
glowed. "So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet
assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on
the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when
he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever
each of us most fears.
"This means," said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's 'mall
sputter of terror, "that we have a huge advantage over the boggart
before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?"
Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and
down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very
off-putting, but Harry had a go.
"Er -- because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it
should be?"
"Precisely," said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down,
looking a little disappointed. "It's always best to have com pany when
you're dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he
become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart
make that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and
turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.
"The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of
mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter.
What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.
"We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please ...
Riddikulus!"
"Riddikulus!" said the class together.
"Good," said Professor Lupin. "Very good. But that was the easy part,
I'm afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you
come in, Neville."
The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked
forward as though he were heading for the gallows.
"Right, Neville," said Professor Lupin. "First things first: what would
you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?"
Neville's lips moved, but no noise came out.
"didn't catch that, Neville, sorry," said Professor Lupin cheerfully.
Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help
him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, "Professor Snape."
Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor
Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.
"Professor Snape... hmmm... Neville, I believe you live with your
grandmother?"
"Er -- yes," said Neville nervously. "But -- I don't want the boggart to
turn into her either."
"No, no, you misunderstand me," said Professor Lupin, now smiling. "I
wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually
wears?"
Neville looked startled, but said, "Well... always the same hat. A tall
one with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress... green,
normally... and sometimes a fox-fur scarf."
"And a handbag?" prompted Professor Lupin.
"A big red one," said Neville.
"Right then," said Professor Lupin. "Can you picture those clothes very
clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind's eye?"
"Yes," said Neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next.
"When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees You, it
will assume the form of Professor Snape," said Lupin. "And You will
raise your wand -- thus -- and cry 'Riddikulus' -- and concentrate hard
on your grandmother's clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape
will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with
that big red handbag."
There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more
violently.
"If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention
to each of us in turn," said Professor Lupin. "I would like all of you
to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and
imagine how you might force it to look comical...."
The room went quiet. Harry thought... 'What scared him most in the
world?
His first thought was Lord Voldemort -- a Voldemort returned to full
strength. But before he had even started to plan a possible
counterattack on a boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to
the surface of his mind....
A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak ... a
long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth... then a cold so penetrating
it felt like drowning....
Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many
people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to himself, "Take
its legs off " Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron's
greatest fear was spiders.
"Everyone ready?" said Professor Lupin.
Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn't ready. How could you make a
dementor less frightening? But he didn't want to ask for more time;
everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.
"Neville, we're going to back away," said Professor Lupin. "Let you have
a clear field, all right? I'll call the next person forward.... Everyone
back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot --"
They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone
beside the wardrobe. He looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed up
the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready.
"On the count of three, Neville," said Professor Lupin, who was
pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe. "One two -- three
-- now!"
A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin's wand and hit the
doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor
Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.
Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was
bearing
down upon him, reaching inside his robes.
"R -- r -- riddikulus! "squeaked Neville.
There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a
long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten
vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.
There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and
Professor Lupin shouted, "Parvati! Forward!"
Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was
another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged
mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk
toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising --
"Riddikulus!" cried Parvati.
A bandage unraveled at the mummy's feet; it became entangled, fell face
forward, and its head rolled off.
"Seamus!" roared Professor Lupin.
Seamus darted past Parvati.
Crack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black
hair
and a skeletal, green-tinged face -- a banshee. She opened her mouth
wide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek that
made the hair on Harry's head stand on end -- 'Riddikulus!" shouted
Seamus.
The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was
gone.
Crack! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle,
then -- crack!- became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before
-- crack! -- becoming a single, bloody eyeball.
'It's confused!" shouted Lupin. "We're getting there! Dean!"
Dean hurried forward.
Crack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began
to creep along the floor like a crab.
"Riddikulus!" yelled Dean.
'There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.
"Excellent! Ron, you next!"
Ron leapt forward.
Crack!
Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered
in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a
moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then --
"Riddikulus!" bellowed Ron, and the spider's legs vanished; it rolled
over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it
came to a halt at Harry's feet. He raised his wand, ready, but --
"Here!" shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack!
The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly
around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in
the air in front of Lupin, who said, "Riddikulus!" almosi lazily.
Crack!
"Forward, Neville, and finish him off!" said Lupin as the boggart landed
on the floor as a cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Neville
charged forward looking determined.
"Riddikulus!" he shouted, and they had a split second's view of Snape in
his lacy dress before Neville let out a great "Ha!" of laughter, and the
boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was
gone.
"Excellent!" cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause.
"Excellent) Neville. Well done, everyone.... Let me See... five points
to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart -- ten for Neville
because he did it twice... and five each to Hermione and Harry."
"But I didn't do anything," said Harry.
"You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the
class, Harry," Lupin said lightly. "Very well, everyone, an excellent
lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it
for me... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all."
Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn't
feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from
tackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he'd seen Harry collapse on
the train, and thought he wasn't up to much? Had he thought Harry would
pass out again?
But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.
"Did you see me take that banshee?" shouted Seamus. "And the hand!"
said
Dean, waving his own around.
"And Snape in that hat!" "And my mummy!"
I wonder why Professor Lupin's frightened of crystal balls?" said
Lavender thoughtfully.
"That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we've ever had,
wasn't it?" said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the
classroom to get their bags.
"He seems like a very good teacher," said Hermione approvingly. "But I
wish I could have had a turn with the boggart --"
"What would it have been for you?" said Ron, sniggering. "A piece of
homework that only got nine out of ten?"
CHAPTER EIGHT
FLIGHT OF THE FAT FADY
In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most
people's favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins
had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.
"Look at the state of his robes," Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as
Professor Lupin passed. "He dresses like our old houseelf "
But no one else cared that Professor Lupin's robes were patched and
frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first.
After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin like
creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons
of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to
bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to
kappas, creepy. water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with
webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.
Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst
of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these
days, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart assuming
Snape's shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his
grandmother's clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire.
Snape didn't seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at the
very mention of Professor Lupin's name, and he was bullying Neville
worse than ever.
Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor
Trelawney's stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and
symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney's enormous eyes
filled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn't like
Professer Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bordering
on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had
taken to haunting Professor Trelawney's tower room at lunch times, and
always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though
they knew things the others didn't. They had also started using hushed
voices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he were on his deathbed.
Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the
action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to
have lost his confidence. They were now spending lesson after lesson
learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the
most boring creatures in existence.
"Why would anyone bother looking after them?" said Ron, after yet
another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms' throats.
At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy
him, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory
classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and O1iver Wood,
Captain
of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting on Thursday evening to discuss
tactics for the new season.
There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it
was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball)
through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each
end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to
repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to
attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal
posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching
the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture
ended the game and earned the Seeker's team an extra one hundred and
fifty points.
Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh and final
year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice a's
he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on
the edge of the darkening Quidditch field.
"This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup,"
he told them, striding up and down in front of them. "I'll be leaving at
the end of this year. I'll never get another shot at it."
"Gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now. Okay, so we've had the worst
luck in the world -- injuries -- then the tournamentgetting called off
last year Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump to
his throat. "But we also know we've got the
best-ruddy-team-in-the-school," he said, punching a fist into his other
hand, the old manic glint back in his eye. "We've got three superb
Chasers."
Wood pointed at Alicia Spinner, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell.
"We've got two unbeatable Beaters."
"Stop it, Oliver, you're embarrassing us," said Fred and George Weasley
together, pretending to blush.
"And we've got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!" Wood
rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. "And me," he
added as an afterthought.
"We think you're very good too, Oliver," said George.
"Spanking good Keeper," said Fred.
"The point is," Wood went on, resuming his pacing, "the Quidditch Cup
should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry
joined the team, I've thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven't
got it, and this year's the last chance we'll get to finally see our
name on the thing...."
Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked sympathetic.
"Oliver, this year's our year," said Fred.
"We'll do it, Oliver!" said Angelina.
"Definitely," said Harry.
Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three
evenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights
darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry's
wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.
Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training,
cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find the
room buzzing excitedly.
"What's happened?", he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two
of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for
Astronomy.
"First Hogsmeade weekend," said Ron, pointing at a notice that had
appeared on the battered old bulletin board. "End of October.
Halloween."
"Excellent," said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait
hole. "I need to visit Zonko's. I'm nearly out of Stink Pellets."
Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing
away. Hermione seemed to read his mind.
"Harry, I'm sure you'll be able to go next time," she said. "They're
bound to catch Black soon. He's been sighted once already."
"Black's not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade," said Ron. "Ask
McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for
ages --"
"Ron!" said Hermione. "Harry's supposed to stay in school-"
"He can't be the only third year left behind," said Ron. "Ask
McGonagall, go on, Harry --"
"Yeah, I think I will," said Harry, making up his mind.
Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks
leapt
lightly onto her lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.
"Does he have to eat that in front of us?" said Ron, scowling.
"Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?" said Hermione.
Crookshanks; slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixed
insolently on Ron.
"Just keep him over there, that's all," said Ron irritably, turning back
to his star chart. "1've got Scabbers asleep in my bag."
Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own
star chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took out
parchment, ink, and quill, and started work.
"You can copy mine, if you like," said Ron, labeling his last star with
a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry.
Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn't say
anything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking
the end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced.
"OY!" Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws
deep inside it and began tearing ferociously. "GET OFF, YOU STUPID
ANIMAL!"
Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung
on, spitting and slashing.
"Ron, don't hurt him!" squealed Hermione; the whole common room was
watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it,
and Scabbers came flying out of the top -
"CATCH THAT CAR' Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the
remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the
terrified Scabbers.
George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers
streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of
drawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs,
and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw.
Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around
the
middle and heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and,
with
great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.
"Look at him!" he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front
of her. "He's skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!"
"Crookshanks doesn't understand it's wrong!" said Hermione, her voice
shaking. "All cats chase rats, Ron!"
"There's something funny about that animal!" said Ron, who was trying to
persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. "It heard
me say that Scabbers was in my bag!"
"Oh, what rubbish," said Hermione impatiently. "Crookshanks could smell
him, Ron, how else d'you think --"
"That cat's got it in for Scabbers!" said Ron, 'ignoring the people
around him, who were starting to giggle. "And Scabbers was here first,
and he's ill!"
Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to
the boys' dormitories.
Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to
her all through Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione were
working together on the same puffapod.
"How's Scabbers?" Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods
from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.
"He's hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking, " said Ron angrily,
missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor.
"Careful, Weasley, careful!" cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst
into bloom before their very eyes.
They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor
McGonagall after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the
rest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was
going to argue his case. He was distracted, however, by a disturbance at
the front of the line.
Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm around her and
was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who
were
looking very serious.
"What's the matter, Lavender?" said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry,
and Ron went to join the group.
"She got a letter from home this morning," Parvati whispered. "It's her
rabbit, Binky. He's been killed by a fox."
"Oh," said Hermione, "I'm sorry, Lavender."
"I should have known!" said Lavender tragically. "You know what day it
is?"
"Er --"
"The sixteenth of October! 'That thing you're dreading, it will happen
on the sixteenth of October!' Remember? She was right, she was right!"
The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his
head
seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said, "You -- you were dreading
Binky being killed by a fox?"
"Well, not necessarily by a fox," said Lavender, looking up at Hermione
with streaming eyes, "but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn't l?"
"Oh," said Hermione. She paused again. Then
"Was Binky an old rabbit?"
"N -- no!" sobbed Lavender. "H -- he was only a baby!"
Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender's shoulders.
"But then, why would you dread him dying?" said Hermione.
Parvati glared at her.
"Well, look at it logically," said Hermione, turning to the rest of the
group- "I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he? Lavender just got
the news today-" Lavender wailed loudly. "- and she can't have been
dreading it, because it's come as a real shock --"
"Don't mind Hermione, Lavender," said Ron loudly, "she doesn't think
other people's pets matter very much."
Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which
was
perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and
when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry
and didn't talk to each other for the whole class.
Harry still hadn't decided what he was going to say to Professor
McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she
who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.
"One moment, please !" she called as the class made to leave. "As you're
all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me
before
Halloween. No form, no visiting the village, so don't forget!"
Neville put up his hand.
"Please, Professor, I -- I think I've lost
"Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom," said Professor
McGonagall. "She seemed to think it was safer. Well, that's all, you may
leave."
"Ask her now," Ron hissed at Harry.
"Oh. but --" Hermione began.
"Go for it, Harry," said Ron stubbornly.
Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed
nervously for Professor McGonagall's desk.
"Yes, Potter?" Harry took a deep breath.
"Professor, my aunt and uncle -- er -- forgot to sign my form," he said.
Professor McGonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didn't
say anything.
"So -- er d'you think it would be all right mean, will It be okay if I
-- if I go to Hogsmeade?"
Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her
desk.
"I'm afraid not, Potter," she said. "You heard what I said. No form, no
visiting the village. That's the rule."
"But -- Professor, my aunt and uncle -- you know, they're Muggles, they
don't really understand about -- about Hogwarts forms and stuff," Harry
said, while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods. "If you said I could go
--"
"But I don't say so," said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling
her papers neatly into a drawer. "The form clearly states that the
parent or guardian must give permission." She turned to look at him,
with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? "I'm sorry, Potter, but
that's my final word. You had better hurry, or you'll be late for your
next lesson."
There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of
names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an
"all-for-the-best" expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry had
to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what
they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade.
"There's always the feast," said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry UP.
"You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening."
"Yeah," said Harry gloomily, "great."
The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if
he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing
anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind. Dean
Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon's
signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor
McGonagall he hadn't had it signed, that was no good. Ron halfheartedly
suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one,
reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the dementors
being
able to see through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful
words of comfort.
"They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it's not all
it's cracked up to be," he said seriously. "All right, the sweetshop's
rather good, and Zonko's Joke Shop's frankly dangerous, and yes, the
Shrieking Shack's always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from
that, you're not missing anything."
On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to
breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to act
normally.
"We'll bring you. lots of sweets back from Honeydukes," said Hermione,
looking desperately sorry for him.
"Yeah, loads," said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their
squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry's difficulties.
"Don't worry about me," said Harry, in what he hoped was at, offhand
voice, "I'll see you at the feast. Have a good time."
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker,
was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long
list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one
was sneaking out who shouldn't be going.
"Staying here, Potter?" shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. "Scared of passing the dementors?"
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
"Password?" said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.
"Fortuna Major," said Harry listlessly.
The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common
room. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few older
students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had
worn off
"Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!"
It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and
never missed an opportunity to speak to him.
"Aren't you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey" -- Colin looked
eagerly around at his friends -- "you can come and sit with us, if you
like, Harry!"
"Er -- no, thanks, Colin," said Harry, who wasn't in the mood to have a
lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead. "I -- I've got
to go to the library, got to get some work done."
After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out
of the portrait hole again.
"What was the point waking me up?" the Fat Lady called grumpily after
him as he walked away.
Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he
changed his mind; he didn't feel like working. He turned around and came
face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the
Hogsmeade visitors.
"What are you doing?" Filch snarled suspiciously.
"Nothing," said Harry truthfully.
"Nothing!" spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. "A likely
story! Sneaking around on your own -- why aren't you in Hogsmeade
buying
Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your
nasty little friends?"
Harry shrugged.
"Well, get back to your common room where you belong!" snapped Filch,
and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight.
But Harry didn't go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase,
thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking
along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said,
"Harry?"
Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin,
looking around his office door.
"What are you doing?" said Lupin, though in a very different voice from
Filch. "Where are Ron and Hermione?"
"Hogsmeade," said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.
"Ah," said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. "Why don't you
come
in? I've just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson." "A
what?" said Harry. I
He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank
of water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face
pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly
fingers.
"Water demon," said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. "We
shouldn't have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick
is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong,
but very brittle."
The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle
of weeds in a corner.
"Cup of tea?" Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. "I was just
thinking of making one."
"All right," said Harry awkwardly.
Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued
suddenly from the spout.
"Sit down," said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. "I've only got
teabags, I'm afraid -- but I daresay you've had enough of tea leaves?"
Harry looked at him. Lupin's eyes were twinkling.
"How did you know about that?" Harry asked.
"Professor McGonagall told me," said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped
mug
of tea. "You're not worried, are you?"
"No," said Harry.
He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he'd seen in
Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn't want Lupin to think he
was a coward, especially since Lupin alreadv seemed to think he couldn't
cope with a boggart.
Something of Harry's thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because
Lupin said, "Anything worrying you, Harry?"
"No," Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow
brandishing a fist at him. "Yes," he said suddenly, putting his tea down
on Lupin's desk. "You know that day we fought the boggart?"
"Yes," said Lupin slowly.
"Why didn't you let me fight it?" said Harry abruptly.
Lupin raised his eyebrows.
"I would have thought that was obvious, Harry," he said, sounding
surprised.
Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he'd done any such thing, was
taken aback.
"Why?" he said again.
"Well," said Lupin, frowning slightly, "I assumed that if the boggart
faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort."
Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he'd expected, but Lupin
had said Voldemort's name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the
name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.
"Clearly, I was wrong," said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. "But I
didn't think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the
staffroom. I imagined that people would panic."
"I didn't think of Voldemort," said Harry honestly. "I -- I remembered
those dementors."
"I see," said Lupin thoughtfully. "Well, well... I'm impressed." fie
smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry's face. "That suggests
that what you fear most of all is -- fear. Very wise, Harry."
Harry didn't know what to say to that, so he drank some mot,, tea.
"So you've been thinking that I didn't believe you capable of fighting
the boggart?" said Lupin shrewdly.
"Well... yeah," said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier.
"Professor Lupin, you know the dementors --"
He was interrupted by a knock on the door.
"Come in," called Lupin.
The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which
was
smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes
narrowing.
"Ah, Severus," said Lupin, smiling. "Thanks very much. Could you leave
it here on the desk for me?"
Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry
and
Lupin.
"I was just showing Harry my grindylow," said Lupin pleasantly, pointing
at the tank.
"Fascinating," said Snape, without looking at it. "You should drink that
directly, Lupin."
"Yes, Yes, I will," said Lupin.
"I made an entire cauldronful," Snape continued. "If you need more.
"I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much,
Severus."
"Not at all," said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn't
like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful.
Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.
"Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me," he said. "I
have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly
complex." He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. "Pity sugar makes it
useless," he added, taking a sip and shuddering.
"Why --?" Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished
question.
"I've been feeling a bit off-color," he said. "This potion is the only
thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor
Snape; there aren't many wizards who are up to making it."
Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the
goblet out of his hands.
"Professor Snape's very interested in the Dark Arts, he blurted out.
"Really?" said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another
gulp of potion.
"Some people reckon --" Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on,
"some people reckon he'd do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark
Arts job."
Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.
"Disgusting," he said. "Well, Harry, I'd better get back to work. see
you at the feast later."
"Right," said Harry, putting down his empty teacup.
The empty goblet was still smoking.
"There you go," said Ron. "We got as much as we could carry."
A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry's lap. It was
dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room,
pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the time
of their lives.
"Thanks," said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps.
"What's Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?"
By the sound of it -- everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding
equipment shop, Zonko's Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for
foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides.
"The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves,
all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get
there!"
"Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free
samples, there's a bit, look --"
"We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three
Broomsticks --"
"Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up --
"
"What did you do?" said Hermione, looking anxious. "Did you get any
work
done?"
"No," said Harry. "Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then
Snape came in...."
He told them all about the goblet. Ron's mouth fell open.
"Lupin drank it?" he gasped. "Is he mad?"
Hermione checked her watch.
"We'd better go down, you know, the feast'll be starting in fiveminutes
They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still
discussing Snape.
"But if he -- you know" -- Hermione dropped her voice, glancing
nervously around -- "if he was trying to to poison Lupin -- he wouldn't
have done it in front of Harry."
"Yeah, maybe," said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed
into the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of
candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and many
flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy
ceiling like brilliant watersnakes.
The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to
bursting
with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry
kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin
looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to
tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes
along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or
were Snape's eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts
ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation
gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success
with a reenactment of his own botched beheading.
It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry's good mood couldn't even
be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the
hall, "The dementors send their love, Potter!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the
usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that
ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with
students.
"Why isn't anyone going in?" said Ron curiously.
Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be
closed.
"Let me through, please," came Percy's voice, and he came bustling
importantly through the crowd. "What's the holdup here? You can't all
have forgotten the password -- excuse me, I'm Head Boy --"
And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a
chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a
suddenly sharp voice, "Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick."
People's heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe.
"What's going on?" said Ginny, who had just arrived.
A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the
portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and
Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.
"Oh, my --" Hermione grabbed Harry's arm.
The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so
viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it
had been torn away completely.
Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his
eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying
toward him.
"We need to find her," said Dumbledore. "Professor McGonagall, please
go
to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle
for the Fat Lady."
"You'll be lucky!" said a cackling voice.
It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking
delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry.
"What do you mean, Peeves?" said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves's grin
faded a little. He didn't dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an
oily voice that was no better than his cackle. "Ashamed, Your Headship,
sit. Doesn't want to be seen. She's a horrible mess. Saw her running
through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the
trees. Crying something dreadful," he said happily. "Poor thing," he
added unconvincingly.
"Did she say who did it?" said Dumbledore quietly.
"Oh yes, Professorhead," said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a
large bombshell in his arms. "He got very angry when she wouldn't let
him in, you see." Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from
between his own legs. "Nasty temper he's got, that Sirius Black."
CHAPTER NINE
GRIM DEFEAT
Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall,
where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from
Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused.
"The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,"
Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick
closed all doors into the hall. "I'm afraid that, for your own safety,
you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand
guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and
Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,"
he added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important.
"Send
word with one of the ghosts."
Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, "Oh,
yes, you'll be needing..."
One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the
hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor
was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.
"Sleep well," said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him.
The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were
telling the rest of the school what had just happened.
"Everyone into their sleeping bags!" shouted Percy. "Come on, now, no
more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!"
"C'mon," Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags
and dragged them into a corner.
"Do you think Black's still in the castle?" Hermione whispered
anxiously.
"Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be," said Ron.
"It's very lucky he picked tonight, you know," said Hermione as they
climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on
their elbows to talk. "The one night we weren't in the tower...."
I reckon he's lost track of time, being on the run," said Ron. "Didn't
realize it was Halloween. Otherwise he'd have come bursting in here."
Hermione shuddered.
All around them, people were asking one another the same question:
"How
did he get in?"
"Maybe he knows how to Apparate," said a Ravenclaw a few feet away,
"Just appear out of thin air, you know."
"Disguised himself, probably," said a Hufflepuff fifth year. "He
could've flown in," suggested Dean Thomas.
"Honestly, am I the only person who's ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A
History?" said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron.
"Probably," said Ron. "Why?"
"Because the castle's protected by more than walls, You know,,, said
Hermione. "There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people
entering by stealth. You can't just Apparate in here. And I'd like to
see the disguise that could fool those dementors. They're guarding every
single entrance to the grounds. They'd have seen him fly in too. And
Fitch knows all the secret passages, they'll have them covered...."
"The lights are going out now!" Percy shouted. "I want everyone in their
sleeping bags and no more talking!"
The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the
silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the
prefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was
scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still
filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a
light wind.
Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that
everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many students
had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched
him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the
sleeping
bags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away
from Harry, Ron, and Hermlone, who quickly pretended to be asleep as
Dumbledore's footsteps drew nearer.
"Any sign of him, Professor?" asked Percy in a whisper.
"No. All well here?"
"Everything under control, sir."
"Good. There's no point moving them all now. I've found a temporary
guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You'll be able to move them
back in tomorrow."
"And the Fat Lady, sir?"
"Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she
refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She's
still very distressed, but once she's calmed down, I'll have Mr. Filch
restore her."
Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps.
"Headmaster?" It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. "The
whole of the third floor has been searched. He's not there. And Filch
has done the dungeons; nothing there either."
"What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney's room? The
Owlery?"
"All searched."
"Very well, Severus. I didn't really expect Black to linger."
"Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?" asked Snape.
Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear,
"Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next."
Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood;
Dumbledore's back was to him, but he could see Percy's face, rapt with
attention, and Snape's profile, which looked angry.
"You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before -- ah --
the start of term?" said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as
though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.
"I do, Severus," said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning
in his voice.
"It seems -- almost impossible -- that Black could have entered the
school without inside help. I did express my concerns whet, you
appointed --"
"I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped
Black enter it," said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the
subject was closed that Snape didn't reply. "I must go down to the
dementors," said Dumbledore. I said I would inform them when our search
was complete."
"Didn't they want to help, sit?" said Percy.
"Oh yes," said Dumbledore coldly. "But I'm afraid no dementor will cross
the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster."
Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly
and quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an
expression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left.
Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their
eyes
open too, reflecting the starry ceiling.
was all that about?" Ron mouthed.
The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The
theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder;
Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology
class
telling anyone who'd listen that Black could turn into a flowering
shrub.
The Fat Lady's ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and
Replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody
was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging
people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated
passwords, which he changed at least twice a day.
"He's a complete lunatic," said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. "Can't
we get anyone else?"
"None of the other pictures wanted the job," said Percy. "Frightened of
what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave
enough
to volunteer."
Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry's worries. He was now being
closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with
him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother's orders)
was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap
it all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with such a
somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died.
"There's no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter," she said in a
very serious voice. "I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius
Black --"
"I know he's after me," said Harry wearily. "I heard Ron's dad telling
his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic."
Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a
moment or two, then said, "I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you'll
understand why I don't think it's a good idea for you to be practicing
Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only Your team members,
it's very exposed, Potter --"
"We've got our first match on Saturday!" said Harry, outraged. "I've got
to train, Professor!"
Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was
deeply
interested in the Gryffindor team's prospects; it had been she, after
all, who'd suggested him as Seeker in the first Place. He waited,
holding his breath.
"Hmm..." Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at
the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. "Well... goodness
knows, I'd like to see us win the Cup at last... but all the same,
Potter... I'd be happier if a teacher were present. I'll ask Madam Hooch
to oversee your training sessions."
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.
Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the
eye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session before
Saturday's match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.
"We're not playing Slytherin!" he told them, looking very angry.
"Flint's just been to see me. We're playing Hufflepuff instead."
"Why?" chorused the rest of the team.
"Flint's excuse is that their Seeker's arm's still injured," said Wood,
grinding his teeth furiously. "But it's obvious why they're doing it.
Don't want to play in this weather. Think it'll damage their
chances...."
There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke,
they heard a distant rumble of thunder.
"There's nothing wrong with Malfoy's arm!" said Harry furiously. "He's
faking it!"
"I know that, but we can't prove it," said Wood bitterly, "And we've
been practicing all those moves assuming we're playing Slytherin, and
instead it's Hufflepuff, and their style's quite different. They've got
a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory --"
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.
"What?" said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.
"He's that tall, good-looking one, isn't he?" said Angelina.
"Strong and silent," said Katie, and they started to giggle again.
"He's only silent because he's too thick to string two words together,"
said Fred impatiently. "I don't know why you're worried, Oliver,
Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the
Snitch in about five minutes, remember?"
"We were playing in completely different conditions!" Wood shouted, his
eyes bulging slightly. "Diggory's put a very strong side together! He's
an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you'd take it like this! We mustn't
relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! We
must win!"
"Oliver, calm down!" said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. "We're taking
Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously."
The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain
fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and
classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team
was looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy.
"Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!" he sighed as the gale
outside pounded the windows.
Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match
tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and
giving
him tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that
Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the
Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, "Diggory's
got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him --"
Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts
classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.
"Sorry I'm late, Professor Lupin. I --"
But it wasn't Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher's
desk; it was Snape.
"This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we'll make it ten
points from Gryffindor. Sit down."
But Harry didn't move.
"Where's Professor Lupin?" he said.
"He says he is feeling too ill to teach today," said Snape with a
twisted smile. "I believe I told you to sit down?"
But Harry stayed where he was.
"What's wrong with him?"
Snape's black eyes glittered.
"Nothing life-threatening," he said, looking as though he wished it
were. "Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit
down again, it will be fifty."
Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the
class.
"As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left
any record of the topics you have covered so far --"
"Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,"
said Hermione quickly, "and we're just about to start --"
"Be quiet," said Snape coldly. "I did not ask for information. I was
merely commenting on Professor Lupin's lack of organization."
"He's the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had,"
said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the
rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.
"You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I ,Would
expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows.
Today we shall discuss --"
Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter,
which he must know they hadn't covered.
"Werewolves," said Snape.
"But, sir," said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, "we're
not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --"
"Miss Granger," said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, "I was under the
impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you
all to turn to page 394." He glanced around again. 'All of you! Now!"
With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class
opened their books.
"Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and
the true wolf?" said Snape.
Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose
hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air.
"Anyone?" Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back.
"Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you the
basic distinction between --"
"We told you," said Parvati suddenly, "we haven't got as far as
werewolves yet, we're still on --"
"Silence!" snarled Snape. "Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a
third-year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw
one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very
behind you all are...."
"Please, sir," said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, "the
werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of
the werewolf --"
"That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,"
said Snape coolly. "Five more points from Gryffindor for being an
insufferable know-it-all."
Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with
her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed
Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had
called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione
she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, "You asked us
a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be
told?"
The class knew instantly he'd gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron
slowly, and the room held its breath.
"Detention, Weasley," Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron's.
"And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you
will be very sorry indeed."
No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made
notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and
down
the rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor
Lupin.
"Very poorly explained... That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly
found in Mongolia.... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I
wouldn't have given it three...."
When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.
"You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you
recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment or, the
subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took
this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your
detention."
Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited
until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade
about Snape.
"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the
Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job," Harry said to
Hermione. "Why's he got it in for Lupin? D'you think this is all because
of the boggart?"
"I don't know," said Hermione pensively. "But I really hope Professor
Lupin gets better soon...."
Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage.
"D'you know what that --" (he called Snape something that made
Hermione
say "Ron!") "-- is making me do? I've got to scrub out the bedpans in
the hospital wing. Without magic!" He was breathing deeply, his fists
clenched. "Why couldn't Black have hidden in Snape's office, eh? He
could have finished him off for us!"
Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was till
dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him.
Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright
-- Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in
his ear.
"What did you do that for?" said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his
cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.
Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past
four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but
it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of
the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the
castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden
Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling
through that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got
up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out
of the dormitory.
As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent
down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and
drag him outside.
"You know, I reckon Ron was right about you," Harry told Crookshanks
suspiciously. "There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and
chase them. Go on," he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral
staircase with his foot. "Leave Scabbers alone."
The noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn. Harry knew
better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches
weren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he was
starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory
to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than
Harry. Seekers were usually light
and speedy, but Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather
because he was less likely to be blown off course.
Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up
every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up
the boys, staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time
for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.
"Stand and fight, you mangy cur!" yelled Sir Cadogan.
"Oh, shut up," Harry yawned.
He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he'd
started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up.
"It's going to be a tough one," said Wood, who wasn't eating anything.
"Stop worrying, Oliver," said Alicia soothingly, "we don't mind a bit of
rain."
But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity
of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as
usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads
bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their
hands as they went. just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an
enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.
The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual
pre-match pep talk, but it didn't come. He tried to speak several times,
made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned
them to follow him.
The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out
onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn't hear it over
the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses.
How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?
The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field,
wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to eacb other and
shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood no, looked as though he
had
lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the
words,
"Mount Your brooms.,, He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a
squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put
her
whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant
they were off
Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He
held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.
Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able
to see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and
forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no
idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn't hear the
commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks
and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by
a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he
hadn't seen them coming.
He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his
broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided
to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing
whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the
rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart....
With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch's
whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick
rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the
mud.
"I called for time-out!" Wood roared at his team. "Come on, under here
--"
They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took
off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.
"What's the score?"
"We're fifty points up," said Wood, "but unless we get the Snitch soon,
we'll be playing into the night."
"I've got no chance with these on," Harry said exasperatedly, waving his
glasses.
At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding
her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.
"I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!"
He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione
tapped them with her wand and said, "Impervius!"
"There!" she said, handing them back to Harry. "They'll repel water!"
Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.
"Brilliant!" he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the
crowd. "Okay, team, let's go for it!"
Hermione's spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold,
still wetter than he'd ever been in his life, but he could see. Full of
fresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air,
staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking
beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction....
There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked
lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get
the Snitch quickly -
He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at
that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and
Harry saw something that distracted him completely , the silhouette of
an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky,
motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.
Harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped
a
few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back
into the stands. The dog had vanished.
"Harry!" came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts.
"Harry, behind you!"
Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and
a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them
-
With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and
zoomed toward the Snitch.
"Come on!" he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face.
'Taster!"
But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the
stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It
was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had
gone
suddenly deaf -- what was going on?
And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him,
just as he became aware of something moving on the field below...
Before he'd had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch
and looked down.
At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him,
were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising
in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again....
Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head... a woman...
"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!"
"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now...."
"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --"
Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain.... What was he
doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her... She was going to
die.... She was going to be murdered....
He was falling, falling through the icy mist.
"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy....
A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew
no
more.
"Lucky the ground was so soft."
"I thought he was dead for sure."
"But he didn't even break his glasses."
Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense
whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there,
or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every
inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.
"That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life."
Scariest... the scariest thing... hooded black figures... cold ...
screaming...
Harry's eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The
Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was
gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as
though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool.
"Harry!" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud.
"How're you feeling?"
It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning --
the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors...
"What happened?" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.
"You fell off," said Fred. "Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?"
"We thought you'd died," said Alicia, who was shaking.
Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely
bloodshot.
"But the match," said Harry. "What happened? Are we doing a replay?"
No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.
"We didn't -- lose?"
"Diggory got the Snitch," said George. "Just after you fell. He didn't
realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the
ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and
square... even Wood admits it."
"Where is Wood?" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.
"Still in the showers," said Fred. "We think he's trying to drown
himself."
Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred
grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.
"C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch before."
"There had to be one time you didn't get it," said George.
"It's not over yet," said Fred. "We lost by a hundred points"
"Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and
Slytherin --."
"Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points," said
George.
"But if they beat Ravenclaw..."
"No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against
Hufflepuff..."
"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way."
Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost... for the first time
ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.
After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to
leave him in peace.
"We'll come and see you later," Fred told him. "Don't beat yourself up,
Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had."
The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the
door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer
to
Harry's bed.
"Dumbledore was really angry," Hermione said in a quaking voice. "I've
never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell,
waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground.
Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.
They left the stadium right away... He was furious they'd come onto the
grounds. We heard him --"
"Then he magicked you onto a stretcher," said Ron. "And walked up to
school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --"
His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what
the dementors had done to him... about the screaming voice. He looked up
and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly
cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.
"Did someone get my Nimbus?"
Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.
"Er --"
"What?" said Harry, looking from one to the other.
"Well... when you fell off, it got blown away," said Hermione
hesitantly.
"And?"
"And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow."
Harry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree
that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.
"And?" he said, dreading the answer.
"Well, you know the Whomping Willow," said Ron. "It -- it doesn't like
being hit."
"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said
Hermione in a very small voice.
Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down,
and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the
only remains of Harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick.
CHAPTER TEN
THE MARAUDER'S MAP
Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the
rest of the weekend. He didn't argue or complain, but he wouldn't let
her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He
knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but
Harry couldn't help it; he felt as though he'd lost one of his best
friends.
He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent
him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and
Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she
had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his
bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this
time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of
voice) that he didn't blame
him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at
night- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better,
because they knew only half of what was troubling him.
He hadn't told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -and Hermione,
because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact
remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances
had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly
been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his
broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was
he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the
beast?
And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every
time he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but
no one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heard
echoes in their head of their dying parents.
Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had
heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours
in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of
moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heard
the last moments of his mother's life, her attempts to protect him,
Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort's laughter before he
murdered
her.... Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted
hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his
mother's voice.
It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on
Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve', if he had
to endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with
glee at Gryffindor's defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and
celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited
imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their
next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron
finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy,
which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from
Gryffindor.
"If Snape's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I'm skiving
off," said Ron as they headed toward Lupin's classroom after lunch.
"Check who's in there, Hermione."
Hermione peered around the classroom door.
"It's okay!"
Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had
been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were
dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as
they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of
complaints about Snape's behavior while Lupin had been ill.
"It's not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?"
"We don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment!"
"Did you tell Professor Snape we haven't covered them yet?" Lupin asked,
frowning slightly.
The babble broke out again.
"Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen --"
"-- two rolls of parchment!"
Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.
"Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the
essay."
"Oh no," said Hermione, looking very disappointed. "I've already
finished it!"
They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a
glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who
looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and
harmless looking.
"Lures travelers into bogs," said Professor Lupin as they took notes.
"You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -people
follow the light -- then --"
The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.
When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the
door, Harry among them, but --
"Wait a moment, Harry," Lupin called. "I'd like a word."
Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the
hinkypunk's
box with a cloth.
"I heard about the match," said Lupin, turning back to his desk and
starting to pile books into his briefcase, "and I'm sorry about your
broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?"
"No," said Harry. "The tree smashed it to bits."
Lupin sighed.
"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at
Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch
the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye,
and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance."
"Did you hear about the dementors too?" said Harry with difficulty.
Lupin looked at him quickly.
"Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that
angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his
refusal to let them inside the grounds.... I suppose they were the
reason you fell?"
"Yes," said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask
burst from him before he could stop himself." Why? Why do they affect
me
like that? Am I just --?"
"It has nothing to do with weakness," said Professor Lupin sharply, as
though he had read Harry's mind. "The dementors affect you worse than
the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't
have."
A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating
Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face.
"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They
infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair,
they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even
Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a
dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out
of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce
you to something like itself... soul-less and evil. You'll be left with
nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that
happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom.
You have nothing to feel ashamed of."
"When they get near me --" Harry stared at Lupin's desk, his throat
tight. "I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum."
Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry's
shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment's Silence, then
--
"Why did they have to come to the match?" said Harry bitterly.
"They're getting hungry," said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with
a snap. "Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of
human prey has dried up.... I don't think they could resist the large
crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotions
running high... it was their idea of a feast."
"Azkaban must be terrible," Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.
"The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't
need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all
trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought.
Most of them go mad within weeks."
"But Sirius Black escaped from them," Harry said slowly. "He got
away..."
Lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to
catch it.
"Yes," he said, straightening up, "Black must have found a way to fight
them. I wouldn't have believed it possible.... Dementors are supposed to
drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long...."
"You made that dementor on the train back off," said Harry suddenly.
"There are -- certain defenses one can use," said Lupin. "But there was
only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult
it becomes to resist."
"What defenses?" said Harry at once. "Can you teach me?"
"I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the
contrary..."
"But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able
to fight them --"
Lupin looked into Harry's determined face, hesitated, then said,
"Well... all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next
term, I'm afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very
inconvenient time to fall ill."
What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought
that he might never have to hear his mother's death again, and the fact
that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end
of November, Harry's mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not
out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose
another match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and
worked
his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into
December. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds.
Dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the
entrances.
Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a
dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one
morning
covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of
Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had
already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out
to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing
their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to
remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn't stand
two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the
library, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him company,
and he was very grateful.
To everyone's delight except Harry's, there was to be another Hogsmeade
trip on the very last weekend of the term.
"We can do all our Christmas shopping there!" said Hermione. "Mum and
Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from
Honeydukes!"
Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind
again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and
decided
to spend the day reading up on the different makes. He had been riding
one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star,
which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his
own.
On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to
Ron
and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up
the
marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow
had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still
and quiet.
"Psst -- Harry!"
He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and
George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, oneeyed
witch.
"What are you doing?" said Harry curiously. "How come you're not going
to Hogsmeade?"
"We've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go," said Fred,
with a mysterious wink. "Come in here...."
He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue.
Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly
and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.
"Early Christmas present for you, Harry," he said.
Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it
on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of
parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and
George's jokes, stared at it.
"What's that supposed to be?"
"This, Harry, is the secret of our success," said George, patting the
parchment fondly.
"It's a wrench, giving it to you," said Fred, "but we decided last
night, your need's greater than ours."
"Anyway, we know it by heart," said George. "We bequeath it to you. We
don't really need it anymore."
"And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?" said Harry.
"A bit of old parchment!" said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as
though Harry had mortally offended him. "Explain, George."
"Well... when we were in our first year, Harry -- young, carefree, and
innocent --"
Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been
innocent.
"Well, more innocent than we are now -- we got into a spot of bother
with Filch."
"We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason
--"
"So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the
usual --" detention disembowelment and we couldn't help noticing a
drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly
Dangerous.
"Don't tell me --" said Harry, starting to grin.
"Well, what would you've done?" said Fred. "George caused a diversion
by
dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed --
this."
"It's not as bad as it sounds, you know," said George. "We don't reckon
Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was,
though, or he wouldn't have confiscated it."
"And you know how to work it?"
"Oh yes," said Fred, smirking. "This little beauty's taught us more than
all the teachers in this school."
"You're winding me up," said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of
parchment.
"Oh, are we?" said George.
He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, "I
solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider's web from the
point that George's wand had touched. They joined each other, they
crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words
began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that
proclaimed:
Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs
Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present THE
MARAUDER'S MAP
It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds.
But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it,
each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent
over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor
Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker's cat, Mrs. Norris, was
prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently
bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry's eyes traveled up and
down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of
them
seemed to lead -
"Right into Hogsmeade," said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.
"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four" -- he
pointed them out -- "but we're sure we're the only ones who know about
these. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor.
We used it until last winter, but it's caved in -- completely blocked.
And we don't reckon anyone's ever used this one, because the Whomping
Willow's planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one
leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We've used it loads of times.
And as you might've noticed, the entrance is right outside this room,
through that one-eyed old crone's hump."
"Moony, Wormtaill Padfoot, and Prongs," sighed George, patting the
heading of the map. "We owe them so much."
"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,"
said Fred solemnly.
"Right," said George briskly. "Don't forget to wipe it after you've used
it or anyone can read it," Fred said warningly.
"Just tap it again and say, 'Mischief managed!' And it'll go blank."
"So, young Harry," said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy,
"mind you behave yourself."
"See you in Honeydukes," said George, winking.
They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.
Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink
Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If
Filch really didn't know... he wouldn't have to pass the dementors at
all....
But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had
once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory.
Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where
it keeps its brain.
This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had
been
warning against.... Aids for Magical Mischief Makers... but then, Harry
reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn't as
though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone... and Fred and
George had been using it for years without anything horrible
happening....
Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.
Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map,
stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom.
He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very
carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the
one-eyed witch.
What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his
astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry
Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was
standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.
Harry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the
witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and
tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The
tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside
said, "Dissendium."
"Dissendium!" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.
At once, the statue's hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin
person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the
map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed
himself forward.
He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then
landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was
pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, "Lumos! " and saw that he was
in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it
with the tip of his wand, and muttered, "Mischief managed!" The map
went
blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then,
heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.
The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit
than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on
the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.
It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him.
After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry
sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.
Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which
rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began
to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he
climbed, watching his feet.... Then, without warning, his head hit
something hard.
It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his
head, listening. He couldn't hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he
pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.
He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry
climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it -- it blended so perfectly
with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry
crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could
definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the
opening and shutting of a door.
Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much
closer
at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.
"And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they've nearly cleaned us out
--" said a woman's voice.
A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an
enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard the man
shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get another
chance --
Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed
the stairs; looking back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald
head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs,
slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes
-- he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.
Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked
twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a
laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley's piggy face
if he could see where Harry was now.
There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets
imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of
coconut
ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of
chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans,
and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron
had mentioned; along yet another wall were "Special Effects" -- sweets:
Droobles Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-colored
bubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery
Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps ("breathe fire for
your friends!"), Ice Mice ("hear your teeth chatter and squeak!"),
peppermint creams shaped like toads ("hop realistically in the
stomach!"), fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons.
Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign
hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and
Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored
lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.
"Ugh, no, Harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, I
expect," Hermione was saying.
"How about these?" said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under
Hermione's nose.
"Definitely not," said Harry.
Ron nearly dropped the jar.
"Harry!" squealed Hermione. "What are you doing here? How -- how did
you
--?"
"Wow!" said Ron, looking very impressed, "you've learned to Apparate!"
"'Course I haven't," said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of
the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder's
Map.
"How come Fred and George never gave it to me!" said Ron, outraged.
"I'm
their brother!"
"But Harry isn't going to keep it!" said Hermione, as though the idea
were ludicrous. "He's going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall,
aren't you, Harry?"
"No, I'm not!" said Harry.
"Are you mad?" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. "Hand in something that
good?"
"If I hand it in, I'll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred
and George had nicked it!"
"But what about Sirius Black?" Hermione hissed. "He could be using one
of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have
got to know!"
"He can't be getting in through a passage," said Harry quickly. "There
are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch
already knows about four of them. And of the other three -- one of
them's caved in, so no one can get through it. one of them's got the
Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can't get out of it.
And the one I just came through -well - - it's really hard to see the
entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there..."
Harry hesistated. What if Black did know the passage was there?
Ron, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice
pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door.
--------BY ORDER OF -------- THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Customers are reminded that until further notice, dementors will be
patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade every night after sundown. This
measure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and
will be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is therefore
advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall.
Merry Christmas!
"See?" said Ron quietly. "I'd like to see Black try and break into
Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Anyway,
Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn't they?
They live over the shop!"
"Yes, but but --" Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another
problem. "Look, Harry still shouldn't be coming into Hogsmeade. He
hasn't got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he'll be in so much
trouble! And it's not nightfall yet -- what if Sirius Black turns up
today? Now?"
"He'd have a job spotting Harry in this," said Ron, nodding through the
mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. "Come on, Hermione, it's
Christmas. Harry deserves a break."
Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.
"Are you going to report me?" Harry asked her, grinning.
"Oh -- of course not -- but honestly, Harry --"
"Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?" said Ron, grabbing him and leading
him over to their barrel. "And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred
gave me one of those when I was seven -- it burnt a hole right through
my tongue. I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick." Ron
stared
broodingly into the Acid Pop box. "Reckon Fred'd take a bit of Cockroach
Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?"
When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them
left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside.
Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and
shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly
wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the
trees.
Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn't have his cloak. They
headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione
shouting through their scarves.
"That's the post office
"Zonko's is up there --"
"We could go up to the Shrieking Shack
"Tell you what," said Ron, his teeth chattering, "shall we go for a
butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?"
Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were
freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering
the tiny inn.
It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort of
woman
with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock' up at the bar.
"That's Madam Rosmerta," said Ron. "I'll get the drinks, shall I?" he
added, going slightly red.
Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, ,,her, there
was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas
tree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minutes
later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer.
"Merry Christmas!" he said happily, raising his tankard.
Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he'd ever tasted and
seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside.
A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had
opened again. Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked.
Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a
flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in
conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a
pinstriped cloak -- Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of
Harry's head and forced him off his stool and under the table. Dripping
with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his empty
tankard and watched the teachers' and Fudge's feet move toward the bar,
pause, then turn and walk right toward him.
Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, Mobiliarbus!"
The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground,
drifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in front of their
table, hiding them from view. Staring through the dense lower branches,
Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside
theirs, then heard the grunts and sighs If the teachers and minister as
they sat down.
Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels,
and heard a woman's voice. "A small gillywater --"
"Mine," said Professor McGonagall's voice.
"Four pints of mulled mead --"
"Ta, Rosmerta," said Hagrid.
"A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella --"
"Mmm!" said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.
"So you'll be the red currant rum, Minister."
"Thank you, Rosmerta, m'dear," said Fudge's voice. "Lovely to see you
again, I must say. Have one yourself, won't you? Come and join us...."
"Well, thank you very much, Minister."
Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His heart
was pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn't it occurred to him
that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers And how long
were they going to sit there? He needed time to sneak back into
Honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight.... Hermione's leg
gave a nervous twitch next to him.
"So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?" came Madam
Rosmerta's voice.
Harry saw the lower part of Fudge's thick body twist in his chair as
though he were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet
voice, "What else, m'dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what
happened up at the school at Halloween?"
I did hear a rumor," admitted Madam Rosmerta.
"Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?" said Professor McGonagall
exasperatedly.
"Do you think Blacks still in the area, Minister?" whispered Madam
Rosmerta.
"I'm sure of it," said Fudge shortly.
"You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjce?"
said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice. "Scared all my
customers away... It's very bad for business, Minister."
"Rosmerta, dear, I don't like them any more than you do," said Fudge
uncomfortably. "Necessary precaution... unfortunate, but there YOU
are.... I've just met some of them. They're in a fury against Dumbledore
-- he won't let them inside the castle grounds."
"I should think not," said Professor McGonagall sharply. "How are we
supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?"
"Hear, hear!" squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling
a foot from the ground.
"All the same," demurred Fudge, "they are here to protect you all from
something much worse.... We all know what Black's capable of..."
"Do you know, I still have trouble believing it," said Madam Rosmerta
thoughtfully. "Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius
Black was the last I'd have thought... I mean, I remember him when he
was a boy at Hogwarts. If you'd told me then what he was going to
become, I'd have said you'd had too much mead."
"You don't know the half of it, Rosmerta," said Fudge gruffly. "The
worst he did isn't widely known."
"The worst?" said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity,
"Worse
than murdering all those poor people, you mean?"
"I certainly do," said Fudge.
"I ca'A believe that. What could possibly be worse?" "You say you
remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta," mur- mured Professor
McGonagall.
"Do you remember who his-best friend was?"
"Naturally," said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. "Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here --
ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and
James Potter!"
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
"Precisely," said Professor McGonagall. "Black and Potter. Ringleaders
of their little gang. Both very bright, of course -- exceptionally
bright, in fact -- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of
troublemakers --"
"I dunno," chuckled Hagrid. "Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a
run fer their money."
"You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!" chimed in Professor
Flitwick. "Inseparable!"
"Of course they were," said Fudge. "Potter trusted Black beyond all his
other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man
when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry
has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him."
"Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?"
whispered
Madam Rosmerta.
"Worse even than that, rn'dear...." Fudge dropped his voice and
proceeded in a sort of low rumble. "Not many people are aware that the
Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of
course
working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies.
One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He
advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't
an
easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance
was the Fidelius Charm."
"How does that work?" said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest.
Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.
"An immensely complex spell," he said squeakily, "involving the magical
concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is
hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth
impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to
divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who
could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and
never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their
sitting room window!"
"So Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?" whispered Madam Rosmerta.
"Naturally," said Professor McGonagall. "James Potter told Dumbledore
that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was
planning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained
worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeper
himself."
"He suspected Black?" gasped Madam Rosmerta.
"He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping
You-Know-Who informed of their movements," said Professor
McGonagall
darkly. "Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side
had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to
You-Know-Who."
"But James Potter insisted on using Black?"
"He did," said Fudge heavily. "And then, barely a week after the
Fidelius Charm had been performed --" "Black betrayed them?" breathed
Madam Rosmerta.
"He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready
to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have
planned this for the moment of the Potters' death. But, as we all know,
You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone,
horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position
indeed. His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had
shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it
--"
"Filthy, stinkin' turncoat!" Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar
went quiet.
"Shh!" said Professor McGonagall.
"I met him!" growled Hagrid. "I musta bin the last ter see him before he
killed all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an'
James's house after they was killed! jus' got him outta the ruins, poor
little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an' his parents
dead... an' Sirius Black turns up, on that flyin' motorbike he used ter
ride. Never occurred ter me what he was doin' there. I didn' know he'd
bin Lily an' James's Secret-Keeper. Thought he'd jus' heard the news o'
You-Know-Who's attack an' come ter see what he could do. White an'
shakin', he was. An' yeh know what I did? I COMFORTED THE
MURDERIN'
TRAITOR!" Hagrid roared.
"Hagrid, please!" said Professor McGonagall. "Keep your voice down!"
"How was I ter know he wasn' upset abou' Lily an' James? It was
You-Know-Who he cared abou'! An' then he says, 'Give Harry ter me,
Hagrid, I'm his godfather, I'll look after him --' Ha! But I'd had me
orders from Dumbledore, an' I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was
ter go ter his aunt an' uncle's. Black argued, but in the end he gave
in. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. 'I won't need it
anymore,' he says.
"I shoulda known there was somethin' fishy goin' on then. He loved that
motorbike, what was he givin' it ter me for? Why wouldn' he need it
anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he'd bin
the Potters' Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin' ter have ter run fer
it that night, knew it was a matter o' hours before the Ministry was
after him.
"But what if I'd given Harry to him, eh? I bet he'd 've pitched him off
the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes' friends' son! But when a wizard
goes over ter the Dark Side, there's nothin' and no one that matters to
em anymore...."
A long silence followed Hagrid's story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with
some satisfaction, "But he didn't manage to disappear, did he? The
Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day!"
"Alas, if only we had," said Fudge bitterly. "It was not we who found
him. It was little Peter Pettigrew -- another of the Potters' friends.
Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the
Potters' Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself."
"Pettigrew... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after
them at Hogwarts?" said Madam Rosmerta.
"Hero-worshipped Black and Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "Never
quite in their league, talent-wise. I was often rather ,harp with him.
You can imagine how I -how I regret that now..." She sounded as though
she had a sudden head cold.
"There, now, Minerva," said Fudge kindly, "Pettigrew died a hero's
death. Eyewitnesses -- Muggles, of course, we wiped their, memories
later -- told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing,
'Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?' And then he went for his wand.
Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens...."
Professor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly, "Stupid boy ...
foolish boy... he was always hopeless at dueling... should have left it
to the Ministry...."
"I tell yeh, if I'd got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I
wouldn't 've messed around with wands -- I'd 've ripped him limb -- from
-- limb," Hagrid growled.
"You don't know what you're talking about, Hagrid," said Fudge sharply.
"Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement
Squad
would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I was
Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time,
and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those
people. I -- I will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A
crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewer
below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing there
laughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him... a heap of
bloodstained robes and a few -- a few fragments --"
Fudge's voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being
blown.
"Well, there you have it, Rosmerta," said Fudge thickly. "Black was
taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement 'Squad
and
Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I think was
some comfort to his poor mother. Blades been in Azkaban ever since."
Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.
"Is it true he's mad, Minister?"
"I wish I could say that he was," said Fudge slowly. "I certainly
believe his master's defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of
Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and
desperate man -- cruel... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last
inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit
muttering to themselves in the dark; there's no sense in them... but I
was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to
me.
It was unnerving. You'd have thought he was merely bored -- asked if I'd
finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the
crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementors
seemed to be having on him -- and he was one of the most heavily guarded
in the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day and night."
"But what do you think he's broken out to do?" said Madam Rosmerta.
"Good gracious, Minister, he isn't trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is
he?"
I daresay that is his -- er -- eventual plan," said Fudge evasively.
"But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who
alone and friendless is one thing... but give him back his most devoted
servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again...."
There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their
glass.
"You know, Cornelius, if you're dining with the headmaster, he'd better
head back up to the castle," said Professor McGonagall.
One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their
owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight, and Madam
Rosemerta's
glittering heels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the Three
Broomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and the
teachers had disappeared.
"Harry?"
Ron's and Hermione's faces appeared under the table. They were both
staring at him, lost for words.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
THE FIREBOLT
Harry didn't have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back
into the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once
more. All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at
all, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head was
still pounding with the conversation he had just heard.
Why had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. Weasley,
Cornelius
Fudge... why hadn't anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry's parents
had died because their best friend had betrayed them?
Ron and Herinione watched Harry nervously all through dintier, not
daring to talk about what they'd overheard, because Percy was sitting
close by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, it
was to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit
of end- of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn't want Fred and George
asking him whether he'd reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to
the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. He
pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for -- the
leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which
was
full of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his
bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages,
searching, until...
He stopped on a picture of his parents' wedding day. There was his
father waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had
inherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alight
with happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there ... that must be him.
Their best man... Harry had never given him a thought before.
If he hadn't known it was the same person, he would never have guessed
it was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn't sunken and waxy,
but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working for
Voldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the
deaths of the two people next to him? Did he realize he was facing
twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make him
unrecognizable?
But the dementors don't affect him, Harry thought, staring into the
handsome, laughing face. He doesn't have to hear my Min screaming if
they get too close -
Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his
cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the
hangings were hiding him from view.
The dormitory door opened.
"Harry?" said Ron's voice uncertainly.
But Harry still, pretending to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and
rolled over on his back, his eyes wide open.
A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry
like poison. He could see Black laughing at him through the darkness, as
though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes. He
watched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius
Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into
a
thousand pieces. He could hear (though having no idea what Black's voice
might sound like) a low, excited mutter. "It has happened, My Lord...
the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper and then came another
voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his head
whenever the dementors drew near....
"Harry, you -- you look terrible."
Harry hadn't gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had awoken to find the
dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a
common room that was completely empty except for Ron, who was eating
a
Peppermint Toad and massaging his stomach, and Hermione, who had
spread
her homework over three tables.
"Where is everyone?" said Harry.
"Gone! It's the first day of the holidays, remember?" said Ron, watching
Harry closely. "It's nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you
up in a minute."
Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling
outside the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire
like a large, ginger rug.
"You really don' look well, you know," Hermione said, peering anxiously
into his face.
"I'm fine," said Harry.
"Harry, listen," said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, you must be
really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you
mustn't go doing anything stupid."
"Like what?" said Harry.
"Like trying to go after Black," said Ron sharply.
Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been
asleep. He didn't say anything.
"You won't, will you, Harry?" said Hermione.
"Because Black's not worth dying for," said Ron.
Harry looked at them. They didn't seem to understand at all.
"D'you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near
me?"
Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. "I can hear
my
mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you'd heard your
mum
screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn't forget it in
a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of
hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her --"
"There's nothing you can do!" said Hermione, looking stricken. "The
dementors will catch Black and he'll go back to Azkaban and -- and serve
him right!"
"You heard what Fudge said. Black isn't affected by Azkaban like normal
people are. It's not a punishment for him like it is for the others."
"So what are you saying?" said Ron, looking very tense. "You want to --
to kill Black or something?"
"Don't be silly," said Herinione in a panicky voice. "Harry doesn't want
to kill anyone, do you, Harry?"
Again, Harry didn't answer. He didn't know what he wanted to do. All he
knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was
almost more than he could stand.
Malfoy knows," he said abruptly. "Remember what he said to me in
Potions? 'If it was me, I'd hunt him down myself... I'd want revenge.
"You're going to take Malfoy's advice instead of ours?" said Ron
furiously. "Listen... you know what Pettigrew's mother got back after
Black had finished with him? Dad told me -- the Order of Merlin, First
Class, and Pettigrew's finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him
they could find. Black's a madman, Harry, and he's dangerous --"
"Malfoy's dad must have told him," said Harry, ignoring Ron. "He was
right in Voldemort's inner circle --"
"Say You-Know-Who, will you?" interjected Ron angrily.
"-- so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort --"
"-- and Malfoy'd love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like
Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy's just hoping you'll get Yourself killed
before he has to play you at Quidditch."
"Harry, please," said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, "Please
be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don't Put
Yourself in danger, it's what Black wants.... Oh, Harry, you'd be
Playing right into Black's hands if you went looking for him. Your mum
and dad wouldn't want you to get hurt, would they? They'd never want you
to go looking for Black!"
"I'll never know what they'd have wanted, because thanks to Black, I've
never spoken to them," said Harry shortly.
There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing
his claws. Ron's pocket quivered.
"Look," said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject,
"it's the holidays! It's nearly Christmas! Let's -- let's go down and
see Hagrid. We haven't visited him for ages!"
"No!" said Hermione quickly. "Harry isn't supposed to leave the castle,
Ron --"
"Yeah, let's go," said Harry, sitting up, "and I can ask him how come he
never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!"
Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn't what Ron had had in
mind.
"Or we could have a game of chess, he said hastily, "or Gobstones. Percy
left a set --"
"No, let's visit Hagrid," said Harry firmly.
So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the
portrait hole ("Stand and fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!"), down
through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors.
They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in
the
glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks
soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been
enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid's cabin looked
like an iced cake.
Ron knocked, but there was no answer.
"He's not out, is he?" said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak.
Ron had his ear to the door.
"There's a weird noise," he said. "Listen -- is that Fang?"
Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin
came a series of low, throbbing moans.
"Think we'd better go and get someone?" said Ron nervously.
"Hagrid!" called Harry, thumping the door. "Hagrid, are you in there.
There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid
stood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down the
front of his leather vest.
"YWve heard?" he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry's neck.
Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no
laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid's weight, was
rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and
heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered
into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his
face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.
"Hagrid, what is it?" said Hermione, aghast.
Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.
"What's this, Hagrid?"
Hagrid's sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who
Picked it up and read aloud:
Dear Mr. Hagrid,
Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in
your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that
you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.
"Well, that's okay then, Hagrid!" said Ron, clapping Hagrid oil the
shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic
hands, inviting Harry to read on.
However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question.
We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy,
and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April
20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the
Committee's offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the
hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. Yours in fellowship...
There followed a list of the school governors.
"Oh," said Ron. "But you said Buckbeak isn't a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I
bet he'll get off
"Yeh don' know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o'
Dangerous Creatures!" choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve.
"They've got it in fer interestin' creatures!"
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid's cabin made Harry, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
"I couldn' leave him tied up out there in the snow!" choked Hagrid. "All
on his own! At Christmas."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called "interesting creatures" and
other people called "terrifying monsters." Or' the other hand, there
didn't seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid's
usual standards, he was positively cute.
"You'll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid," said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid's massive forearm. "I'm sure
you can prove Buckbeak is safe."
"Won't make no diff'rence!" sobbed Hagrid. "Them Disposal devils,
they're all in Lucius Malfoy's pocket! Scared o' him! Ad if I lose the
case, Buckbeak --"
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail
and lurched forward, his face in his arms.
"What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?" said Harry.
"He's done more'n enough fer me already," groaned Hagrid. "Got enough
on
his plate what with keepin' them dementors outta the castle, an' Sirius
Black lurkin' around --"
Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to
start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black. But
Harry couldn't bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so
miserable and scared.
"Listen, Hagrid," he said, "you can't give up. Hermione's right, You
just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses --"
"I'm sure I've read about a case of hippogriff-baiting," said Hermione
thoughtfully, "where the hippogriff got off I'll look it up for you,
Hagrid, and see exactly what happened."
Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to
help them.
"Er -- shall I make a cup of tea?" said Ron.
Harry stared at him.
"It's what my mum does whenever someone's upset," Ron muttered,
shrugging.
At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea
in front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a
tablecloth and said, "Yer right. I can' afford to go ter pieces. Gotta
pull meself together.....
Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his
head on Hagrid's knee.
"I've not bin meself lately," said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand
and mopping his face with the other. "Worried abou' Buckbeak, an' no one
likin' me classes --"
"We do like them!" lied Hermione at once.
"Yeah, they're great!" said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table.
"Er -- how are the flobberworms?"
"Dead," said Hagrid gloomily. "Too much lettuce."
"Oh no!" said Ron, his lip twitching.
"An' them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an' all," said Hagrid,
with a sudden shudder. "Gotta walk past 'em ev'ry time I want a drink in
the Three Broomsticks. 'S like bein' back in Azkaban --"
He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watched him
breathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in
Azkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, "Is it awful in
there, Hagrid?"
"Yeh've no idea," said Hagrid quietly. "Never bin anywhere like it.
Thought I was goin' mad. Kep' goin' over horrible stuff in me mind...
the day I got expelled from Hogwarts... day me dad died... day I had ter
let Norbert go...."
His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once
won in a game of cards.
"Yeh can' really remember who yeh are after a while. An' yeh can' really
see the point o' livin' at all. I used ter hope I'd jus' die in me
sleep. When they let me out, it was like bein' born again, ev'rythin' I
came floodin' back, it was the bes' feelin' in the world. Mind, the
dementors weren't keen on lettin' me go."
"But you were innocent!" said Hermione.
Hagrid snorted.
"Think that matters to them? They don' care. Long as they've got a
couple o' hundred humans stuck there with 'em, so they can leech all the
happiness out of 'em, they don' give a damn who's guilty an' who's not."
Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea. Then he said
quietly, "Thought o' jus' letting Buckbeak go... tryin' ter make him fly
away... but how d'yeh explain ter a hippogriff it's gotta go inter
hidin'? An' -an' I'm scared o' breakin' the law...." He looked up at
them, tears leaking down his face again. "I don' ever want ter go back
ter Azkaban."
The trip to Hagrid's, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the
effect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no means
forgotten about Black, he couldn't brood constantly on revenge if he
wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. He, Ron, and Hermione went to the
library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with
books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak. The three of them
sat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty
volumes about famous cases If marauding beasts, speaking occasionally
when they ran across something relevant.
"Here's something... there was a case in 1722... but the hippogriff was
convicted -- ugh, look what they did to it, that's disgusting --"
"This might help, look -- a manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they
let the manticore off -- oh -- no, that was only because everyone was
too scared to go near it."
Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas
decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the
students remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe
were strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside
every suit of armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve
Christmas trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and delicious
smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had
grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of
Ron's pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.
On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at
him.
"Oy! Presents!"
Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the
semi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had
appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.
'Another sweater from Mum... maroon again... see if you've got one.
Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the
Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince
pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all
these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.
"What's that?" said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of
maroon socks in his hand.
"Dunno..."
Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming
broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and
jumped off his bed for a closer look.
"I don't believe it," he said hoarsely.
It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see
every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He
could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at
exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the
golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the
perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.
"Who sent it to you?" said Ron in a hushed voice.
"Look and see if there's a card," said Harry.
Ron ripped apart the Firebolt's wrappings.
"Nothing! Blimey, who'd spend that much on you?"
"Well," said Harry, feeling stunned, "I'm betting it wasn't the
Dursleys."
I bet it was Dumbledore," said Ron, now walking around and around the
Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. "He sent you the Invisibility
Cloak anonymously...."
"That was my dad's, though," said Harry. "Dumbledore was just Passing it
on to me. He wouldn't spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can't go
giving students stuff like this --"
"That's why he wouldn't say it was from him!" said Ron. "In case some
git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry" -- Ron gave a great
whoop of laughter -- "Malfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He'll be
sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!"
"I can't believe this," Harry muttered, running a hand along the
Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry's bed, laughing his head off at the
thought of Malfoy. "Who -?"
"I know," said Ron, controlling himself, "I know who it could've been --
Lupin!"
"What?" said Harry, now starting to laugh himself "Lupin? Listen, if he
had this much gold, he'd be able to buy himself some new robes."
"Yeah, but he likes you," said Ron. "And he was away when your Nimbus
got smashed, and he might've heard about it and decided to visit Diagon
Alley and get this for you --"
"What d'you mean, he was away?" said Harry. "He was ill when I was
playing in that match."
"Well, he wasn't in the hospital wing," said Ron. "I was there, cleaning
out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?"
Harry frowned at Ron.
"I can't see Lupin affording something like this."
"What're you two laughing about?"
Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying
Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied
around his neck.
"Don't bring him in here!" said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from
the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.
But Hermione wasn't listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's
empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.
"Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?"
"No idea," said Harry. "There wasn't a card or anything with it."
To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or
intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her
lip.
"What's the matter with you?" said Ron.
"I don't know," said Hermione slowly, "but it's a bit odd, isn't it? I
mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't it?"
Ron sighed exasperatedly.
"It's the best broom there is, Hermione," he said.
"So it must've been really expensive...."
"Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together," said
Ron happily.
"Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even
tell him they'd sent it?" said Hermione.
"Who cares?" said Ron impatiently. "Listen, Harry, can I have a go on
it? Can I?"
"I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!" said Hermione
shrilly.
Harry and Ron looked at her.
"What d'you think Harry's going to do with it -- sweep the floor?" said
Ron.
But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus's
bed,
right at Ron's chest.
"GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks's
claws
ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his
shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at
Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking it
over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.
Crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tint,, whistling was
filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from
Uncle
Vernon's old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.
I forgot about that!" Harry said, bending down and picking up the
Sneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it....
The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was
hissing and spitting at it.
"You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione," said Ron furiously,
sitting on Harry's bed nursing his toe. "Can't you shut that thing up?"
he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks's
yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.
Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back
into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron's stifled moans of
pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron's hands. It had been a while
since Harry had seen him out of Ron's pocket, and he was unpleasantly
surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny;
patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too
"He's not looking too good, is he?" Harry said.
"It's stress!" said Ron. "He'd be fine if that big stupid furball left
him alone!"
But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had
said
about rats living only three years, couldn't help feeling that unless
Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of
his life. And despite Ron's frequent conplaints that Scabbers was both
boring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers
died.
Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor
common room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her
dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was
still fuming about Crookshanks's fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry
gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to
examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room
with him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she
didn't say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though
it too had been criticizing her cat.
At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House
tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table,
set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore,
McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch,
the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a
very old and rather moldy- looking tailcoat. There were only three other
students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced
Slytherin fifth year.
"Merry Christmas!" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione
approached the table. "As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to
use the House tables.... Sit down, sit down!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table.
"Crackers!" said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a
large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged.
With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large,
pointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vulture.
Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron's eye and they both grinned;
Snape's mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who
swapped it for his wizard's hat at once.
"Dig in!" he advised the table, beaming around.
As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great
Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as
though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the
occasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversized
dragonfly.
"Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!" said Dumbledore, standing up.
"I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster," said Professor Trelawney in
her mistiest, most faraway voice, "and to my astonishment, I saw myself
abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to
refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I
do beg you to forgive my lateness...."
"Certainly, certainly," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. "Let me
draw you up a chair --"
And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved
for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape
and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her
enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered
a kind of soft scream.
I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen!
Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine
together, the first to rise will be the first to die!"
"We'll risk it, Sibyll," said Professor McGonagall inpatiendy. "Do sit
down, the turkey's getting stone cold."
Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty
chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a
thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon
into the nearest tureen.
"Tripe, Sibyll?"
Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around
once
more and said, "But where is dear Professor Lupin?"
"I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again," said Dumbledore, indicating
that everybody should start serving themselves. "Most unfortunate that
it should happen on Christmas Day."
"But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?" said Professor McGonagall,
her eyebrows raised.
Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look.
"Certainly I knew, Minerva, 11 she said quietly. "But one does not
parade the fact that one is All- Knowing. I frequently act as though I
am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.
"That explains a great deal," said Professor McGonagall tartly.
Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.
"If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will
not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is
short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him --"
"Imagine that," said Professor McGonagall dryly.
I doubt," said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice,
which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney's
conversation, "that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus,
you've made the potion for him again?"
"Yes, Headmaster," said Snape. "W -- what?" said Harry, scrambling to
his feet. "Why?"
"It will need to be checked for jinxes," said Professor McGonagall. "Of
course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick
will strip it down --"
"Strip it down?" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.
"It shouldn't take more than a few weeks," said Professor McGonagall.
"You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free."
"There's nothing wrong with it!" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly.
"Honestly, Professor --"
"You can't know that, Potter," said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly,
"not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of
the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I
shall keep you informed."
Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of
the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after
her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron,
however, rounded on Hermione.
"What did you go running to McGonagall for?
Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood
up and faced Ron defiantly.
"Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that
that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!"
CHAPTER TWELVE
THE PATRONUS
Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn't stop him from
being angry with her. He had been the owner of the best broom in the
world for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, he
didn't know whether he would ever see it again. He was positive that
there was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state
would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx
tests?
Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was concerned, the
stripping-down of a brand- new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal
damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the
best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had
taken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade her to come back.
All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly
after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again.
Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started.
"Had a good Christmas?" he said, and then, without waiting for an
answer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, "I've been, doing some
thinking over Christmas, Harry. After last match, you know. If the
dementors come to the next one... I mean... we can't afford you to --
well --"
Wood broke off, looking awkward.
"I'm working on it," said Harry quickly. "Professor Lupin said he'd
train me to ward off the dementors. We should be starting this week. He
said he'd have time after Christmas."
"Ah," said Wood, his expression clearing. "Well, in that case -- I
really didn't want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a
new broom yet?"
"No," said Harry.
"What! You'd better get a move on, you know -- you can't ride that
Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!"
"He got a Firebolt for Christmas," said Ron.
"A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A -- a real Firebolt?"
"Don't get excited, Oliver," said Harry gloomily. "I haven't got it
anymore. It was confiscated." And he explained all about how the
Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes.
"Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?"
"Sirius Black" Harry said wearily. "He's supposed to be after me. So
McGonagall reckons he might have sent it."
Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his
Seeker, Wood said, "But Black couldn't have bought a Firebolt! He's on
the run! The whole country's on the lookout for him! How could he just
walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?"
"I know," said Harry, "but McGonagall still wants to strip it down --"
Wood went pale.
"I'll go and talk to her, Harry," he promised. "I'll make her see
reason.... A Firebolt... a real Firebolt, on our team... She wants
Gryffindor to win as much as we do.... I'll make her see sense. A
Firebolt..."
Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like
doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning,
but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their
enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood
and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards
scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first
Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor
Trelawney
was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry
that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.
It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to;
after his conversation with Wood, he wanted to get started on his
anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible.
"Ah yes," said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end
of class. "Let me see... how about eight o'clock on Thursday evening?
The History of Magic classroom should be large enough.... I'll have to
think carefully about how we're going to do this.... We can't bring a
real dementor into the castle to practice on...."
"Still looks ill, doesn't he?" said Ron as they walked down the
corridor, heading to dinner. "What d'you reckon's the matter with him?"
There was a loud and impatient "tuh" from behind them. It was Hermione,
who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag,
which was so full of books it wouldn't close.
"And what are you tutting at us for?" said Ron irritably.
"Nothing," said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her
shoulder.
"Yes, you were," said Ron. "I said I wonder what's wrong with Lupin, and
you --"
"Well, isn't it obvious?" said Hermione, with a look of maddening
superiority.
"If you don't want to tell us, don't," snapped Ron.
"Fine," said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.
"She doesn't know," said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. "She's
just trying to get us to talk to her again."
At eight o'clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for
the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived,
but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when
Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he
heaved onto Professor Binn's desk.
"What's that?" said Harry.
"Another boggart," said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. "I've been
combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this
one lurking inside Mr. Filch's filing cabinet. It's the nearest we'll
get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he
sees you, so we'll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my
office when we're not using him; there's a cupboard under my desk he'll
like."
"Okay," said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at
all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a
real dementor.
"So..." Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. "The spell I am going to try and teach you is
highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond ordinary Wizarding Level. It
is called the Patronus Charm."
"How does it work?" said Harry nervously.
"Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus," said Lupin,
"which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield
between you and the dementor."
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagridsized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, "The Patronus is
a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the
dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it
cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it.
But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for
you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it."
"What does a Patronus look like?" said Harry curiously.
"Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it."
"And how do you conjure it?"
"With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating,
with all your might, on a single, very happy memory."
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that
had happened to him at the Dursleys' was going to do. Finally, he
settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.
"Right," he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,
soaring sensation of his stomach.
"The incantation is this --" Lupin cleared his throat. "Expecto
patronum!"
"Expecto patronum, " Harry repeated under his breath, "expecto
patronum."
"Concentrating hard on your happy memory?"
"Oh -- yeah --" said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that
first broom ride. "Expecto patrono -- no, patronum -- sorry -- expecto
patronum, expecto patronum"
Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a
wisp of silvery gas.
"Did you see that?" said Harry excitedly. "Something happened!"
"Very good," said Lupin, smiling. "Right, then -- ready to try it on a
dementor?"
"Yes," Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the
middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying,
but something else kept intruding.... Any second now, he might hear his
mother again... but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again,
and he didn't want to... or did he?
Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.
A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward
Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around
the classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box
and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling
breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him --
"Expecto patronum!" Harry yelled. "Expecto patronum! Expecto --"
But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.... Harry was failing
again through thick white fog, and his mother's voice was louder than
ever, echoing inside his head -- "Not Harry! Not Harry! please -- I'll
do anything!"
"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!"
"Harry!"
Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor.
The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn't have to ask what had
happened.
"Sorry," he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down
behind his glasses.
"Are you all right?" said Lupin.
"Yes..." Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against
it.
"Here --" Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. "Eat this before we try
again. I didn't expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would
have been astounded if you had."
"It's getting worse," Harry muttered, biting off the Frog's head. "I
could hear her louder that time -- and him -- Voldemort
Lupin looked paler than usual. ,
"Harry, if you don't want to continue, I will more than understand --"
"I do!" said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog
into his mouth. "I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match
against Ravenclaw? I can't afford to fall off again. If we lose this
game we've lost the Quidditch Cup!"
"All right then... " said Lupin. "You might want to select 'other
memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on.... That one doesn't
seem to have been strong enough...."
Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the
House Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He
gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of
the classroom.
"Ready?" said Lupin, gripping the box lid.
"Ready," said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts
about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to
happen when the box opened.
"Go!" said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark
once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting
hand was extending toward Harry -
"Expecto patronum!" Harry yelled. "Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --"
White fog obscured his senses... big, blurred shapes were moving around
him... then came a new voice, a man's voice, shouting, panicking --
"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off --"
The sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room -- a door bursting open -- a
cackle of high- pitched laughter --
"Harry! Harry... wake up...."
Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute
before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor.
"I heard my dad," Harry mumbled. "That's the first time I've ever heard
him -- he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run
for it...."
Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with
the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his
robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn't see.
"You heard James?" said Lupin in a strange voice.
"Yeah..." Face dry, Harry looked up. "Why -- you didn't know my dad, did
you?"
"I -- I did, as a matter of fact," said Lupin. "We were friends at
Hogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight.
This charm is ridiculously advanced.... I shouln't have suggested
putting you through this...."
"No!" said Harry. He got up again. "I'll have one more go! I'm not
thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is.... Hang on...."
He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory... one that he could
turn into a good, strong Patronus...
The moment when he'd first found out he was a wizard, and would be
leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn't a happy memory, he
didn't know what was.... Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when
he'd realized he'd be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and
faced the packing case once more.
"Ready?" said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his
better judgment. "Concentrating hard? All right -- go!"
He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor
rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark
'EXPECTO PATRONUM!" Harry bellowed. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
"
The screaming inside Harry's head had started again -- except this time,
it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio -- softer
and louder and softer again -- and he could still see the dementor -- it
had halted -- and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the
end of Harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though
Harry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feet -- though for how
much longer, he wasn't sure --
"Riddikulus!" roared Lupin, springing forward.
There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with
the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd just
run a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, he
saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with
his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.
"Excellent!" Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. "Excellent,
Harry! That was definitely a start!"
"Can we have another go? Just one more go?"
"Not now," said Lupin firmly. "You've had enough for one night. Here --"
He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes' best chocolate.
"Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next
week?"
"Okay," said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin
extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the
dementor. A thought had just occurred to him.
"Professor Lupin?" he said. "If you knew my dad, you must've known
Sirius Black as well."
Lupin turned very quickly.
"What gives you that idea?" he said sharply.
"Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too...."
Lupin's face relaxed.
"Yes, I knew him," he said shortly. "Or I thought I did. You'd better be
off, Harry, it's getting late."
Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a
corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its
plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn't mentioned Black, as
Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry's thoughts
wandered back to his mother and father...
He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of
chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents' last moments
replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard
their voices since he was a very small child. But he'd never be able to
produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents
again....
"They're dead," he told himself sternly. "They're dead and listening to
echoes of them won't bring them back. You'd better get a grip on
yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup."
He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, and
headed back to Gryffindor Tower.
Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin
won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for
Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He
therefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek. This
meant that with Lupin's anti-dementor classes, which in themselves were
more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a
week to do all his homework. Even so, he was showing the strain nearly
as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be
getting
to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner
of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy
charts,
rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file
upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped
when she was interrupted.
"How's she doing it?" Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat
finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked
up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.
"Doing what?"
"Getting to all her classes!" Ron said. "I heard her talking to
Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going
on about yesterday's lesson, but Hermione can't 've been there, because
she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told
me
she's never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the
same time as Divination, and she's never missed one of them either!"
Harry didn't have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione's impossible
schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape's essay.
Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.
"Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the
Firebolt. She -- er -- got a bit shirty with me. Told m' I'd got my
priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup
than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn't care
if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first." Wood shook
his head in disbelief. "Honestly, the way she was yelling at me... you'd
think I'd said something terrible... then I asked her how much longer
she was going to keep it. He screwed up his face and imitated Professor
McGonagall's severe voice. 'As long as necessary, Wood'... I reckon it's
time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There's an order form at the back
of Which Broomstick... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One,
like
Malfoy's got."
"I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good," said Harry flatly.
January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the
bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer
and nearer, but Harry still hadn't ordered a new broom. He was now
asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every
Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione
rushing past with her face averted.
"No, Potter, you can't have it back yet," Professor McGonagall told him
the twelfth time this happened, before he'd even opened his mouth.
"We've checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick
believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you
once we've finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me."
To make matters even worse, Harry's anti-dementor lessons were not
going
nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to
produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementor
approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor
away. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harry
of energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself,
guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents' voices again.
"You're expecting too much of yourself," said Professor Lupin, sternly
in their fourth week of practice. "For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even
an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren't passing out
anymore, are you?"
I thought a Patronus would -- charge the dementors down or something,"
said Harry dispiritedly. "Make them disappear --"
"The true Patronus does do that," said Lupin. "But you've achieved a
great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an
appearance at your next Quidditch match, You will be able to keep them
at bay long enough to get back to the ground."
"You said it's harder if there are loads of them," said Harry.
"I have complete confidence in you," said Lupin, smiling. "Here --
you've earned a drink - something from the Three Broomsticks. You won't
have tried it before --"
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.
"Butterbeer!" said Harry, without thinking. "Yeah, I like that stuff!"
Lupin raised an eyebrow.
"Oh -Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade," Harry
lied
quickly.
I see," said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. "Well --
let's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I'm
supposed to take sides, as a teacher... " he added hastily
They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he'd
been wondering for a while.
"What's under a dementor's hood?"
Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.
"Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to
tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and
worst weapon."
"What's that?"
"They call it the Dementor's Kiss," said Lupin, with a slightly twisted
smile. "It's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I
suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they
clamp
their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his soul."
Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.
"What -- they kill --?"
"Oh no," said Lupin. "Much worse than that. You can exist without your
soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But
you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no. .. anything.
There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just exist. As an empty
shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost."
Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, "It's the fate that
awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The
Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find
him."
Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul
sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.
"He deserves it," he said suddenly.
"You think so?" said Lupin lightly. "Do you really think anyone deserves
that?"
"Yes," said Harry defiantly. "For... for some things..."
He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he'd
overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying
his mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he'd
gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn't be
very
impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and
left the History of Magic classroom.
Harry half wished that he hadn't asked what was under a dementor's hood,
the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant
thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you
that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.
"Do watch where you're going, Potter!"
"Sorry, Professor --"
"I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well,
here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn't
seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friend
somewhere, Potter...."
Harry's jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as
magnificent as ever.
"I can have it back?" Harry said weakly. "Seriously?"
"Seriously," said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. "I
daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won't
you? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of the
running for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kind
enough to remind me only last night...."
Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor
Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning
from ear to ear.
"She gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it?
Tomorrow?"
"Yeah... anything," said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a
month. "You know what -- we should make up with Hermione.... She was
only trying to help...."
"Yeah, all right," said Ron. "She's in the common room how working, for
a change --"
They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville
Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him
entrance.
"I wrote them down!" Neville was saying tearfully. "But I must've
dropped them somewhere!"
"A likely tale!" roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: "Good
even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying
to force entry to the chambers within!"
"Oh, shut up," said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville.
"I've lost the passwords!" Neville told them miserably. "I made him tell
me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps
changing them, and now I don't know what I've done with them!"
"Oddsbodikins," said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely
disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common
room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the
next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his
Firebolt.
"Where'd you get it, Harry?"
"Will you let me have a go?" "Have you ridden it yet, Harry?"
"Ravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on Cleansweep Sevens!"
"Can I just hold it, Harry?"
After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was Passed around and
admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a
clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over to them,
bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron
approached her table and at last, she looked up.
"I got it back," said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the
Firebolt.
"See, Hermione? There wasn't anything wrong with it!" said Ron.
"Well -- there might have been!" said Hermione. "I mean, at least you
know now that it's safe!"
"Yeah, I suppose so," said Harry. "Id better put it upstairs."
"I'll take it!" said Ron eagerly. "I've got to give Scabbers his rat
tonic."
He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass,
carried it away up the boys' staircase.
"Can I sit down, then?" Harry asked Hermione.
"I suppose so," said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a
chair.
Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay
on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies
essay ("Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity" and at the rune
translation Hermione was now poring over.
"How are you getting through all this stuff?" Harry asked her.
"Oh, well -- you know -- working hard," said Hermione. Close-up, Harry
saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin.
"Why don't you just drop a couple of subjects?" Harry asked, watching
her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary.
"I couldn't do that!" said Hermione, looking scandalized.
"Arithmancy looks terrible," said Harry, picking up a very
complicated-looking number chart.
"Oh no, it's wonderful!" said Hermione earnestly. "It's my favorite
subject! It's --"
But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found
out.
At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys'
staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the
entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder -- and
then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.
"LOOK!" he bellowed, striding over to Hermione's table.
"LOOK!" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.
"Ron, what --?"
"SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!"
Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry
looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it.
Something that looked horribly like --
"BLOOD!" Ron yelled into the stunned silence. "HE'S GONE! AND
YOU KNOW
WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?"
"N -- no," said Hermione in a trembling voice.
Ron threw something down onto Hermione's rune translation. Hermione
and
Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were
several long, ginger cat hairs.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW
It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione's friendship. Each was so
angry with the other that Harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up.
Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks's attempts
to
eat Scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on
him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by
suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys' beds.
Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that
Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been
there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat
ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the Magical
Menagerie.
Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and
when
he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that
way, she lost her temper with Harry too.
"Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!" she said shrilly. "First the
Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave me
alone, Harry, I've got a lot of work to do!"
Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.
"Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was," said
Fred bracingly. "And he's been off-color for ages, he was wasting away.
It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly -- one swallow -- he
probably didn't feel a thing."
"Fred!" said Ginny indignantly.
"All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself," said George.
"He bit Goyle for us once!" Ron said miserably. "Remember, Harry?"
"Yeah, that's true," said Harry.
"His finest hour," said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. "Let the
scar on Goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh,
come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what's
the point of moaning?"
In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come
along to the Gryffindor team's final practice before the Ravenclaw
match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they'd
finished. This did seem to take Ron's mind off Scabbers for a moment
("Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?") so they set off for
the Quidditch field together.
Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an
eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else
had been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the
benefit of her professional opinion.
"Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it's a
slight list to the tail end -- you often find they develop a drag after
a few years. They've updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the
Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows -- a Pity they've
stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom
it was too...."
She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, "Er -- Madam
Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to
practice...."
"Oh -- right -- here you are, then, Potter," said Madam Hooch. "I'll sit
over here with Weasley...."
She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor
team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow's
match.
"Harry, I've just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It's Cho
Chang. She's a fourth year, and she's pretty good.... I really hoped she
wouldn't be fit, she's had some problems with injuries...." Wood scowled
his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, "On
the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like
a joke next to the Firebolt." He gave Harry's broom a look of fervent
admiration, then said, "Okay, everyone, let's go -- "
And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the
ground.
It was better than he'd ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the
lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it
sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a
green-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet
screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the
grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into
the air again.
"Harry, I'm letting the Snitch out!" Wood called.
Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped
it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten
seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.
The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a
minute's head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the
others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell's knee, looped her easily,
and caught it again.
It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the
Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by
the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn't have a single criticism
to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.
"I can't see what's going to stop us tomorrow!" said Wood. "Not unless
-- Harry, you've sorted out your dementor problem, haven't you?"
"Yeah," said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were
stronger.
"The dementors won't turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore'd go ballistic,"
said Fred confidently.
"Well, let's hope not," said Wood. "Anyway -- good work, everyone. Let's
get back to the tower... turn in early --"
"I'm staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt," Harry told
Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms,
Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came
to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.
"Here you go," said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.
Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed
off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of
the field, watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke
with
a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that
they go back to the castle.
Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy
stadium, discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action, its
phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway
toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that
made his heart turn over -- a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the
darkness.
Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.
"What's the matter?" said Ron.
Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, "Lumos!"
A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and
illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was
Crookshanks.
"Get out of here!" Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone
lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks
had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.
"See?" Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. "She's still
letting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing down
Scabbers with a couple of birds now...."
Harry didn't say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped
through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged
to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. slightly ashamed of
his moment of panic, Harry didn't say anything to Ron -- nor did he look
left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys
in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a
sort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in
the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited
muttering. Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin
team were all looking thunderstruck.
"Did you see his face?" said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfay. "He
can't believe it! This is brilliant!"
Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.
"Put it here, Harry," he said, laying the broom in the middle of the
table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People
from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look.
Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such
a
superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy's Ravenclaw girlfriend,
Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.
"Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!" said Percy heartily as she examined the
Firebolt closely. "Penelope and I have got a bet on," he told the team.
"Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!"
Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to
her table.
"Harry -- make sure you win," said Percy, in an urgent whisper. "I
haven't got ten Galleons. Yes, I'm coming, Penny!" And-he bustled off to
join her in a piece of toast.
"Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?" said a cold, drawling voice.
Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right
behind him.
"Yeah, reckon so," said Harry casually.
"Got plenty of special features, hasn't it?" said Malfoy, eyes
glittering maliciously. "Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- in
case you get too near a dementor."
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
"Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy," said Harry. "Then
it could catch the Snitch for you."
The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and he
stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team,
who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry's
broom really was a Firebolt.
At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker
rooms. The weather couldn't have been more different from their match
against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze;
there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though
nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match
could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the
stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand
from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear
under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn't need it. He
wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.
"You know what we've got to do," said Wood as they prepared to leave
the
locker rooms. "If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just --
just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okay!"
They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw
team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field.
Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was
shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing,
nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as
the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight
lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to
do with nerves.
"Wood, Davies, shake hands," Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood
shook
hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.
"Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --"
Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster
than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting
around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which
was being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan.
"They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that
Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick,
the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at
this year's World Championship --"
"Jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the match?"
interrupted Professor McGonagall's voice.
"Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information
-- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --"
"Jordan!"
"Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading
for goal..."
Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a
glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She
was undoubtedly a very good flier -- she kept cutting across him,
forcing him to change direction.
"Show her your acceleration, Harry!" Fred yelled as he whooshed past in
pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.
Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal
posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first
goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw
it -- the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the
barriers.
Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him -- Harry was
speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was
ten feet away --
Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of
nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those
few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.
There was a great "Ooooooh" of disappointment from the Gryffindor
supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end.
George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger
directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in
midair to avoid it.
"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt
go! Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn --
Chang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precision- balance
is really noticeable in these long --"
"JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS?
GET ON WITH THE
COMMENTARY!"
Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put
Gryffindor only fifty points ahead -- if Cho got the Snitch before him,
Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a
Ravenclaw
Chaser, scanning the field frantically -- a glint of gold, a flutter of
tiny wings -- the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post --
Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead -- but just
then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him --
"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!" Wood roared
as Harry swerved
to avoid a collision. "KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE
TO!"
Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had
vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty
feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following
him.... She'd decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch
herself... All right, then... if she wanted to tail him, she'd have to
take the consequences....
He dived again, and Cho, thinking he'd seen the Snitch, tried to follow;
Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose
fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time -- the
Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.
He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on
the Snitch with every second -- then --
"Oh!" screamed Cho, pointing.
Distracted, Harry looked down.
Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at
him.
He didn't stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he
whipped out his wand and roared, "Expecto patronum!"
Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his
wand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause to
watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead -- he was
nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just
managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.
Madam Hooch's whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw
six
scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was
hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he
could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd.
"That's my boy!" Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all
kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his
head would come off In complete disarray, the team managed to make its
way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a
gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the
lead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.
"Yes!" Ron yelled, yanking Harry's arm into the air. "Yes! Yes!"
"Well done, Harry!" said Percy, looking delighted. "Ten Galleons to me!
Must find Penelope, excuse me --"
"Good for you, Harry!" roared Seamus Finnigan.
"Ruddy brilliant!" boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling
Gryffindors.
"That was quite some Patronus," said a voice in Harry's ear.
Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and
pleased.
"The dementors didn't affect me at all!" Harry said excitedly. "I didn't
feel a thing!"
"That would be because they -- er -- weren't dementors," said Professor
Lupin. "Come and see -- "
He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of
the field.
"You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright," said Lupin.
Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy,
Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all
struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It
looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle's shoulders.
Standing
over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was
Professor McGonagall.
"An unworthy trick!" she was shouting. "A low and cowardly attempt to
sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty
points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about
this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!"
If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor's victory, it was
this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry's side, doubled up
with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from
the robe, Goyle's head still stuck inside it.
"Come on, Harry!" said George, fighting his way over. "Party! Gryffindor
common room, now!"
"Right," said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the
rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the
stadium and back up to the castle.
It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went
on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared
for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of
butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.
"How did you do that?" squealed Angelina Johnson as George started
throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.
"With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs," Fred
muttered in Harry's ear.
Only one person wasn't joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly,
was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled
Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away from
the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles
and went over to her.
"Did you even come to the match?" he asked her.
"Of course I did," said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not
looking up. "And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well,
but I need to read this by Monday."
"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food," Harry said, looking
over
at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the
hatchet.
"I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to
read!" said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. "Anyway..." She
glanced over at Ron too. "He doesn't want me to join in."
There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly,
"If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those
Fudge Flies. He used to really like them --"
Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she
tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward
the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.
"Can't you give her a break?" Harry asked Ron quietly.
"No," said Ron flatly. "If she just acted like she was sorry -- but
she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like
Scabbers has gone on vacation or something."
The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in
her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist
that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their
dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed
into bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a
ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting
off to sleep....
He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his
Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery-white. It was
winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch
glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped
up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run,
and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out,
and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a
clearing and -
"AAARRGGHH! NOOO!"
Harry woke as suddenly as though he'd been hit in the face. Disoriented
in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hear
movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan's voice from the other side
of
the room: "What's going on?"
Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the
divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment,
Dean Thomas lit his lamp.
Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of
utmost terror on his face.
"Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!"
"What?"
"Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!"
"You sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?" said Dean.
"Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!"
They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first,
and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and
sleepy voices called after them.
"Who shouted?"
"What're you doing?"
The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered
with the debris from the party. It was deserted.
"Are you sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?"
"I'm telling you, I saw him!"
"What's all the noise?"
"Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!"
A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling or, dressing
gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing.
"Excellent, are we carrying on?" said Fred Weasley brightly.
"Everyone back upstairs!" said Percy, hurrying into the common room and
pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.
"Perce -- Sirius Black!" said Ron faintly. "In our dormitory! With a
knife! Woke me up!"
The common room went very still.
"Nonsense!" said Percy, looking startled. "You had too much to eat, Ron
-- had a nightmare --"
"I'm telling you --"
"Now, really, enough's enough!"
Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as
she entered the common room and stared furiously around.
"I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting
ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!"
"I certainly didn't authorize this, Professor!" said Percy, puffing
himself up indignantly. "I was just telling them all to get back to bed!
My brother Ron here had a nightmare --"
"IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE!" Ron yelled. "PROFESSOR, I WOKE
UP, AND SIRIUS
BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!"
Professor McGonagall stared at him.
"Don't be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through
the portrait hole?"
"Ask him!" said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir
Cadogan's picture. "Ask him if he saw --"
Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the Portrait
back open and went outside. The whole common room listened with bated
breath. "Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?"
"Certainly, good lady!" cried Sir Cadogan.
There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.
"You -- you did?" said Professor McGonagall. "But -- but the password!"
"He had 'em!" said Sir Cadogan proudly. "Had the whole week's, my lady!
Read 'em off a little piece of paper!"
Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to
face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk.
"Which person," she said, her voice shaking, "which abysmally foolish
person wrote down this week's passwords and left them lying around?"
There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks.
Neville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raised
his hand slowly into the air.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
SNAPE'S GRUDGE
No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle
was being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the
common
room, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor
McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.
Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter
security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to
recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling
up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in
the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had
been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat
Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely
nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she
was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been
hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking
in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.
Harry couldn't help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on
the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred
and George had been right in thinking that they -- and now Harry, Ron,
and Hermione -- were the only ones who knew about the hidden
passageway
within it.
"D'you reckon we should tell someone?" Harry asked Ron.
"We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's," said Ron
dismissively.
"We'd've heard if the shop had been broken into."
Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up
too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again.
Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life,
people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear
that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely
shaken by the night's events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what
had happened, with a wealth of detail.
"... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was
in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft... I woke up and
one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down.... I rolled
over... and I saw him standing over me... like a skeleton, with loads of
filthy hair ... holding this great long knife, must've been twelve
inches... and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled,
and he scampered.
"Why, though?" Ron added to Harry as the group of secondyear girls who
had been listening to his chilling tale departed. "Why did he run?"
Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the
wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved
twelve years ago that he didn't mind murdering innocent people, and this
time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.
"He must've known he'd have a job getting back out of the castle once
you'd yelled and woken people up," said Harry thoughtfully. "He'd've had
to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole... then he
would' ve met the teachers...."
Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with
him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a
detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower.
Poor Neville was forced to wait. outside the common room every night for
somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at
him. None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one
his grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black's break-in,
she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive
over breakfast -- a Howler.
The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual,
and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet
envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite
him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once -- Ron had got one from
his mother the year before.
"Run for it, Neville," Ron advised.
Neville didn't need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding
it before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin
table exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howler
go off in the entrance hall -- Neville's grandmother's voice, magically
magnified to a hundred times its Usual volume, shrieking about how he
had brought shame on the whole family.
Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that
he had a letter too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on
the wrist.
"Ouch! Oh -- thanks, Hedwig."
Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of
Neville's cornflakes. The note inside said:
Dear Harry and Ron, How Abut having tea with me this afternoon 'round
six? I'll come collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE
ENTRANCE
HALL; YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers,
Hagrid
"He probably wants to hear all about Black!" said Ron.
So at six o'clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower,
passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance
hall.
Hagrid was already waiting for them.
"All right, Hagrid!" said Ron. "S'pose you want to hear about Saturday
night, do you?"
"I've already heard all abou' it," said Hagrid, opening the front doors
and leading them outside.
"Oh," said Ron, looking slightly put out.
The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid's cabin was Buckbeak, who
was stretched out on top of Hagrid's patchwork quilt, his enormous wings
folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets.
Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic,
hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from
the top of Hagrid's wardrobe door.
"What are they for, Hagrid?" said Harry.
"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous
Creatures," said Hagrid. "This Friday. Him an' me'll be goin' down ter
London together. I've booked two beds on the Knight Bus...."
Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that
Buckbeak's trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron's
face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping
him prepare Buckbeak's defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven
it clean out of their minds.
Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they
knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with
Hagrid's cooking.
I got somethin' ter discuss with you two," said Hagrid, sitting himself
between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.
"What?" said Harry.
"Hermione," said Hagrid.
"What about her?" said Ron.
"She's in a righ' state, that's what. She's bin comin' down ter visit me
a lot since Chris'mas. Bin feelin' lonely. Firs' yeh weren' talking to
her because o' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her because her cat
--"
"-- ate Scabbers!" Ron interjected angrily.
"Because her cat acted like all cats do," Hagrid continued doggedly.
"She's cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin' through a rough time at
the moment. Bitten off more'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work
she's tryin' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak's case,
mind.... She's found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he'll stand
a good chance now..."
"Hagrid, we should've helped as well -- sorry --" Harry began awkwardly.
"I'm not blamin' yeh!" said Hagrid, waving Harry's apology aside. "Gawd
knows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with. I've seen yeh practicin'
Quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, I
thought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats. Tha's
all."
Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.
"Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She's got
her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an' you two not talkin' to
her --"
"If she'd just get rid of that cat, I'd speak to her again!" Ron said
angrily. "But she's still sticking up for it! It's a maniac, and she
won't hear a word against it!"
"Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets," said Hagrid
wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid's
pillow.
They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor's improved
chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o'clock, Hagrid walked them back
up to the castle.
A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they
returned to the common room.
"Hogsmeade, next weekend!" said Ron, craning over the heads to read the
new notice. "What d'you reckon?" he added quietly to Harry as they went
to sit down.
"Well, Filch hasn't done anything about the passage into Honeydukes...."
Harry said, even more quietly.
"Harry!" said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around
at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing
a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.
"Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall
about that map!" said Hermione.
"Can you hear someone talking, Harry?" growled Ron, not looking at
Hermione.
"Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly
did to you! I mean it, I'll tell --"
"So now you're trying to get Harry expelled!" said Ron furiously.
"Haven't you done enough damage this year?"
Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks
leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression
on Ron's face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the
girls' dormitories.
"So how about it?" Ron said to Harry as though there had been no
interruption. "Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. You
haven't even been inside Zonko's yet!"
Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.
"Okay," he said. "But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time."
On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag,
slipped the Marauder's Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast
with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the
table at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him
walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody
else proceeded to the front doors.
"'Bye!" Harry called to Ron. "See you when you get back!"
Ron grinned and winked.
Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder's Map out of
his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed
it out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it.
The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.
Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, "Dissendium!" and shoved
his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville
came around the corner.
"Harry! I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either!"
"Hi, Neville," said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and
pushing the map back into his pocket. "What are you up to?"
"Nothing," shrugged Neville. "Want a game of Exploding Snap?"
"Er -- not now -- I was going to go to the library and do that vampire
essay for Lupin --"
"I'll come with you!" said Neville brightly. I haven't done it either!"
"Er -- hang on -- yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!"
"Great, you can help me!" said Neville, his round face anxious. "I don't
understand that thing about the garlic at all -- do they have to eat it,
or --"
He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry's shoulder.
It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.
"And what are you two doing here?" said Snape, coming to a halt and
looking from one to the other. "An odd place to meet --"
To Harry's immense disquiet, Snape's black eyes flicked to the doorways
on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.
"We're not -- meeting here," said Harry. "We just -- met here."
"Indeed?" said Snape. "You have a habit of turning up in unexpected
places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason.... I
suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong."
Harry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the
corner, Harry looked back. Snape was running one of his hands over the
one-eyed witch's head, examining it closely.
Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the
password, then pretending he'd left his vampire essay in the library and
doubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled out
the map again and held it close to his nose.
The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map
carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled
Severus Snape was now back in its office.
He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himself
inside, and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute.
He wiped the Marauder's Map blank again, then set off at a run.
Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into
the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back.
It's me," he muttered.
"What kept you?" Ron hissed.
"Snape was hanging around."
They set off up the High Street.
"Where are you?" Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth. "Are
you still there? This feels weird...."
They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of
an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The
owls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them;
from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls ("Local Deliveries
Only"), which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry's
hand.
Then they visited Zonko's, which was so packed with students Harry had
to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There
were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred's and George's wildest
dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from
under the cloak. They left Zonko's with their money bags considerably
lighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging with
Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup
apiece.
The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying
indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope
to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It
stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight
was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown
garden.
"Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it," said Ron as they leaned on the
fence, looking up at it. "I asked Nearly Headless Nick... he says he's
heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George
tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut...."
Harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the
cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone was
climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments
later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle.
Malfoy
was speaking.
"... should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the
hearing to tell them about my arm... about how I couldn't use it for
three months...."
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
"I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend
himself... 'There's no 'arm in 'im, 'onest that hippogriff's as good as
dead --"
Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent
grin.
"What are you doing, Weasley?"
Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.
"Suppose You'd love to live here, wouldn't you, Weasley? Dreaming about
having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room -- is
that true?"
Harry seized the back of Ron's robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy.
"Leave him to me," he hissed in Ron's ear.
The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around
behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large
handful
of mud out of the path.
"We were just discussing your friend Hagrid," Malfoy said to Ron. "Just
trying to imagine what he's saying to the Committee for the Disposal of
Dangerous Creatures. D'you think he'll cry when they cut off his
hippogriff's
SPLAT.
Malfoy's head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silverblond hair
was suddenly dripping in muck.
"What the --?"
Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing
so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring
wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.
"What was that? 'Who did that?"
"Very haunted up here, isn't it?" said Ron, with the air of one
commenting on the weather.
Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no
use
against ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted
landscape.
Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded
some foul-smelling, green sludge.
SPLATTER.
Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furiously on the
spot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes.
"It came from over there!" said Malfoy, wiping his face, and staring at
a spot some six feet to the left of Harry.
Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie.
Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe's
back. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of
pirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the
only person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry
stuck out his leg. Crabbe stumbled -- and his huge, flat foot caught the
hem of Harry's cloak. Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off
his face.
For a split second, Malfoy stared at him.
"AAARGH!" he yelled, pointing at Harry's head. Then he turned tail and
ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind
him.
Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done.
"Harry!" Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point
where Harry had disappeared, "you'd better run for it! If Malfoy tells
anyone -- you'd better get back to the castle, quick --" "See you
later," said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the path
toward Hogsmeade.
Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believe
Malfoy? Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak -- nobody except
Dumbledore. Harry's stomach turned over -- Dumbledore would know
exactly
what had happened, if Malfoy said any- thing --
Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone
floor, through the trapdoor -- Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it
under his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage.... Malfoy would get
back first... how long would it take him to find a teacher? Panting, a
sharp pain in his side, Harry didn't slow down until he reached the
stone slide. He would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too
much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher -- he hid it
in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweaty
hands slipping on the sides of the chute. He reached the inside of the
witch's hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, and
hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from
behind the statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching.
It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black robes
swishing, then stopped in front of him.
"So," he said.
There was a look of surpressed triumph about him. Harry tried to look
innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he
quickly hid in his pockets.
"Come with me, Potter," said Snape.
Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the
inside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs
to the dungeons and then into Snape's office.
Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious
trouble then too. Snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in
jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting
in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.
"Sit," said Snape.
Harry sat. Snape, however, remained, standing.
"Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter," said
Snape.
Harry didn't say anything.
"He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into
Weasley -- apparently alone."
Still, Harry didn't speak.
"Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large
amount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think that
could have happened?"
Harry tried to look mildly surprised.
"I don't know, Professor."
Snape's eyes were boring into Harry's. It was exactly like trying to
stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.
"Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what
it might have been, Potter?"
"No," said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.
"It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair."
There was a long silence.
"Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey," said Harry. "If he's seeing
things like --"
"What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?" said
Snape
softly. "Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has
permission to be in Hogsmeade."
"I know that," said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or
fear. "It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --"
"Malfoy is not having hallucinations," snarled Snape, and he bent down,
a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a foot
apart. "If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you."
"I've been up in Gryffindor Tower," said Harry. "Like you told --" "Can
anyone confirm that?"
Harry didn't say anything. Snape's thin mouth curled into a horrible
smile.
"So," he said, straightening up again. "Everyone from the Minister of
Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from
Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let the
ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where
he wants to, with no thought for the consequences.
Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the
truth. He wasn't going to do it. Snape had no proof -- yet.
"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter," Snape said
suddenly, his eyes glinting. "He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small
amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut
above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends
and admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny."
"My dad didn't strut," said Harry, before he could stop himself. "And
neither do I."
"Your father didn't set much store by rules either," Snape went on,
pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. "Rules were for
lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen --"
"SHUT UP!"
Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his
last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn't care that
Snape's face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.
"What did you say to me, Potter?"
"I told you to shut up about my dad!" Harry yelled. I know the truth,
all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn't even be
here if it wasn't for my dad!"
Snape's sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.
"And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father
saved my life?" he whispered. "Or did he consider the details too
unpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears?"
Harry bit his lip. He didn't know what had happened and didn't want to
admit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.
I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father,
Potter," he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. "Have you been
imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you -- your
saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that
would have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet at
the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was
saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would
have been expelled from Hogwarts."
Snape's uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.
"Turn out your pockets, Potter!" he spat suddenly.
Harry didn't move. There was a pounding in his ears.
"Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them
out, Potter!"
Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko's tricks and
the Marauder's Map.
Snap picked up the Zonko's bag.
"Ron gave them to me," said Harry, praying he'd get a chance to tip Ron
off before Snape saw him. "He -brought them back from Hogsmeade last
time --"
"Indeed? And you've been carrying them around ever since? How very
touching... and what is this?"
Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his
face impassive.
"Spare bit of parchment," he said with a shrug.
Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.
"Surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment?" he said.
"Why don't I just -- throw this away?"
His hand moved toward the fire.
"No!" Harry said quickly.
"So!" said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. "Is this another
treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it -- something else? A letter,
perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or -- instructions to get into
Hogsmeade without passing the dementors?"
Harry blinked. Snape's eyes gleamed.
"Let me see, let me see...." he muttered, taking out his wand and
smoothing the map out on his desk. "Reveal your secret!" he said,
touching the wand to the parchment.
Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.
"Show yourself!" Snape said, tapping the map sharply.
It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.
"Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield
the information you conceal!" Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.
As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the
smooth surface of the map.
Mooney presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to
keep
his abnormally large nose out of other people's business."
Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map
didn't stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.
"Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony and would like to add that Professor
Snape is an ugle git."
It would have been very funny if the situation hadn't been so serious.
And there was more....
"Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like
that ever became a professor."
Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he'd opened them, the map had had
its last word.
"Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash
his
hair , the slimeball."
Harry waited for the blow to fall.
"So..." said Snape softly. "We'll see about this...."
He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from
a jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.
"Lupin!" Snape called into the fire. "I want a word!"
Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared
in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was
clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.
"You called, Severus?" said Lupin mildly.
"I certainly did," said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode
back to his desk. "I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was
carrying this."
Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony,
Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed
expression appeared on Lupin's face.
"Well?" said Snape.
Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin
was doing some very quick thinking.
"Well?" said Snape again. "This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic.
This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you
imagine Potter got such a thing?"
Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry's direction,
warned him not to interrupt.
"Full of Dark Magic?" he repeated mildly. "Do you really think so,
Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that
insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I
imagine Harry got it from a joke shop --"
"Indeed?" said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. "You think a
joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don't think it more
likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?"
Harry didn't understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently,
did Lupin.
"You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?" he said. "Harry, do
you know any of these men?"
"No," said Harry quickly.
"You see, Severus?" said Lupin, turning back to Snape. "It looks like a
Zonko product to me --"
Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out
of breath, and stopped just short of Snape's desk, clutching the stitch
in his chest and trying to speak.
"I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff," he choked. "Bought -- it... in
Zonko's... ages -- ago..."
"Well!" said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around
cheerfully. "That seems to clear that up! Severus, I'll take this back,
shall I?" He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. "Harry, Ron,
come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay -- excuse us,
Severus
--"
Harry didn't dare look at Snape as they left his office. He. Ron, and
Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking.
Then Harry turned to Lupin.
"Professor, I --"
"I don't want to hear explanations," said Lupin shortly. He glanced
around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. "I happen to know
that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know
it' s a map," he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. "I don't want to
know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you
didn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a
student left information about the castle lying around. And I can't let
you have it back, Harry."
Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.
"Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers?"
"Because...," Lupin hesitated, "because these mapmakers would have
wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremely
entertaining."
"Do you know them?" said Harry, impressed.
"We've met," he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously
than ever before.
"Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you
take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have
heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an
effect
on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor
way to repay them -- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic
tricks."
He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any
point in Snape's office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble
staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the
Invisibility Cloak -- it was still down there, but he didn't dare go and
get it.
"It's my fault," said Ron abruptly. "I persuaded you to go. Lupin's
right, it was stupid, we shouldn't've done it --"
He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were
pacing, and Hermione was walking toward them. One look at her face
convinced Harry that she had heard what had happened. His heart
plummeted -- had she told Professor McGonagall?
"Come to have a good gloat?" said Ron savagely as she stopped in front
of them. "Or have you just been to tell on us?"
"No," said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip
was trembling. "I just thought you ought to know... Hagrid lost his
case. Buckbeak is going to be executed."
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL
He sent me this," Hermione said, holding out the letter.
Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had
smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read.
Dear Hermione, We lost. I'm allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.
Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won't forget all
the help you gave us.
Hagrid
"They can't do this," said Harry. "They can't. Buckbeak isn't
dangerous."
"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it," said Hermione, wiping
her eyes. "You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery old
fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always
is. Only I can't see any hope.... Nothing will have changed."
"Yeah, it will," said Ron fiercely. "You won't have to do all the work
alone this time, Hermione. I'll help."
"Oh, Ron!"
Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely.
Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of
the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.
"Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers..." she sobbed.
"Oh -- well -- he was old," said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that
she had let go of him. "And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum
and Dad might get me an owl now."
The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second
break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit
Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was during
Care of Magical Creatures lessons.
He seemed numb with shock at the verdict.
"S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in
black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them dates
yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' said
his bit, and the Committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em...."
"There's still the appeal!" said Ron fiercely. "Don't give up Yet, we're
working on it!"
They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class.
Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle,
and
kept looking back, laughing derisively.
"S'no good, Ron," said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps.
"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make sure
the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. I owe him
that...."
Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried
in his handkerchief.
"Look at him blubber!"
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle
doors, listening.
"Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?" said Malfoy. "And he's
supposed to be our teacher!"
Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione
got
there first -- SMACK!
She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could
muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood
flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.
"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul -- you evil --"
"Hermione!" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung
it back.
"Get off, Ron!"
Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and
Goyle
looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.
"C'mon," Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had
disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons.
"Hermione!" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and irnpressed.
"Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!" Hermione said
shrilly. "You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin
wins!"
"We're due in Charms," said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. "We'd
better go."
They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's
classroom.
"You're late, boys!" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened
the classroom door. "Come along, quickly, wands out, we're
experimenting
with Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs --"
Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron
looked behind him.
"Where's Hermione gone?"
Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet
Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door.
"That's weird," said Harry, staring at Ron. "Maybe -- maybe she went to
the bathroom or something?"
But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson.
"She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too," said Ron as the
class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had
left them with a feeling of great contentment.
Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their
apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off,
and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.
"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?" Ron said anxiously as
they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.
They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password
("Flibbertigibbet"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the
common room.
Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an
open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry
prodded her awake.
"Wh -- what?" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly
around. "Is it time to go? W -- which lesson have we got now?"
"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes," said Harry.
"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?"
"What? Oh no!" Hermione squeaked. "I forgot to go to Charms!"
"But how could you forget?" said Harry. "You were with us till we were
right outside the classroom!"
"I don't believe it!" Hermione wailed. "Was Professor Flitwick angry?
Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!"
"You know what, Hermione?" said Ron, looking down at the enormous
Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. "I reckon you're
cracking up. You're trying to do too much."
"No, I'm not!" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and
staring hopelessly around for her bag. "I just made a mistake, that's
all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... I'll see
you in Divination!"
Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawneys
classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed.
"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our
exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!"
Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room.
Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white
mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety
table.
"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term," Ron
muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she
was lurking nearby.
"Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry," Harry muttered
back. "I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my
hands."
"Good day to you!" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor
Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati
and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow
of their crystal ball.
"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I
had planned," said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the
fire and gazing around. "The fates have informed me that your
examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you
sufficient practice."
Hermione snorted.
"Well, honestly... 'the fates have informed her' who sets the exam? She
does! What an amazing prediction!" she said, not troubling to keep her
voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.
It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her
face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had
not.
"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art," she said dreamily. "I do
not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite
depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and
external eyes" -- Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff
his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise -- "so as to clear the Inner
Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will
see before the end of the class."
And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring
blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts
such as "this is stupid" kept drifting across it. It didn't help that
Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.
"Seen anything yet?" Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour's quiet
crystal gazing.
"Yeah, there's a burn on this table," said Ron, pointing. "Someone's
spilled their candle."
"This is such a waste of time," Hermione hissed. "I could be practicing
something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms --"
Professor Trelawney rustled past.
"Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within
their Orb?" she murmured over the clinking of her bangles.
I don't need help," Ron whispered. "It's obvious what this means.
There's going to be loads of fog tonight."
Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.
"Now, really!" said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in
their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. "You are
disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!" She approached their table and
peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was
sure he knew what was coming --
"There is something here!" Professor Trelawney whispered, lowerng her
face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses.
"Something moving... but what is it?"
Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, Including his Firebolt,
that it wasn't good news, whatever it was. And sure enough --
"My dear Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. "It is here,
plainer than ever before... my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever
closer... the Gr --"
"Oh, for goodness' sake!" said Hermione loudly. "Not that ridiculous
Grim again!"
Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione's face. Parvati
whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too.
Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable
anger.
"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class
my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of
Divination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a student
whose mind was so hopelessly mundane."
There was a moment's silence. Then --
"Fine!" said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the
Future back into her bag. "Fine!" she repeated, swinging the bag over
her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. "I give up! I'm
leaving!"
And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the
trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight.
It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor
Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned
abruptly from Harry and Ron's table, breathing rather heavily as she
tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.
"Ooooo!" said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. "Ooooo,
Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn't
you? Didn't you, Professor? 'Around Easter, one of our number will leave
us forever!' You said it ages ago, Professor!"
Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile.
"Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us.
One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs.... The Inner
Eye can be a burden, you know..."
Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that
Professor Trelawney could join their table instead.
"Some day Hermione's having, eh?" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed.
"Yeah..."
Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white
mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he?
The
last thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch
final drawing ever nearer.
The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never
had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous
collapse, and he wasn't the only one.
"Call this a holiday!" Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one
afternoon. "The exams are ages away, what're they playing at?"
But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she
was taking more subjects than anybody else. She was usually last to
leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the next
morning; she had shadows like Lupin's under her eyes, and seemed
constantly close to tears.
Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal. When he wasn't
doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with
names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A
Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be
horrible to Crookshanks.
Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice
every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The
Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after
the Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two
hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that
they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It
also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because
capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.
"So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up," Wood
told Harry constantly. "Only if we're more than fifty points up, Harry,
or we win the match but lose the Cup. You've got that, Haven't you? You
must catch the Snitch only if we're --"
"I KNOW, OLIVER!" Harry yelled.
The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match.
Gryffindor hadn't won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie
Weasley (Ron's second oldest brother) had been seeker. But Harry
doubted
whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The
enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy
was still smarting ,bout the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was
even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of
punishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him in
the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made
him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.
Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly
charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between
the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of
small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty
incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year
ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.
Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn't walk to
class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him
up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching
away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people.
Wood
had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he
went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole
of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it
was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was
surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his
Firebolt's safety than his own. When he wasn't flying it, he locked it
securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower
at break times to check that it was still there.
All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the
night before the match. Even Hermione had Put down her books.
"I can't work, I can't concentrate," she said nervously.
There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing
with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver
Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner,
prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred's and George's jokes.
Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of
things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he
did, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was
fighting to get out of his stomach.
"You're going to be fine," Hermione told him, though she looked
positively terrified.
"You've got a Firebolt!" said Ron.
"Yeah..." said Harry, his stomach writhing.
It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, "Team!
Bed!"
Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood
was yelling, "Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!" Then he
dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the
match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid
a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realized he had
forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start.
It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken
place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team
definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very
thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to
pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window.
The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the
treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless
and
innocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would
be perfect.
Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when
something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across
the
silvery lawn.
Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them
on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn't be the Grim -- not now
-- not right before the match -
He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute's frantic
searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now... It
wasn't the Grim at all ... it was a cat.... Harry clutched the window
ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only
Crookshanks....
Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat
against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was
sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.
And just then, it emerged -- a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving
stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry
stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well,
how could it be an omen of Harry's death?
"Ron!" Harry hissed. "Ron! Wake up!"
"Huh?"
I need you to tell me if you can see something!"
"S'all dark, Harry," Ron muttered thickly. "What're you or, about?"
"Down here --"
Harry looked quickly back out of the window.
Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the
windowsill
to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren't
there. Where had they gone?
A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.
Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the
next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn't help grinning broadly as
he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding
them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry
noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual.
Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching
nothing himself Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else
had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left
the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.
"Good luck, Harry!" called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing.
"Okay -- no wind to speak of -- sun's a bit bright, that could impair
your vision, watch out for it -- ground's fairly hard, good, that'll
give us a fast kickoff --"
Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally,
they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest
of the school spilling onto the lawn.
"Locker rooms," said Wood tersely.
None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry
wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he'd eaten
something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time
at all, Wood was saying, "Okay, it's time, let's go --"
They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Threequarters
of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the
Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like "GO
GRYFFINDOR!" and "LIONS FOR THE CUK' Behind the Slytherin goal
posts,
however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of
Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very
front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.
"And here are the Gryffindors!" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as
commentator as usual. "Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley,
and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a
good few years --"
Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of "boos" from the Slytherin end.
"And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He's Made some
changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill
--"
More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a
point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person On the Slytherin team; the
rest of them were enormous.
"Captains, shake hands!" said Madam Hooch.
Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand very
tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other's
fingers.
"Mount your brooms!" said Madam Hooch. "Three... two... one..."
The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen
brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead;
his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw
Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.
"And it's Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinner of Gryffindor with
the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking
good, Alicia! Argh, no -- Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington
of Slytherin tearing UP the field -- WHAM! -- nice Bludger work there by
George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it's caught by -- Johnson,
Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina -- nice swerve around
Montague -- duck, Angelina, that's a Bludger!- SHE SCORES! TENZERO TO
GRYFFINDOR!"
Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the
sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight
"OUCH!"
Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went
smashing
into her.
"Sorry!" said Flint as the crowd below booed. "Sorry, didn't see her!"
A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater's club at the back of
Flint's head. Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his broom and
began to bleed.
"That will do!" shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between then. "Penalty
shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty
shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!"
"Come off it, Miss!" howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle
and
Alicia flew forward to take the penalty.
"Come on, Alicia!" yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the
crowd. "YES! SHE'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO
GRYFFINDOR!"
Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely,
fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of
the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched.
"'Course, Wood's a superb Keeper!" Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint
waited for Madam Hooch's whistle. "Superb! Very difficult to pass --
very difficult indeed -- YES! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! HE'S SAVED IT!"
Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still
making sure he caught every word of Lee's commentary. It was essential
that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty
points up --
"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession -- no!
Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for
Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she's streaking up the field -- THAT WAS
DELIBERATE!"
Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead
of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cart wheeled in the
air, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle.
Madam Hooch's whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague
and
began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty
past the Slytherin Seeker.
"THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING --"
"Jordan, if you can't commentate in an unbiased way --"
"I'm telling it like it is, Professor!"
Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch it was
shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts -- but he
mustn't catch it yet -- and if Malfoy saw it -
Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt around
and sped off toward the Slytherin end -- it worked. Malfoy went haring
after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there....
WHOOSH.
One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear, hit by the
gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again
WHOOSH.
The second Bludger grazed Harry's elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was
closing in.
Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him,
clubs raised --
He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick
collided with a sickening crunch.
"Ha haaa!" yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from
each other, clutching their heads. "Too bad, boys! You'll need to get up
earlier than that to beat a Firebold And it's Gryffindor in possession
again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle -- Flint alongside her -- poke him
in the eye, Angelina! -- it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke -- oh
no -- Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal
posts, come on now, Wood, save --!"
But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin
end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the
magical megaphone away from him.
"Sorry, Professor, sorry! WoiA happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead,
thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession --"
it was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged
that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were
rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with
his club and tried to say he'd thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley
elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams
penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the
score forty-ten to Gryffindor.
The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to
Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it once Gryffindor
was fifty points ahead -
Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around
her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of
revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absence
to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after
the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom,
completely winded.
Madam Hooch was beside herself
"YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS
WITHIN THE SCORING
AREA!" she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. "Gryffindor penalty!"
And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a
Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle Out of his hands; Alicia
seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal -- seventy-ten.
The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse -- Gryffindor
was
sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup
was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he
soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy
speeding along behind him.
And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him.
Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he
stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down --
Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed
hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back.
"You --"
Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn't reach -- Malfoy was
panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were
sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he'd wanted to do -- the
Snitch had disappeared again.
"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I've never seen such tactics." Madam
Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his
Nimbus Two Thousand and One.
"YOU CHEATING SCUM!" Lee Jordan was howling into the
megaphone, dancing
out of Professor McGonagall's reach. "YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B --"
Pprofessor McGonagall didn't even bother to tell him off She was
actually shaking her finger in Malfoys direction, her hat had fallen
off, and she too was shouting furiously.
Alicia took Gryffindor's penalty, but she was so angry she missed by
several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the
Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy's foul on Harry, were being spurred on
to greater heights.
"Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal -- Montague scores
--" Lee groaned. "Seventy- twenty to Gryffindor..."
Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each
other. Harry wasn't going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch....
"Get out of it, Potter!" Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to
turn and found Harry blocking him.
"Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina,
COME ON!"
Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was
streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper
-- they were all going to block her --
Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along
the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the
Slytherins.
"AAAAAAARRRGH!"
They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina's Way was
clear.
"SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to
twenty!"
Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt
in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.
And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was
diving, a look of triumph on his face -- there, a few feet above the
grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer -
Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead -
"Go! Go! Go!" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfay -- Harry
flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him --
he was at Malfoy's ankles -- he was level --
Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked
Malfoy's arm out of the way and --
"YES!"
He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium
exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The
tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings
hopelessly against his fingers.
Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized
Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry
felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina's,
Alicia's, and Katie's voices, "We've won the Cup! We've won the Cup!"
Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling
hoarsely, back to earth.
Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto
the field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused
impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and the rest
of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into
the light, he saw Hagrid, Plastered with crimson rosettes -- "Yeh beat
'em, Harry, yeh beat 'em!
Wait till I tell Buckbeak!" There was Percy, jumping up and down like a
maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder
even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and
there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words
failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands,
where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.
If only there had been a dementor around.... As a sobbing Wood passed
Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have
produced the world's best Patronus.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY'S PREDICTION
Harry's euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a
week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the
days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was
strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several
pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones
or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of
the lake.
But they couldn't. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing
around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle,
trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of
summer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George
Weasley
had been spotted working; they were about to take their O.W.L.s
(Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his
N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highest
qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of
Magic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and
gave
very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the
common
room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious
than Percy was Hermione.
Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend
several classes at once, but they couldn't restrain themselves when they
saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first column
read:
Monday
9 o'clock, Arithmancy
9 o'clock, Transfiguration
Lunch
1 o'clock, Charms
1 o'clock, Ancient Runes
"Hermione?" Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when
interrupted these days. "Er -- are you sure you've copied down these
times right?"
"What?" snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining
it.
"Yes, of course I have."
"Is there any point asking how you're going to sit for two exams at
once?" said Harry.
"No," said Hermione shortly. "Have either of you seen my copy of
Numerology and Gramatica?"
"Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading," said Ron, but
very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment Harry, Ron,
and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.
"Beaky's gettin' a bit depressed," Hagrid told them, bending low on the
pretense of checking that Harry's flobberworm was still alive. "Bin
cooped up too long. But still... we'll know day after tomorrow -- one
way or the other --"
They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try
as Harry might, he couldn't get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and
Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled
something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before
moving away.
Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of
Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything
Florean
Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he
could have had one of Fortescue's choco-nut sundaes with him in the
stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the
greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once
more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day,
when it would all be over.
Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the
Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of
them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where
they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow,
cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a
patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk,
then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart.
"Excellent, Harry," Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk,
grinning. "Full marks."
Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione.
Ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfully
confused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did
everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it.
After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.
"Hermione!" said Lupin, startled. "What's the matter?"
"P -- P -- Professor McGonagall!" Hermione gasped, pointing into the
trunk. "Sh -- she said I'd failed everything!"
It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had
regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle.
Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's boggart, but an
argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.
Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing
there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.
"Hello there, Harry!" he said. "Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly
finished?"
"Yes," said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with
the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.
"Lovely day," said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.
"Pity... pity..."
He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.
"I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a
mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black
situation, I was asked to step in."
"Does that mean the appeal's already happened?" Ron interrupted,
stepping forward.
"No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon," said Fudge, looking
curiously at Ron.
"Then you might not have to witness an execution at A!" said Eon
stoutly. "The hippogriff might get off!"
Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors
behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their
very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache.
Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted
toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, "Dear, dear, I'm
getting too old for this.... Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge?"
The black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry
looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a
shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione
nudged
him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.
"Why'd you stop me?" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for
lunch. "Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn't
justice!"
"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like
that to his boss!" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. "As
long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly,
they can't possibly execute Buckbeak...."
But Harry could tell Hermione didn't really believe what she was saying.
All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch,
happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry,
Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't join
in.
Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination; Hermione's, Muggle Studies.
They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the
first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh,
where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to
Professor Trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute
studying.
"She's seeing us all separately," Neville informed them as they went to
sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on
his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. "Have either of you ever
seen anything in a crystal ball?" he asked them unhappily.
"Nope," said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry.
knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started.
The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each
person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class
hissed, "What did she ask? Was it okay?"
But they all refused to say.
"She says the crystal ball's told her that if I tell you, I'll have a
horrible accident!" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the
ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.
"That's convenient," snorted Ron. "You know, I'm starting to think
Hermione was right about her" -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor
overhead -- "she's a right old fraud."
"Yeah," said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o'clock.
"Wish she'd hurry up..."
Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.
"She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer," she informed Harry
and Ron. "I saw loads of stuff... Well, good luck!"
She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.
"Ronald Weasley," said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads.
Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry
was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the
floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the
sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.
Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the
ladder.
"How'd it go?" Harry asked him, standing up.
"Rubbish," said Ron. "Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up.
Don't think she was convinced, though...."
"Meet you in the common room," Harry muttered as Professor
Trelawney's
voice called, "Harry Potter!"
The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed,
the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he
stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor
Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.
"Good day, my dear," she said softly. "If you would kindly gaze into the
Orb.... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it...."
Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could,
willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but
nothing happened.
"Well?" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. "What do you see?"
The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the
perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what
Ron
had just said, and decided to pretend.
"Er --" said Harry, "a dark shape... um..."
"What does it resemble?" whispered Professor Trelawney. "Think, now..."
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
"A hippogriff," he said firmly.
"Indeed!" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the
parchment perched upon her knees. "My boy, you may well be seeing the
outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look
closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?"
"Yes," said Harry firmly.
"Are you sure?" Professor Trelawney urged him. "Are you quite sure,
dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy
figure raising an axe behind it?"
"No!" said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.
"No blood? No weeping Hagrid?"
"No!" said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the
heat. "It looks fine, it's - - flying away..."
Professor Trelawney sighed.
"Well, dear, I think we'll leave it there.... A little disappointing...
but I'm sure you did your best."
Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a
loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.
"IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT."
Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her
armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging.
"S -- sorry?" said Harry.
But Professor Trelawney didn't seem to hear him. Her eyes started to
roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she was about to
have some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the
hospital wing -- and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same
harsh voice, quite unlike her own:
"THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED
BY HIS FOLLOWERS.
HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS.
TONIGHT, BEFORE
MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT
TO REJOIN HIS
MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS
SERVANTS AID, GREATER AND
MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT... BEFORE
MIDNIGHT... THE
SERVANT... WILL SET OU... TO REJOIN... HIS MASTER....
Professor Trelawney's head fell forward onto her chest. She made a
grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite
suddenly, Professor Trelawney's head snapped up again.
"I'm so sorry, dear boy," she said dreamily, "the heat of the day, you
know... I drifted off for a moment...."
Harry sat there, staring at her.
"Is there anything wrong, my dear?"
"You -- you just told me that the -- the Dark Lord's going to rise
again... that his servant's going to go back to him.
Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.
"The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that's
hardly
something to joke about.... Rise again, indeed --"
,'But you just said it! You. said the Dark Lord --"
"I think you must have dozed off too, dear!" said Professor Trelawney.
"I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched
as that!"
Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase,
wondering... had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real
prediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test?
Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the
entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney's words still
resounding in his head. People were striding past him in the opposite
direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of
long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and
entered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner,
however, sat Ron and Hermione.
"Professor Trelawney," Harry panted, "just told me --"
But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.
"Buckbeak lost," said Ron weakly. "Hagrid's just sent this."
Hagrid's note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his
hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly
legible.
Lost appeal. They're going to execute at sunset. Nothing you can do.
Don't come down. I don't want you to see it.
Hagrid
"We've got to go," said Harry at once. "He can't just sit there on his
own, waiting for the executioner!"
"Sunset, though," said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed
sort of way. "We'd never be allowed... 'specially you, Harry...."
Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking.
"If we only had the Invisibility Cloak...."
"Where is it?" said Hermione.
Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed
witch.
"... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I'm in serious
trouble," he finished.
"That's true," said Hermione, getting to her feet. "If he sees you....
How do you open the witch's hump again?"
"You -- you tap it and say, 'Dissendium,'" said Harry. "But --"
Hermione didn't wait for the rest of his sentence; she strode across the
room, pushed open the Fat Lady's portrait and vanished from sight.
"She hasn't gone to get it?" Ron said, staring after her.
She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery
cloak folded carefully under her robes.
"Hermione, I don't know what's gotten, into you lately!" said Ron,
astounded. "First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor
Trelawney --"
Hermione looked rather flattered.
They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to
Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of
his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They skulked
in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were
sure it was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying across
the hall and a door slamming. Hermione poked her head around the door.
"Okay," she whispered, "no one there -- cloak on --"
Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed
the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front
steps into the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden
Forest, gilding the top branches of the trees.
They reached Hagrid's cabin and knocked. He was a minute in answering,
and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced and
trembling.
"It's us," Harry hissed. "We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us
in and we can take it off."
"Yeh shouldn've come!" Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they
stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the
cloak.
Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He
looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This
helplessness was worse to watch than tears.
"Wan' some tea?" he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for
the kettle.
"Where's Buckbeak, Hagrid?" said Hermione hesitantly.
I -- I took him outside," said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table
as he filled up the jug. "He's tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought he
oughta see the trees an' -- an' smell fresh air -- before
Hagrid's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his
grasp and shattered all over the floor.
"I'll do it, Hagrid," said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting
to clean up the mess.
"There's another one in the cupboard," Hagrid said, sitting down and
wiping his forehead on his sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back
hopelessly.
"Isn't there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?" Harry asked fiercely,
sitting down next to him. "Dumbledore --"
"He's tried," said Hagrid. "He's got no power ter overrule the
Committee. He told 'em Buckbeak's all right, but they're scared.... Yeh
know what Lucius Malfoy's like... threatened 'em, I expect... an' the
executioner, Macnair, he's an old pal o' Malfoy's... but it'll be quick
an' clean... an' I'll be beside him.... "
Hagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though
looking for some shred of hope or comfort.
"Dumbledore's gonna come down while it -- while it happens. Wrote me
this mornin'. Said he wants ter -- ter be with me. Great man,
Dumbledore...."
Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid's cupboard for another
milk
jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with the
new jug in her hands, fighting back tears.
"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid," she began, but Hagrid shook his
shaggy head.
"Yeh're ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don' wan' yeh
watchin'. An' yeh shouldn' be down here anyway... If Fudge an'
Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh'll be in big
trouble."
Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione's face, but she hid them
from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk
bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.
"Ron, I don't believe it -- it's Scabbers!"
Ron gaped at her.
"What are you talking about?"
Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside
down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside,
Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.
"Scabbers!" said Ron blankly. "Scabbers, what are you doing here?"
He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers
looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had
fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron's hands as
though desperate to free himself
"It's okay, Scabbers!" said Ron. "No cats! There's nothing here to hurt
you!"
Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally
ruddy face had gone the color of parchment.
"They're comin'...."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking
down
the distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver
beard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge.
Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner,
Macnair.
"Yeh gotta go," said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. "They
mustn' find yeh here.... Go now..."
Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak.
"I'll let yeh out the back way," said Hagrid.
They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely
unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away,
tethered
to a tree behind Hagrid's Pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to know
something was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side and
pawed the ground nervously.
"It's okay, Beaky," said Hagrid softly. "It's okay..." He turned to
Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Go on," he said. "Get goin'."
But they didn't move.
"Hagrid, we can't --"
"We'll tell them what really happened --"
"They can't kill him --"
"Go!" said Hagrid fiercely. "It's bad enough without you lot in trouble
an' all!"
They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron,
they
heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where
they had just vanished from sight.
"Go quick," he said hoarsely. "Don' listen...."
And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door.
Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off
silently around Hagrid's house. As they reached the other side, the
front door closed with a sharp snap.
"Please, let's hurry," Hermione whispered. "I can't stand it, I can't
bear it...."
They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking
fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the
west there was a ruby-red glow.
Ron stopped dead.
"Oh, please, Ron," Hermione began.
"It's Scabbers -- he won't -- stay put --"
Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat
was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to
sink his teeth into Ron's hand.
"Scabbers, it's me, you idiot, it's Ron," Ron hissed.
They heard a door open behind them and men's voices.
"Oh, Ron, please let's move, they're going to do it!" Hermione breathed.
"Okay -- Scabbers, stay put --"
They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to
the rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again.
"I can't hold him -- Scabbers, shut up, everyone'll hear us --"
The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the
sounds drifting from Hagrid's garden. There was a jumble of indistinct
male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable
swish and thud of an axe.
Hermione swayed on the spot.
"They did it!" she whispered to Harry. "I d -- don't believe it -- they
did it!"
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
CAT, RAT, AND DOG
Harry's mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood
transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays
of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long- shadowed
grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.
"Hagrid," Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he
made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms.
"We can't," said Ron, who was paper-white. "He'll be in worse trouble if
they know we've been to see him...."
Hermione's breathing was shallow and uneven.
"How -- could -- they?" she choked. "How could they?"
"Come on," said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.
They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves
hidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now.
By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell
around them.
"Scabbers, keep still," Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest.
The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force
Scabbers deeper into his pocket. "What's the matter with you, You stupid
rat? Stay still -- OUCH! He bit me!"
"Ron, be quiet!" Hermione whispered urgently. "Fudge'll be out here in a
minute --"
"He won't -- stay -- put --"
Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might,
trying to break free of Ron's grip.
"What's the matter with him?"
But Harry had just seen -- stinking toward them, his body low to the
ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness -- Crookshanks.
Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers's
squeaks, Harry couldn't tell.
"Crookshanks!" Hermione moaned. "No, go away, Crookshanks! Go
away!"
But the cat was getting nearer --
"Scabbers -- NO!"
Too late -- the rat had slipped between Ron's clutching fingers, hit the
ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after
him,
and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron had thrown the
Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.
"Ron!" Hermione moaned.
She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it ""as
impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it
streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could
hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.
"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --"
There was a loud thud.
"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --"
Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in
front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in
his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.
"Ron -- come on back under the cloak --" Hermione panted. "Dumbledore
the Minister -- they'll be coming back out in a minute --"
But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even
catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws....
Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow -- an enormous,
pale-eyed, jet-black dog.
Harry reached for his wand, but too late -- the dog had made an enormous
leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in
a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch- long teeth -
But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him.
Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up;
he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.
Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry
aside; the dog's jaws fastened instead around Ron's outstretched arm.
Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute's hair, but it
was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll --
Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was
knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall
too.
Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes
"Lumos!"he whispered.
The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased
Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were
creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to
stop
them going nearer.
And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward
into a large gap in the roots -- Ron was fighting furiously, but his
head and torso were slipping out of sight --
"Ron!" Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped
lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.
All they could see now was one of Ron's legs, which he had hooked
around
a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground
-- but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron's leg had
broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.
"Harry -- we've got to go for help --" Hermione gasped; she was bleeding
too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder.
"No! That thing's big enough to eat him; we haven't got time --"
"Harry -- we're never going to get through without help --"
Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.
"If that dog can get in, we can," Harry panted, darting here and there,
trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he
couldn't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of
the tree's blows.
"Oh, help, help," Hermione whispered frantically, dancing certainly
on the spot, "Please..."
Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches
like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.
Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped
moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.
"Crookshanks!" Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped
Harry's
arm painfully hard. "How did he know --?"
"He's friends with that dog," said Harry grimly. "I've seen them
together. Come on -- and keep your wand out --"
They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had
reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick
of his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst,
and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel.
Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from
Harry's wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him.
"Where's Ron?" she whispered in a terrified voice.
"This way," said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.
"Where does this tunnel come out?" Hermione asked breathlessly from
behind him.
"I don't know... It's marked on the Marauder's Map but Fred and George
said no one's ever gotten into it.... It goes off the edge of the map,
but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade..."
They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them,
Crookshanks's tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the
passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes.... All Harry
could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to
him.... He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a
crouch....
And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and
Crookshanks had gone. instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light
through a small opening.
He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised
their wands to see what lay beyond.
It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the
walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture
was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all
boarded up.
Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.
Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was
deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy
hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry's arm again. Her wide eyes
were
traveling around the boarded windows.
"Harry," she whispered, "I think we're in the Shrieking Shack."
Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large
chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off
entirely.
"Ghosts didn't do that," he said slowly.
At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had Moved
upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione's grip on
Harry's arm was so tight he was losing feeling in-his fingers. He raised
his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.
Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and UP the crumbling
staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the
floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being
dragged upstairs.
They reached the dark landing.
"Nox," they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands
went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard
movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring.
They
exchanged a last look, a last nod.
Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.
On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks,
purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching
his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.
Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.
"Ron -- are you okay?"
"Where's the dog?"
"Not a dog," Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. "Harry, it's
a trap --"
"What --"
"He's the dog... he's an Animagus."
Ron was staring over Harry's shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a
snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.
A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn't been
shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The
waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked
like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius
Black.
"Expelliarmus!"he croaked, pointing Ron's wand at them.
Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the air,
and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed
on Harry.
"I thought you'd come and help your friend," he said hoarsely.
His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using
it. "Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you) not to
run for a teacher. I'm grateful... it will make everything much
easier...."
The taunt about his father rang in Harry's ears as though Black had
bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry's chest, leaving no place
for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his
hand, not to defend himself, but to attack... to kill. Without knowing
what he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movement
on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him
back.... "No, Harry!" Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron,
however, spoke to Black.
"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!" he said
fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of
still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.
Something flickered in Black's shadowed eyes.
"Lie down," he said quietly to Ron. "You will damage that leg even
more."
"Did you hear me?" Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to
Harry to stay upright. "You'll have to kill all three of us!"
"There'll be only one murder here tonight," said Brack, and his grin
widened.
"Why's that?" Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron, and
Hermione. "Didn't care last time, did you? Didn't mind slaughtering all
those Muggles to get at Pettigrew... What's the matter, gone soft in
Azkaban?"
"Harry!" Hermione whimpered. "Be quiet!"
"HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!" Harry roared, and with a huge
effort he
broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward -
He had forgotten about magic -- he had forgotten that he was short and
skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man -- all
Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and
that he didn't care how much he got hurt in return --
Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black
didn't raise the wands in time -- one of Harry's hands fastened over his
wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry's other
hand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell, backward,
into the wall -
Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as
the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed
Harry's face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers
twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of
Black it could find.
But Black's free hand had found Harry's throat
"No," he hissed, "I've waited too long --"
The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.
Then he saw Hermione's foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry
with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black's wand hand and
Harry heard a faint clatter --
He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling
across the floor; he threw himself toward it but
"Argh!"
Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk
themselves deep into Harry's arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks
now darted toward Harry's wand --
"NO YOU DON'T!" roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks
that
made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned
-
"Get out of the way!" he shouted at Ron and Hermione.
They didn't need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip
bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron's wands. Ron
crawled
to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now
tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.
Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and
fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand
pointing straight at Black's heart.
"Going to kill me, Harry?" he whispered.
Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black's chest,
looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black's left eye
and his nose was bleeding.
"You killed my parents," said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his
wand hand quite steady.
Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.
"I don't deny it," he said very quietly. "But if you knew the whole
story."
"The whole story?" Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. "You
sold them to Voldemort. That's all I need to know."
"You've got to listen to me," Black said, and there was a note of
urgency in his voice now. "You'll regret it if you don't.... You don't
understand...."
"I understand a lot better than you think," said Harry, and his voice
shook more than ever. "You never heard her, did you? My mum... trying
to
stop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it...."
Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked
past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black's chest and settled himself
there, right over Black's heart. Black blinked and looked down at the
cat.
"Get off," he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.
But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black's robes and wouldn't shift. He
turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those
great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.
Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the
wand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in league with
Black.... If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that
wasn't Harry's business.... If Black wanted to save it, that only proved
he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry's parents....
Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the
moment
to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to
kill Black. This was his chance....
The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised,
Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron's ragged
breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.
And then came a new sound -
Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was
moving downstairs.
"WE'RE UP HERE!" Hermione screamed suddenly. "WE'RE UP HERE --
SIRIUS
BLACK - QUICK!"
Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks;
Harry
gripped his wand convulsively -- Do it now! said a voice in his head --
but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn't
done it.
The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry
wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face
bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying
on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry,
standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself,
crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet.
"Expelliarmus!" Lupin shouted.
Harry's wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione
was
holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring
at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying Protectively across his chest.
Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn't done it. His nerve
had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the dementors.
Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.
"Where is he, Sirius?"
Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn't understannd what Lupin meant.
Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.
Black's face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn't move
at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight
at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.
"But then..." Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he
was trying to read his mind, "... why hasn't he shown himself before
now? Unless" -- Lupin's eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeing
something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, "-- unless
he was the one... unless you switched... without telling me?"
Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin's face, Black nodded.
"Professor," Harry interrupted loudly, "what's going on --?"
But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice
die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at Black.
The Professor walked to Black's side, seized his hand, pulled him to his
feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a
brother.
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.
"DON'T BELIEVE IT!" Hermione screamed.
Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the
floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. "You -- you --"
"Hermione --"
"-- you and him!"
"Hermione, calm down --"
"I didn't tell anyone!" Hermione shrieked. "I've been covering up for
you --"
"Hermione, listen to me, please'" Lupin shouted. "I can explain --"
Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave
of fury.
"I trusted you," he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of
control, "and all the time you've been his friend!"
"You're wrong," said Lupin. "I haven't been Sirius's friend, but I am
now -- Let me explain...."
"NO!" Hermione screamed. "Harry, don't trust him, he's been helping
Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too -- he's a werewolf!"
There was a ringing silence. Everyone's eyes were now on Lupin, who
looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.
"Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione," he said. "Only one out
of three, I'm afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle
and I certainly don't want Harry dead. An odd shiver passed over his
face. "But I won't deny that I am a werewolf."
Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper
of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, "Get
away ftom me, werewolf!"
Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione
and said, "How long have you known?"
"Ages," Hermione whispered. "Since I did Professor Snape's essay..."
"He'll be delighted," said Lupin coolly. "He assigned that essay hoping
someone would realize what my symptoms meant.... Did you check the
lunar
chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you
realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?"
"Both," Hermione said quietly.
Lupin forced a laugh.
"You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione."
"I'm not," Hermione whispered. "If I'd been a bit cleverer, I'd have
told everyone what you are!"
"But they already know," said Lupin. "At least, the staff do."
"Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf. Ron gasped.
"Is
he mad?"
"Some of the staff thought so," said Lupin. "He had to work very hard to
convince certain teachers that I'm trustworthy --"
"AND HE WAS WRONG!" Harry yelled. "YOUVE BEEN HELPING
HIM ALL THE TIME!"
He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed
and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt
up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from
both of them, dragging his leg.
I have not been helping Sirius," said Lupin. "If you'll give me a
chance, I'll explain. Look --"
He separated Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's wands and threw each back to
its owner; Harry caught his, stunned.
There, said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt "You're
armed, we're not. Now will you listen?"
Harry didn't know what to think. Was it a trick?
"If you haven't been helping him," he said, with a furious glance at
Black, "how did you know he was here?"
"The map," said Lupin. "The Marauder's Map. I was in my office
examining
it --"
"You know how to work it?" Harry said suspiciously.
"Of course I know how to work it," said Lupin, waving his hand
impatiently. "I helped write it. I'm Moony -- that was my friends'
nickname for me at school."
"You wrote --?"
"The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening,
because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak
out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed.
And I was right, wasn't I"
He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of
dust rose at his feet.
"You might have been wearing your father's old cloak, Harry--"
"How d'you know about the cloak?"
"The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...," said Lupin,
waving an impatient hand again. "The point is, even if you're wearing an
Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder's Map. I watched
you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid's hut. Twenty minutes later, you
left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now
accompanied by somebody else."
"What?" said Harry. "No, we weren't!"
I couldn't believe my eyes," said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring
Harry's interruption. "I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How
could he be with you?" "No one was with us!" said Harry.
"And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius
Black.... I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you
into the Whomping Willow --"
"One of us!" Ron said angrily.
"No, Ron," said Lupin. "Two of you."
He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.
"Do you think I could have a look at the rat?" he said evenly.
"What?" said Ron. "What's Scabbers got to do with it?"
"Everything," said Lupin. "Could I see him, please?"
Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged,
thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him
escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissing
noise.
Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he
gazed intently at Scabbers.
"What?" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared.
"What's my rat got to do with anything?"
"That's not a rat," croaked Sirius Black suddenly.
"What d'you mean -- of course he's a rat --"
"No, he's not," said Lupin quietly. "He's a wizard."
"An Animagus," said Black, "by the name of Peter Pettigrew."
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADDFOOT, AND PRONGS
It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in.
Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.
"You're both mental."
"Ridiculous!" said Hermione faintly.
"Peter Pettigrew's dead!" said Harry. "He killed him twelve years ago!"
He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.
"I meant to," he growled, his yellow teeth bared, "but little Peter got
the better of me... not this time, though!"
And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers;
Ron
yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg.
."Sirius, NO!" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging
Black away from Ron again, "WAIT! You can't do it just like that -- they
need to understand -- we've got to explain --"
"We can explain afterwards!" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off.
One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who
was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried
to escape.
"They've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything!" Lupin
panted, still trying to restrain Black. "Ron's kept him as a pet! There
are parts of it even I don't understand, and Harry -- you owe Harry the
truth, Sirius!"
Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on
Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, ad
bleeding hands.
"All right, then," Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat.
"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit
the murder I was imprisoned for..."
"You're nutters, both of you," said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry
and Hermione for support. "I've had enough of this. I'm off."
He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand
again, pointing it at Scabbers.
"You're going to hear me out, Ron," he said quietly. "Just keep a tight
hold on Peter while you listen."
"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat
back
into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and
overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed.
Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.
There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die," he said. "A whole street
full of them..."
"They didn't see what they thought they saw!" said Black savagely, still
watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands.
"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter," said Lupin, nodding. "I believed
it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map
never lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry."
Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently:
Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense
whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have
unhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him?
Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as
though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.
"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be
true, you know it can't..."
"Why can't it be true?" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class,
and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with
grindylows.
"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an
Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I
looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps
tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register
showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I
went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have
been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the
list."
Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put
into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.
"Light again, Hermione!" he said. "But the Ministry never knew that here
used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts."
"I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus," said
Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. "I've
waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer."
"All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius," said Lupin, I only
know how it began..."
Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom
door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then
Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.
"No one there..."
"This place is haunted!" said Ron.
"It's not," said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. "The
Shrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls the
villagers used to hear were made by me."
He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then
said, "That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf,
None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if I
hadn't been so foolhardy..."
He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said,
"Shh!" She was watching Lupin very intently.
"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried
everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that
Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It
makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the
full moon, I keep my mind when I transform.... I'm able to curl up in my
office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.
"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully
fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able
to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children
exposed to me.
"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He
said
that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I
shouldn't come to school...." Lupin sighed, and looked directly at
Harry. "I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted
the
year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came
to Hogwarts. This house" -- Lupin looked miserably around the room, --
"the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use. Once a
month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform.
The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me
while I was dangerous."
Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listening
raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was
Scabbers's frightened squeaking.
"My transformations in those days were -- were terrible. It is very
painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so
I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and
the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent
spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor.... Even now, when the house
has been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it...."
"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been
in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends.
Sirius Black... Peter Pettigrew... and, of course, your father, Harry --
James Potter."
"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared
once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was
ill, and that I had to go home to see her... I was terrified they would
desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they,
like you, Hermione, worked out the truth...."
"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me
that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times
of my life. They became Animagi."
"My dad too?" said Harry, astounded.
"Yes, indeed," said Lupin. "It took them the best part of three years to
work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest
students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus
transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps a
close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he
could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they
managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will."
"But how did that help you?" said Hermione, sounding puzzled.
"They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as
animals," said Lupin. "A werewolf is only a danger to people. They
sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak.
They transformed... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the
Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They
would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I
became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to
become less so while I was with them."
"Hurry up, Remus," snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a
horrible sort of hunger on his face.
"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there... well, highly exciting
possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we
were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the
village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals,
they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts
students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade
than we did.... And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and
sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James
was Prongs."
"What sort of animal --?" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off.
"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a
werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?"
"A thought that still haunts me," said Lupin heavily. "And there were
near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were
young, thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness."
I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course...
he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have
done
so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my
own and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students
into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my
guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's
adventure. And I haven't changed..."
Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. "All
this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should
tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why?
Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd
betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others
along with me... and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He
let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been
shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I
am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school
using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had
nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all
along."
"Snape?" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first
time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. "What's Snape got to do with
it?"
"He's here, Sirius," said Lupin heavily. "He's teaching here as well."
He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my
appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been
telling Dumbledore A year that I am not to be trusted. He has his
reasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly
killed him, a trick which involved me --"
Black made a derisive noise.
"It served him right," he sneered. "Sneaking around, trying to find out
what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled...."
"Severus was very interested in where I went every month." Lupin told
Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "We were in the same year, you know, and we
--
er -- didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James.
Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field... anyway
Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one
evening as
she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it
would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the
knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in
after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if he'd got as far as this
house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who'd
heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at
great risk to his life... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the
tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that
time on he knew what I was...."
"So that's why Snape doesn't like you," said Harry slowly, "because he
thought you were in on the joke?"
"That's right," sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin.
Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing,
directly at Lupin.
CHAPTER NINETEEN
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT
Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd
received a huge electric shock.
"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow," said Snape, throwing
the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's
chest. "Very useful, Potter, I thank you...."
Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed
triumph. "You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?" he
said,
his eyes glittering. "I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot
to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky
I did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One
glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this
passageway and out of sight."
"Severus --" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.
"I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old
friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof. Not even I
dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout
--"
"Severus, you're making a mistake," said Lupin urgently. "You haven't
heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry
--"
"Two more for Azkaban tonight," said Snape, his eyes now gleaming
fanatically. "I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this....
He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame
werewolf --"
"You fool," said Lupin softly. "Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an
innocent man back inside Azkaban?"
BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and
twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; he
overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage,
Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between
Black's eyes.
"Give me a reason," he whispered. "Give me a reason to do it, and I
swear I will."
Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face
showed more hatred.
Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe.
He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as
he
did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione,
however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very
breathless voice, "Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear what
they've got to say, w -- would it?"
"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,"
Snape spat. "You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company
of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your
tongue."
"But if -- if there was a mistake --"
"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!" Snape shouted, looking suddenly
quite
deranged. "DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND!" A few sparks
shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's
face. Hermione fell silent.
"Vengeance is very sweet," Snape breathed at Black. "How I hoped I
would
be the one to catch you...."
"The joke's on you again, Severus," Black snarled. "As long as this boy
brings his rat up to the castle" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- "I'll
come quietly...."
"Up to the castle?" said Snape silkily. "I don't think we need to go
that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the
Willow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black... pleased enough to
give you a little kiss, I daresay... I --"
What little color there was in Blacks face left it.
"You -you've got to hear me out," he croaked. "The rat -- look at the
rat --"
But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen
before. He seemed beyond reason.
"Come on, all of you," he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of
the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. "I'll drag the werewolf.
Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --"
Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three
strides and blocked the door.
"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already," snarled
Snape. "If I hadn't been here to save your skin --"
"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,"
Harry said. "I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense
lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he
just finish me off then?"
"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works," hissed Snape.
"Get out of the way, Potter."
"YOURE PATHETIC!" Harry yelled. "JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE
A FOOL OF YOU AT
SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN --"
"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!" Snape
shrieked, looking
madder than ever. "Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your
neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been
well
served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too
arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the
way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!"
Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even
one step toward him, he had raised his wand.
"Expelliarmus!" he yelled -- except that his wasn't the only voice that
shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges;
Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down
it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had
been knocked out.
Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape
at
exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed
on
the bed next to Crookshanks.
"You shouldn't have done that," said Black, looking at Harry.
"You should have left him to me...."
Harry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the
right thing.
"We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher..." Hermione whimpered,
staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. "Oh, we're going to
be in so much trouble --"
Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and
untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had
cut into them.
"Thank you, Harry," he said.
"I'm still not saying I believe you," he told Lupin.
"Then it's time we offered you some proof," said Lupin. "You, boy --
give me Peter, please. Now."
Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.
"Come off it," he said weakly. "Are you trying to say he broke out of
Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean..." He looked up at
Harry and Hermione for support, "Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a
rat -- there are millions of rats -- how's he supposed to know which one
he's after if he was locked up in Azkaban?"
"You know, Sirius, that's a fair question," said Lupin, turning to Black
and frowning slightly. "How did you find out where he was?"
Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a
crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the
others.
It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the
Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron's shoulder, was
Scabbers.
"How did you get this?" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.
"Fudge," said Black. "When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave
me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy's
shoulder... I knew him at once... how many times had I seen him
transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to
Hogwarts... to where Harry was...
"My God," said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the
paper and back again. "His front paw..."
"What about it?" said Ron defiantly.
"He's got a toe missing," said Black.
"Of course," Lupin breathed. "So simple... so brilliant... he cut it off
himself?"
"Just before he transformed," said Black. "When I cornered him, he
yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James.
Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand
behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and
sped down into the sewer with the other rats...."
"Didn't you ever hear, Ron?" said Lupin. "The biggest bit of Peter they
found was his finger."
"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He's
been in my family for ages, right --"
"Twelve years, in fact," said Lupin. "Didn't you ever wonder why he was
living so long?"
"We -- we've been taking good care of him!" said Ron.
"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?" said Lupin. "I'd
guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the
loose again...."
"He's been scared of that mad cat!" said Ron, nodding toward
Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed.
But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly... Scabbers had been
looking ill before he met Crookshanks... ever since Ron's return from
Egypt... since the time when Black had escaped....
"This cat isn't mad," said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand
and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head. "He's the most intelligent of his
kind I've ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And
when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted
me.... Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and
he's been helping me. .. "What do you mean?" breathed Hermione.
"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn't... so he stole the
passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me.... As I understand it, he took
them from a boy's bedside table...."
Harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was
hearing. It was absurd... and yet...
"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it." croaked Black.
"This cat -- Crookshanks, did you call him? -- told me Peter had left
blood on the sheets.... I supposed he bit himself... Well, faking his
own death had worked once."
These words jolted Harry to his senses.
"And why did he fake his death?" he said furiously. "Because he knew you
were about to kill him like you killed my parents!"
"No," said Lupin, "Harry-"
"And now you've come to finish him off!"
"Yes, I have," said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.
"Then I should've let Snape take you!" Harry shouted.
"Harry," said Lupin hurriedly, "don't you see? All this time we've
thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down -- but
it was the other way around, don't you see? Peter betrayed your mother
and father -- Sirius tracked Peter down --"
"THAT'S NOT TRUE!" Harry yelled. "HE WAS THEIR SECRETKEEPER! HE SAID SO
BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!"
He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes
were suddenly over bright.
"Harry... I as good as killed them," he croaked. "I persuaded Lily and
James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him
as Secret-Keeper instead of me.... I'm to blame, I know it.... The night
they died, I'd arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe,
but when I arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone. Yet there was no sign
of a struggle. It didn't feel right. I was scared. I set out for your
parents' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and
their bodies... I realized what Peter must've done... what I'd done...."
His voice broke. He turned away.
"Enough of this," said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice
Harry had never heard before. "There's one certain way to prove what
really happened. Ron, give me that rat."
"What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?" Ron asked
Lupin tensely.
"Force him to show himself," said Lupin. "If he really is a rat, it
won't hurt him."
Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took
him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning,
his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. "Ready, Sirius?" said Lupin.
Black had already retrieved Snape's wand from the bed. He approached
Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be
burning in his face.
"Together?" he said quietly.
"I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his
wand in the other. "On the count of three. One -- two -- THREE!"
A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment,
Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly -- Ron
yelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding
flash of light and then --
It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was
shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a
man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his
hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his
back was standing up.
He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His
thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on
top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of
weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers's
fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his
very small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing
fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.
"Well, hello, Peter," said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently
erupted into old school friends around him. "Long time, no see.
"S -- Sirius... R -- Remus..." Even Pettigrew's voice was squeaky.
Again, his eyes darted toward the door. "My friends... my old
friends..."
Black's wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a
warning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and
casual.
"We've been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night
Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you
were squeaking around down there on the bed --"
"Remus," gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking
out over his pasty face, "you don't believe him, do you...? He tried to
kill me, Remus...."
"So we've heard," said Lupin, more coldly. "I'd like to clear up one or
two little matters with you, Peter, if you'll be so --"
"He's come to try and kill me again!" Pettigrew squeaked suddenly,
pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because
his index was missing. "He killed Lily and James and now he's going to
kill me too.... You've got to help me, Remus...."
Black's face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew
with his fathomless eyes.
"No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things
out," said Lupin.
"Sorted things out?" squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once
more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again' the only door. "I
knew he'd come after me! I knew he'd be back for me! I've been waiting
for this for twelve years!"
"You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?" said Lupin, his
brow furrowed. "When nobody has ever done it before?"
"He's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!" Pettigrew
shouted shrilly. "How else did he get out of there? I suppose
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!"
Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the
whole room.
"Voldemort, teach me tricks?" he said.
Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him.
"What, scared to hear your old master's name?" said Black. I don't blame
you, Peter. His lot aren't very happy with you, are they?"
"Don't know what you mean, Sirius --" muttered Pettigrew, his breathing
faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now.
"You haven't been hiding from me for twelve years," said Black. "You've
been hiding from Voldemort's old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban,
Peter... They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them....
I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds
like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went
to the Potters' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfall
there. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they?
There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they've
seen the error of their ways.
If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter --"
"Don't know... what you're talking about...," said Pettigrew again, more
shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at
Lupin. "You don't believe this -- this madness, Remus --"
"I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent
man would want to spend twelve years as a rat," said Lupin evenly.
"Innocent, but scared!" squealed Pettigrew. "If Voldemort's supporters
were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban --
the spy, Sirius Black!"
Black's face contorted.
"How dare you," he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he
had been. I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people
who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter -- I'll
never understand why I didn't see you were the spy from the start. You
always liked big friends who'd look after you, didn't you? It used to be
us... me and Remus... and James....
Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath.
"Me, a spy... must be out of your mind... never... don't know how you
can say such a --"
"Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,"
Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. "I
thought it was the perfect plan... a bluff... Voldemort would be sure to
come after me, would never dream they'd use a weak, talentless thing
like you.... It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life,
telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters."
Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like
"far-fetched" and "lunacy," but he couldn't help paying more attention
to the ashen color of Pettigrew's face and the way his eyes continued to
dart toward the windows and door.
"Professor Lupin?" said Hermione timidly. "Can -- can I say something?"
"Certainly, Hermione," said Lupin courteously.
"Well -- Scabbers -- I mean, this -- this man -- he's been sleeping in
Harry's dormitory for three years. If he's working for You-Know-Who,
how
come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?"
"There!" said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed hand.
"Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry's head!
Why should I?"
"I'll tell you why," said Black. "Because you never did anything for
anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort's been in
hiding for fifteen years, they say he's half dead. You weren't about to
commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore's nose, for a wreck of a
wizard who'd lost all of his power, were you? You'd want to be quite
sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to
him, wouldn't you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in?
Keeping an ear out for news, weren't YOU, Peter? Just in case your old
protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him...."
Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to
have lost the ability to talk.
"Er -- Mr. Black -- Sirius?" said Hermione.
Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as
though he had never seen anything quite like her.
"If you don't mind me asking, how -- how did you get out of Azkaban, if
you didn't use Dark Magic?"
"Thank you!" gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. "Exactly!
Precisely what I --"
But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at
Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He seemed to be
pondering his answer.
"I don't know how I did it," he said slowly. "I think the only reason I
never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn't a happy
thought, so the dementors couldn't suck it out of me... but it kept me
sane and knowing who I am... helped me keep my powers... so when it all
became ... too much... I could transform in my cell... become a dog.
Dementors can't see, you know...." He swallowed. "They feel their way
toward people by feeding off their emotions.... They could tell that my
feelings were less -- less human, less complex when I was a dog... but
they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in
there, so it didn't trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had
no hope of driving them away from me without a wand...."
"But then I saw Peter in that picture... I realized he was at Hogwarts
with Harry... perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears
that the Dark Side was gathering strength again...."
Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all
the while at Black as though hypnotized.
"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies... and to
deliver the last Potter to them. if he gave them Harry, who'd dare say
he'd betrayed Lord Voldemort? He'd be welcomed back with honors....
"So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter
was still alive...."
Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Wealsey. "The guards
say
he's been talking in his sleep... always the same words... 'He's at
Hogwarts.'"
"It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head, and the dementors
couldn't destroy it.... It wasn't a happy feeling... it was an
obsession... but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night
when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog....
It's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were
confused.... I was thin, very thin... thin enough to slip through the
bars.... I swam as a dog back to the mainland.... I journeyed north and
slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I've been living in the
forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course.
You fly as well as your father did, Harry...."
He looked at Harry, who did not look away.
"Believe me," croaked Black. "Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James
and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them."
And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he
nodded.
"No!"
Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry's nod had been his own
death sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his hands
clasped in front of him as though praying.
"Sirius -- it's me... it's Peter... your friend... you wouldn't --"
Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.
"There's enough filth on my robes without you touching them," said
Black.
"Remus!" Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing
imploringly in front of him. "You don't believe this wouldn't Sirius
have told you they'd changed the plan?"
"Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter," said Lupin. "I assume that's
why you didn't tell me, Sirius?" he said casually over Pettigrews head.
"Forgive me, Remus," said Black.
"Not at all, Padfoot, old friend," said Lupin, who was now rolling up
his sleeves. "And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were
the spy?"
"Of course," said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his
gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. "Shall we kill him
together?"
"Yes, I think so," said Lupin grimly.
"You wouldn't... you won't...," gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled
around to Ron.
"Ron... haven't I been a good friend... a good pet? You won't let them
kill me, Ron, will you... you're on my side, aren't you.
But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion.
"I let you sleep in my bed!" he said.
"Kind boy... kind master..." Pettigrew crawled toward Ron "You won't let
them do it.... I was your rat.... I was a good pet...."
"If you made a better rat than a human, it's not much to boast about,
Peter," said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched
his broken leg out of Pettigrew's reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees,
staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione's robes.
"Sweet girl... clever girl... you -- you won't let them.... Help me...."
Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew's clutching hands and backed
away against the wall, looking horrified.
Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and-turned his head slowly
toward Harry.
"Harry... Harry... you look just like your father... just like him...."
"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?" roared Black. "HOW DARE
YOU FACE HIM? HOW
DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?"
"Harry," whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched.
"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed.... James would have
understood, Harry... he would have shown me mercy..."
Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew's shoulders, and
threw him backward onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror,
staring up at them.
"You sold Lily and James to Voldemort," said Black, who was shaking
too.
"Do you deny it?"
Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized,
balding baby, cowering on the floor.
"Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord... you have no
idea... he has weapons you can't imagine.... I was scared, Sirius, I was
never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen....
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me --"
"DON'T LIE!" bellowed Black. "YOU'D BEEN PASSING
INFORMATION TO HIM FOR
A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!"
"He -- he was taking over everywhere!" gasped Pettigrew. "Wh -- what
was
there to be gained by refusing him?"
"What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has
ever existed?" said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. "Only
innocent lives, Peter!"
"You don't understand!" whined Pettigrew. "He would have killed me,
Sirius!"
"THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!" roared Black. "DIED RATHER
THAN BETRAY YOUR
FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!"
Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised.
"You should have realized," said Lupin quietly, "if Voldemort didn't
kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter."
Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall.
"NO!" Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front Pettigrew,
facing the wands. "You can't kill him," he said breathlessly. "You
can't."
Black and Lupin both looked staggered.
"Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents," Black
snarled. "This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too,
without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more
to him than your whole family."
"I know," Harry panted. "We'll take him up to the castle. We'll hand him
over to the dementors.... He can go to Azkaban... but don't kill him."
"Harry!" gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry's knees.
"You -- thank you -- it's more than I deserve -- thank you --"
"Get off me," Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew's hands off him in disgust.
"I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it because -- I don't reckon my
dad would've wanted them to become killers -- just for you."
No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was
coming
in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at
each other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands.
"You're the only person who has the right to decide, Harry," said Black.
"But think... think what he did...."
"He can go to Azkaban," Harry repeated. "If anyone deserves that place,
he does...."
Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him.
"Very well," said Lupin. "Stand aside, Harry."
Harry hesitated.
"I'm going to tie him up," said Lupin. "That's all, I swear."
Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin's wand this
time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and
gagged.
"But if you transform, Peter," growled Black, his own wand pointing at
Pettigrew too, "we will kill you. You agree, Harry?"
Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that
Pettigrew could see him.
"Right," said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. "Ron, I can't mend bones
nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it's best if we just strap
your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing."
He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron's leg with his wand, and
muttered, "Ferula." Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to
a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on
the leg and didn't wince.
"That's better," he said. "Thanks."
"What about Professor Snape?" said Hermione in a small voice, looking
down at Snape's prone figure.
"There's nothing seriously wrong with him," said Lupin, bending over
Snape and checking his pulse. "You were just a little --
overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er -- perhaps it will be best if we
don't revive him until we're safety back in the castle. We can take him
like this...."
He muttered, "Mobilicorpus." As though invisible strings were tied to
Snape's wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position,
head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few
inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the
Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket.
"And two of us should be chained to this," said Black, nudging Pettigrew
with his toe. "Just to make sure."
"I'll do it," said Lupin.
"And me," said Ron savagely, limping forward.
Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright
again, left arm chained to Lupin's right, right arm to Ron's left. Ron's
face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers's true identity as a
personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way
out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.
CHAPTER TWENTY
THE DEMENTOR'S KISS
Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way
down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like
entrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting
creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up
by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and
Hermione brought up the rear.
Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron
had to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered
with his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel
in
single file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after
Black, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept
bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression
Black was making no effort to prevent this.
"You know what this means?" Black said abruptly to Harry as they made
their slow progress along the tunnel. "Turning Pettigrew in?"
"You' re free," said Harry.
"Yes...," said Black. "But I'm also -- I don't know if anyone ever told
you -- I'm your godfather."
"Yeah, I knew that," said Harry.
"Well... your parents appointed me your guardian," said Black stiffly.
"If anything happened to them..."
Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant?
"I'll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and
uncle," said Black. "But... well... think about it. Once my name's
cleared... if you wanted a... a different home..."
Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry's stomach.
"What -- live with you?" he said, accidentally cracking his head on a
bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. "Leave the Dursleys?"
"Of course, I thought you wouldn't want to," said Black quickly. "I
understand, I just thought I'd --"
"Are you insane?" said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Black's.
"Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can
I move in?"
Black turned right around to look at him; Snape's head was scraping the
ceiling but Black didn't seem to care.
"You want to?" he said. "You mean it?"
"Yeah, I mean it!" said Harry.
Black's gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon
it. The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years
younger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was
recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry's parents' wedding.
They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel.
Crookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his paw to the
knot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered upward
without any sound of savaging branches.
Black saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and
Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out.
The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant
windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was still
wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry's mind was buzzing. He
was
going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, his
parents' best friend.... He felt dazed.... What would happen when he
told the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they'd seen on
television... !
"One wrong move, Peter," said Lupin threateningly ahead. His wand was
still pointed sideways at Pettigrew's chest.
Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing
slowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black, his chin
bumping on his chest. And then -
A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their
party was bathed in moonlight.
Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had stopped abruptly.
Black froze. He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.
Harry could see Lupin's silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs
began to shake.
"Oh, my --" Hermione gasped. "He didn't take his potion tonight! He's
not safe!"
"Run," Black whispered. "Run. Now."
But Harry couldn't run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He leapt
forward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back.
"Leave it to me -- RUN!"
There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin's head was lengthening. So
was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on
his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks's
hair was on end again; he was backing away --
As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from
Harry's side. He had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog bounded
forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it,
the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from Ron
and Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other.
Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to
notice anything else. It was Hermione's scream that alerted him --
Pettigrew had dived for Lupin's dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his
bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light -- and Ron lay
motionless on the ground. Another bang -- Crookshanks flew into the air
and back to the earth in a heap.
"Expelliarmus." Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew;
Lupin's wand flew high into the air and out of sight. "Stay where you
are!" Harry shouted, running forward.
Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip
through the manacle on Ron's outstretched arm and heard a scurrying
through the grass.
There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf
taking flight; it was galloping into the forest --
"Sirius, he's gone, Pettigrew transformed!" Harry yelled.
Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at
Harry's words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his
paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds.
Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.
"What did he do to him?" Hermione whispered. Ron's eyes were only
half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could
hear him breathing, but he didn't seem to recognize them.
"I don't know...."
Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone... they had
no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair.
"We'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone," said Harry,
pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. "Come --"
But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a
whining: a dog in pain....
"Sirius," Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.
He had a moment's indecision, but there was nothing they could do for
Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble --
Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to
be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward
it, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what it
must mean -
The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw
why -- Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours,
his hands over his head.
'Nooo," he moaned. 'Nooo... please...."
And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding
in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the
familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his
vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were
encircling them....
"Herrnione, think of something happy!" Harry yelled, raising his wand,
blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid
it of the faint screaming that had started inside it --
I'm going to live with my godfather. I'm leaving the Dursleys.
He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant:
"Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum!"
Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground,
pale as death.
He'll be all right. I'm going to go and live with him.
"Expecto patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum!"
"Expecto --" Hermione whispered, "expecto -- expecto --"
But she couldn't do it. The dementors were closing in, barely ten feet
from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and
were
getting closer....
"EXPECTO PATRONUM!" Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming
from his
ears. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!"
A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him.
At the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him. He was
alone... completely alone....
"Expecto -- expecto patronum --"
Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes. With
a huge effort, he fought to remember -- Sirius was innocent -- innocent
-- We'll be okay -- I' mgoing to live with him --
"Ex ecto patronum!" he gasped.
By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, He saw a dementor halt,
very close to him. It couldn't walk through the cloud of silver mist
Harry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It
made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.
"No -- no --" Harry gasped. "He's innocent... expecto expecto patronum
--"
He could feet them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil
wind around him. The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him.
Then
it raised both its rotting hands -- and lowered its hood.
Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed
skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth... a
gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death
rattle.
A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn't move or speak. His
Patronus flickered and died.
White fog was blinding him. He had to fight... expecto patronum ... he
couldn't see... and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming...
expecto patronum... he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his
arm... they weren't going to take him....
But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around
Harry's neck. They were forcing his face upward.... He could feel its
breath.... It was going to get rid of him first.... He could feel its
putrid breath.... His mother was screaming in his ears.... She was going
to be the last thing he ever heard --
And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a
silvery light growing brighter and brighter... He felt himself fall
forward onto the grass.... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking,
Harry opened his eyes. The dementor must have released him. The
blinding
light was illuminating the grass around him.... The screaming had
stopped, the cold was ebbing away...
Something was driving the dementors back.... It was circling around him
and Black and Hermione.... They were leaving....
The air was warm again....
With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a
few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the
lake.... Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it
was.... It was as bright as a unicorn.... Fighting to stay conscious,
Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore. For
a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back...
raising his hand to pat it... someone who looked strangely familiar ...
but it couldn't be...
Harry didn't understand. He couldn't think anymore. He felt the last of
his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted.
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
HERMIONE'S SECRET
Shocking business... shocking... miracle none of them died... never
heard the like... by thunder, it was lucky you were there, Snape...."
"Thank you, Minister."
"Order of Merlin, Second Class, I'd say. First Class, if I can wangle
it!"
"Thank you very much indeed, Minister."
"Nasty cut you've got there.... Black's work, I suppose?"
"As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister...."
"No!"
"Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, to
judge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he
was innocent. They weren't responsible for their actions. On the other
hand, their interference might have permitted Black to escape.... They
obviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed. They've
got away with a great deal before now... I'm afraid it's given them a
rather high opinion of themselves... and of course Potter has always
been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster --"
"Ah, well, Snape... Harry Potter, you know... we've all got a bit of a
blind spot where he's concerned."
"And yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment?
Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other
student would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading his
friends into such danger. Consider, Minister -- against all school rules
-- after all the precautions put in place for his protection --
out-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer --
and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally
too --"
"Well, well... we shall see, Snape, we shall see.... The boy has
undoubtedly been foolish...."
Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. The
words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to
his brain, so that it was difficult to understand.... His limbs felt
like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift.... He wanted to lie here, on
this comfortable bed, forever....
"What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors... you've really
no idea what made them retreat, Snape?"
"No, Minister... by the time I had come 'round they were heading back to
their positions at the entrances...."
"Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl --"
"All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black,
naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back to
the castle."
There was a pause. Harry's brain seemed to be moving a little faster,
and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach....
He opened his eyes.
Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He
was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he
could make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a
bed.
Harry squinted. Ron's red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey's arm.
Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right lay
Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too.
She looked petrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake, pressed a
finger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar,
and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from
the corridor outside.
Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry's
bed.
He turned to took at her. She was carrying the largest block of
chocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder.
"Ah, you're awake!" she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on
Harry's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer.
"How's Ron?" said Harry and Hermione together.
"He'll live, said Madam Pomfrey grimly. "As for you two you'll be
staying here until I'm satisfied you're -- Potter, what do you think
you're doing?"
Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up his
wand.
"I need to see the headmaster," he said.
"Potter," said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, "it's all right. They've got
Black. He's locked away upstairs. The dementors will be performing the
kiss any moment now --"
"WHAT?"
Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout
had been heard in the corridor outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and
Snape had entered the ward.
"Harry, Harry, what's this?" said Fudge, looking agitated. "You should
be in bed -- has he had any chocolate?" he asked Madam Pomfrey
anxiously.
"Minister, listen!" Harry said. "Sirius Black's innocent! Peter
Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can't let the
dementors do that thing to Sirius, he's --"
But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face.
"Harry, Harry, you're very confused, you've been through a dreadful
ordeal, lie back down, now, we've got everything under control...."
"YOU HAVEN'T!" Harry yelled. "YOUVE GOT THE WRONG MAN!"
"Minister, listen, please," Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry's
side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge's face. "I saw him too. It
was Ron's rat, he's an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and --"
"You see, Minister?" said Snape. "Confunded, both of them.... Black's
done a very good job on them...." "WE'RE NOT CONFUNDED!" Harry
roared.
"Minister! Professor!" said Madam Pomfrey angrily. "I must insist that
you leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!"
"I'm not distressed, I'm trying to tell them what happened!" Harry said
furiously. "If they'd just listen --"
But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into
Harry's mouth; he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force him
back onto the bed.
"Now, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leave
The door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry swallowed his
mouthful
of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again.
"Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black --"
"For heaven's sake!" said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. "Is this a
hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist --"
"My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss
Granger," said Dumbledore calmly. "I have just been talking to Sirius
Black --"
"I suppose he's told you the same fairy tale he's planted in Potter's
mind?" spat Snape. "Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive --"
"That, indeed, is Black's story," said Dumbledore, surveying Snape
closely through his half-moon spectacles.
"And does my evidence count for nothing?" snarled Snape. "Peter
Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him
on the grounds."
"That was because you were knocked out, Professor!" said Hermione
earnestly. "You didn't arrive in time to hear
"Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!"
"Now, Snape," said Fudge, startled, "the young lady is disturbed in her
mind, we must make allowances --"
"I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone," said Dumbledore
abruptly. "Cornelius, Severus, Poppy -- please leave us."
"Headmaster!" sputtered Madam Pomfrey. "They need treatment, they
need
rest --"
"This cannot wait," said Dumbledore. "I must insist."
Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end
of the ward, slamming the door behind her. Fudge consulted the large
gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.
"The dementors should have arrived by now," he said. "I'll go and meet
them. Dumbledore, I'll see you upstairs."
He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn't
moved.
"You surely don't believe a word of Black's story?" Snape whispered, his
eyes fixed on Dumbledore's face.
"I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone," Dumbledore repeated.
Snape took a step toward Dumbledore.
"Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen," he
breathed. "You haven't forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven't forgotten
that he once tried to kill me?"
"My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus," said Dumbledore
quietly.
Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still
holding. It closed behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry and
Hermione. They both burst into speech at the same time.
"Professor, Black's telling the truth -- we saw Pettigrew "-- he escaped
when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf --"
"-- he's a rat --"
"-- Pettigrew's front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off --"
"-- Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn't Sirius --"
But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations.
"It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because
there is very little time," he said quietly. "There is not a shred of
proof to support Black's story, except your word -- and the word of two
thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of
eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave
evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters'
Secret-Keeper."
"Professor Lupin can tell you --" Harry said, unable to stop himself
"Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone
anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius
will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted
by most of our kind that his support will count for very little -- and
the fact that he and Sirius are old friends --"
"But --"
"Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see
that Professor Snape's version of events is far more convincing than
yours."
"He hates Sirius," Hermione said desperately. "All because of some
stupid trick Sirius played on him --"
"Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady
-- entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife -- without Pettigrew, alive or
dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius's sentence."
"But you believe us."
"Yes, I do," said Dumbledore quietly. "But I have no power to make other
men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic...."
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground
beneath him were falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea
that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to
pull
some amazing solution out of the air. But no ... their last hope was
gone.
"What we need," said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved
from Harry to Hermione, "is more time."
"But --" Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. "OH!"
"Now, pay attention," said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very
clearly. "Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick's office on the seventh
floor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes
well, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But
remember this, both of you: you must not be seen. Miss Granger, you
know
the law -- you know what is at stake.... You -- must -- not -- be --
seen."
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on
his
heel and looked back as he reached the door.
"I am going to lock you in. It is --" he consulted his watch, "five
minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck."
"Good luck?" Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore.
"Three
turns? What's he talking about? What are we supposed to do?"
But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling from
beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain.
"Harry, come here," she said urgently. "Quick!"
Harry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She was holding the
chain
out. He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it.
"Here --"
She had thrown the chain around his neck too.
"Ready?" she said breathlessly.
"What are we doing?" Harry said, completely lost.
Hermione turned the hourglass over three times.
The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was flying very
fast, backward. A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears
were pounding, he tried to yell but couldn't hear his own voice --
And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into
focus again --
He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a
stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the
open front doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the
hourglass cutting into his neck.
"Hermione, what --?"
"In here!" Hermione seized Harry's arm and dragged him across the hall
to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among
the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them.
"What -- how -- Hermione, what happened?"
"We've gone back in time," Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off
Harry's neck in the darkness. "Three hours back..."
Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot,
which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very
bizarre dream.
"But --"
"Shh! Listen! Someone's coming! I think -- I think it might be us!"
Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door.
"Footsteps across the hall... yes, I think it's us going down to
Hagrid's!"
"Are you telling me," Harry whispered, "that we're here in this cupboard
and we're out there too?"
"Yes," said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. "I'm
sure it's us. It doesn't sound like more than three people... and we're
walking slowly because we're under the Invisibility Cloak -- "
She broke off, still listening intently.
"We've gone down the front steps...."
Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious,
but Harry wanted a few questions answered.
"Where did you get that hourglass thing?"
"It's called a Time-Turner," Hermione whispered, "and I got it from
Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I've been using it all year
to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn't
tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of
Magic so I could have one. She had to tell them that I was a model
student, and that I'd never, ever use it for anything except my
studies.... I've been turning it back so I could do hours over again,
that's how I've been doing several lessons at once, see? But...
"Harry, I don't understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he
tell us to go back three hours? How's that going to help Sirius?"
Harry stared at her shadowy face.
"There must be something that happened around now he wants us to
change," he said slowly. "What happened? We were walking down to
Hagrid's three hours ago...."
"This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's," said
Hermione. "We just heard ourselves leaving...."
Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in
concentration.
"Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent
life...." And then it hit him. "Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!"
"But -- how will that help Sirius?"
"Dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of
Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to fly
Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on
Buckbeak -- they can escape together!"
From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified.
"If we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miracle!"
"Well, we've got to try, haven't we?" said Harry. He stood up and
pressed his ear against the door. "Doesn't sound like anyone's there....
Come on, let's go."
Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As
quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and
down the stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of
the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.
"If anyone's looking out of the window --" Hermione squeaked, looking up
at the castle behind them.
"We'll run for it," said Harry determinedly. "Straight into the forest,
all right? We'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a
lookout --"
"Okay, but we'll go around by the greenhouses!" said Hermione
breathlessly. "We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid's front door, or
we'll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid's by now!"
Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione
behind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses,
paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could,
skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the
forest....
Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later,
Hermione arrived beside him, panting.
"Right," she gasped. "We need to sneak over to Hagrid's.... Keep out of
sight, Harry...."
They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge
of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house, they
heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak
trunk
and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway,
shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry
heard his own voice.
"It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can
take it off."
"Yeh shouldn've come!" Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the
door quickly.
"This is the weirdest thing we've ever done," Harry said fervently.
"Let's move along a bit," Hermione whispered. "We need to get nearer to
Buckbeak!"
They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff,
tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch.
"Now?" Harry whispered.
"No!" said Hermione. "If we steal him now, those Committee people will
think Hagrid set him free! We've got to wait until they've seen he's
tied outside!"
"That's going to give us about sixty seconds," said Harry. This was
starting to seem impossible.
At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's
cabin.
"That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug," Hermione whispered. "I'm going to
find Scabbers in a moment --"
Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione's shriek of
surprise.
"Hermione," said Harry suddenly, "what if we -- we just run in there and
grab Pettigrew --"
"No!" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. "Don't you understand? We're
breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to
change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --"
"We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!"
"Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into
Hagrid's house?" said Hermione.
"I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad," said Harry, "or I'd think there was
some Dark Magic going on --"
"Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't
you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened
when wizards have meddled with time.... Loads of them ended up killing
their past or future selves by mistake!"
"Okay!" said Harry. "It was just an idea, I just thought
But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his
head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors.
Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the
executioner
were coming down the steps.
"We're about to come out!" Hermione breathed.
And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid's back door opened, and Harry
saw
himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was,
without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind
the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.
"It's Okay, Beaky, it's okay..." Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned
to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Go on. Get goin'."
"Hagrid, we can't --"
"We'll tell them what really happened
"They can't kill him --"
"Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!"
Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility
Cloak over him and Ron.
"Go quick. Don' listen...."
There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. The execution party had
arrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leaving
the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all
around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and
Hermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees
could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back
door.
"Where is the beast?" came the cold voice of Macnair.
"Out -- outside," Hagrid croaked.
Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at
Hagrid's window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.
"We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid.
I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair,
You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --"
Macnair's face vanished from the window. It was now or never.
"Wait here," Harry whispered to Hermione. "I'll do it."
As Fudge's voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree,
vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
"It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,
shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown --"
Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes
once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up
again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the
fence.
"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the
Committee's appointed executioner, Walden Macnai..."
"Come on, Buckbeak," Harry murmured, "come on, we're going to help
you.
Quietly... quietly..."
"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here..."
Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his
front feet.
"Well, let's get this over with," said the reedy voice of the Committee
member from inside Hagrid's cabin. "Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if
you stay inside --"
"No, I -- I wan' ter be with him.... I don' wan' him ter be alone --"
Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.
"Buckbeak, move!" Harry hissed.
Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak's neck. The hippogriff
began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet
away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid's back door. "One moment,
please, Macnair," came Dumbledore's voice. "You need to sign too." The
footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak
and walked a little faster.
Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.
"Harry, hurry!" she mouthed.
Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin.
He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot.
They had reached the trees....
"Quick! Quick!" Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,
seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.
Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they
couldn't see Hagrid's garden at all.
"Stop!" he whispered to Hermione. "They might hear us
Hagrid's back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and
Buckbeak
stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
Silence... then --
"Where is it?" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. "Where is
the beast?"
"It was tied here!" said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just
here!"
"How extraordinary," said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in
his voice.
"Beaky!" said Hagrid huskily.
There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner
seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the
howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his sobs.
"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself
free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!"
Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to
Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into
the forest floor to stop him.
"Someone untied him!" the executioner was snarling. "We should search
the grounds, the forest."
"Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the
thief will have led him away on foot?" said Dumbledore, still sounding
amused. "Search the skies, if you will.... Hagrid, I could do with a cup
of tea. Or a large brandy."
"O' -- o' course, Professor," said Hagrid, who sounded weak with
happiness. "Come in, come in...."
Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft
cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once
more.
"Now what?" whispered Harry, looking around.
"We'll have to hide in here," said Hermione, who looked very shaken. "We
need to wait until they've gone back to the castle. Then we wait until
it's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius's window. He won't be there for
another couple of hours.... Oh, this is going to be difficult...."
She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest.
The sun was setting now.
"We're going to have to move," said Harry, thinking hard. "We've got to
be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won't know what's going on."
"Okay," said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope. "But
we've got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember...."
They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly
around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through
which they could make out the Willow.
"There's Ron!" said Harry suddenly.
A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through
the still night air.
"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --"
And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry
watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.
"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --"
"There's Sirius!" said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out
from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize
Ron....
"Looks even worse from here, doesn't it?" said Harry, watching the dog
pulling Ron into the roots. "Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the
tree -- and so did you -- this is weird--"
The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower
branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to
reach the trunk. And then the tree froze.
"That was Crookshanks pressing the knot," said Hermione.
"And there we go..." Harry muttered. "We're in."
The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds
later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge,
and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.
"Right after we'd gone down into the passage!" said Hermione. "If only
Dumbledore had come with us..."
"Macnair and Fudge would've come too," said Harry bitterly. "I bet you
anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot...."
They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from
view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then --
"Here comes Lupin!" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting
down
the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the
sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely.
They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the
knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too,
disappeared into the gap in its roots.
"If he'd only grabbed the cloak," said Harry. "It's just lying
there...."
He turned to Hermione.
"If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get
it and --"
"Harry, we mustn't be seen!"
"How can you stand this?" he asked Hermione fiercely. "Just standing
here and watching it happen?" He hesitated. "I'm going to grab the
cloak!"
"Harry, no!"
Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon. just
then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to
the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he
walked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands.
"See?" Hermione whispered. "See what would have happened? We've got
to
keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!"
The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry
seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched
Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped
fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.
Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and
Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.
Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the
tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up.
"Get your filthy hands off it," Harry snarled under his breath. "Shh!"
Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the
knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak.
"So that's it," said Hermione quietly. "We're all down there... and now
we've just got to wait until we come back up again...."
She took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the
nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees.
"Harry, there's something I don't understand.... Why didn't the
dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed
out... there were so many of them...."
Harry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest
dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had
come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.
Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.
"But what was it?"
"There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,"
said Harry. "A real Patronus. A powerful one."
"But who conjured it?"
Harry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen
on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... but
how could it have been?
"Didn't you see what they looked like?" said Hermione eagerly. "Was it
one of the teachers?"
"No," said Harry. "He wasn't a teacher."
"But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those
dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it
light him up? Couldn't you see --?"
"Yeah, I saw him," said Harry slowly. "But... maybe I imagined it.... I
wasn't thinking straight.... I passed out right afterward...."
"Who did you think it was?"
I think --" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to
sound. I think it was my dad."
Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open
now.
She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity.
"Harry, your dad's -- well -- dead," she said quietly.
"I know that," said Harry quickly.
"You think you saw his ghost?"
"I don't know... no... he looked solid...."
"But then --"
"Maybe I was seeing things," said Harry. "But... from what I could
see... it looked like him.... I've got photos of him...."
Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity.
I know it sounds crazy," said Harry flatly. He turned to took at
Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently
searching
for worms. But he wasn't really watching Buckbeak.
He was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldest
friends... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.... Had all four of them
been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening
when everyone had thought he was dead.... Was it so impossible his
father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? The
figure had been too far away to see distinctly... yet he had felt sure,
for a moment, before he'd lost consciousness....
The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in
and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face
turned toward the Willow, waiting.
And then, at last, after over an hour...
"Here we come!" Hermione whispered.
She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw
Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the
roots. Then came Hermione... then the unconscious Snape, drifting
weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk
toward
the castle.
Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky.
Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the
moon....
"Harry," Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was
thinking, "we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we
can do...."
"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry
quietly.
"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?" snapped Hermione.
"There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're not
supposed to be doing anything else!"
"All right!"
The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures
across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement --
"There goes Lupin," Hermione whispered. "He's transforming
"Hermione!" said Harry suddenly. "We've got to move!"
"We mustn't, I keep telling you --"
"Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!"
Hermione gasped.
"Quick!" she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. "Quick! Where are we
going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming
any moment --"
"Back to Hagrid's!" Harry said. "It's empty now -- come on!"
They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them.
They could hear the werewolf howling behind them....
The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and
Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after
them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.
"Shh, Fang, it's us!" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his
ears to quieten him. "That was really close!" she said to Harry.
"Yeah..."
Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was
going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back
inside Hagrid's house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his
wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.
"I think I'd better go outside again, you know," said Harry slowly. "I
can't see what's going on -- we won't know when it's time --"
Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.
"I'm not going to try and interfere," said Harry quickly. "But if we
don't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time to
rescue Sirius?"
"Well... okay, then... I'll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be
careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors
Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear
yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on
Sirius.... He and Hermione would be running to him any moment....
Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in
his chest.... Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any
moment....
For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid's
door. You must not be seen. But he didn't want to be seen. He wanted to
do the seeing.... He had to know...
And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness
from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake.... They were
moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.... He
wouldn't
have to get near them....
Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father...
If it was him... if it really was him... he had to know, had to find
out....
The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody.
On the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver -- his own
attempts at a Patronus --
There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself
behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank,
the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified
excitement shot through him -- any moment now --
"Come on!" he muttered, staring about. "Where are you? Dad, come on --"
But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of
dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was
time for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this
time --
And then it hit him -- he understood. He hadn't seen his father -- he
had seen himself --
Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.
"EXPECTO PATRONUM! "he yelled.
And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but
a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to
see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away
from him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head
and charge at the swarming dementors.... Now it was galloping around and
around the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling
back, scattering, retreating into the darkness.... They were gone.
The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still
surface of the water. It wasn't a horse. It wasn't a unicorn, either. It
was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming
back to him....
It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it
stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its
antlered head. And Harry realized... "Prongs, "he whispered.
But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it
vanished.
Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of
his heart, he heard hooves behind him -he whirled around and saw
Hermione dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.
"What did you do?" she said fiercely. "You said you were only going to
keep a lookout!"
"I just saved all our lives...," said Harry. "Get behind here -- behind
this bush -- I'll explain."
Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet
again.
"Did anyone see you?"
"Yes, haven't you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad!
It's okay!"
"Harry, I can't believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove
away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic. I knew I
could do it this time," said Harry, "because I'd already done it....
Does that make sense?"
"I don't know -- Harry, look at Snape!"
Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had
regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp
forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no
doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out
in front of him, he moved them away toward the castle.
"Right, it's nearly time," said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch.
"We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to
the hospital wing. We've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward
before anybody realizes we're missing.... 11
They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the
bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was
ferreting for worms again.
"D' you reckon he's up there yet?" said Harry, checking his watch. He
looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of
the West Tower.
"Look!" Hermione whispered. that? Someone's coming back out
of
the castle!"
Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the
grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his
belt.
"Macnair!" said Harry. "The executioner! He's gone to get the dementors!
This is it, Hermione --"
Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak's back and Harry gave her a leg up.
Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and
climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak's rope back over his neck
and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins.
"Ready?" he whispered to Hermione. "YotM better hold on to me --
He nudged Buckbeak's sides with his heels.
Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks
with his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them.
Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could hear
her muttering, "Oh, no -- I don't like this oh, I really don't like this
--"
Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the
upper
floors of the castle.... Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the
rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows
flashing past --
"Whoa!" he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.
Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you
counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the
hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne.
"He's there!" Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the
window. He reached out, and as Buckbeak's wings fell, was able to tap
sharply on the glass.
Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair,
hurried to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked.
"Stand back!" Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still
gripping the back of Harry's robes with her left hand.
"Alohomora!"
The window sprang open.
"How -- how --?" said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff
"Get on -- there's not much time," said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly
on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. "You've got to get
out of here -the dementors are coming -- Macnair's gone to get them."
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his
head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In
seconds, he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak's back and pull
himself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione.
"Okay, Buckbeak, up!" said Harry, shaking the rope. "Up to the tower --
come on.
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring
upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a
clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.
"Sirius, you'd better go, quick," Harry panted. "They'll reach
Flitwick's office any moment, they'll find out you're gone."
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.
"What happened to the other boy? Ron?" croaked Sirius.
"He's going to be okay. He's still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says
she'll be able to make him better. Quick -- go --"
But Black was still staring down at Harry.
"How can I ever thank --"
"GO!" Harry and Hermione shouted together.
Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.
"We'll see each other again," he said. "You are -- truly your father's
son, Harry...."
He squeezed Buckbeak's sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped
back as the enormous wings rose once more.... The hippogriff took off
into the air.... He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry
gazed after them... then a cloud drifted across the moon.... They were
gone.
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
OWL POST AGAIN
Harry!"
Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch. "We've got
exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without
anybody seeing us -- before Dumbledore locks the door --"
"Okay," said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, "let's go...."
They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly
spiraling stone staircase. As they reached the bottom of it, they heard
voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It
sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the
corridor at the foot of the staircase.
"... only hope Dumbledore's not going to make difficulties," Snape was
saying. "The Kiss will be performed immediately?"
"As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair
has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm looking
forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him at last.... I
daresay they'll want to interview you, Snape... and once young Harry's
back in his right mind, I expect he'll want to tell the Prophet exactly
how you saved him...."
Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape's smirk as he and
Fudge passed Harry and Hermione's hiding place. Their footsteps died
away. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they'd
really
gone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one staircase,
then another, along a new ,corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead.
"Peeves!" Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione's wrist. "In here!"
They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves
seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits,
laughing his head off.
"Oh, he's horrible," whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. "I bet
he's all excited because the dementors are going to finish off
Sirius...." She checked her watch. "Three minutes, Harry!"
They waited until Peeves's gloating voice had faded into the distance,
then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.
"Hermione -- what'll happen -- if we don't get back inside before
Dumbledore locks the door?" Harry panted.
I don't want to think about it!" Hermione moaned, checking her watch
again. "One minute!"
They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing
entrance. "Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore," said Hermione tensely. "Come
on, Harry!"
They crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore's back
appeared.
"I am going to lock you in," they heard him saying. "it is five minutes
to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do It. Good luck."
Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his
wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward.
Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver
mustache. "Well?" he said quietly.
"We did it!" said Harry breathlessly. "Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak...."
Dumbledore beamed at them.
"Well done. I think --" He listened intently for any sound within the
hospital wing. "Yes, I think you've gone too -- get inside -- I'll lock
you in --"
Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty
except for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As the
lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their own
beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A moment
later, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office.
"Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my
patients now?"
She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept
their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure
they
ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting,
listening, their nerves jangling.... And then, as they both took a
fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar
of fury echoing from somewhere above them....
"What was that?" said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.
Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam
Pomfrey was staring at the door.
"Really -- they'll wake everybody up! What do they think they're doing?"
Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing
nearer --
"He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in
the
room with him. When this gets out --"
"HE DIDN'T DISAPPARATE!" Snape roared, now very close at hand.
"YOU
CAN'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS
-- HAS --
SOMETHING -- TO -- DO -- WITH -- POTTER!"
"Severus -- be reasonable -- Harry has been locked up --"
BAM.
The door of the hospital wing burst open.
Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore
alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying
himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.
"OUT WITH IT, POTTER!" he bellowed. "WHAT DID YOU DO?"
"Professor Snape!" shrieked Madam Pomfrey. "Control yourself!"
"See here, Snape, be reasonable," said Fudge. "This door's been locked,
we just saw --"
"THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!" Snape howled, pointing
at Harry and
Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
"Calm down, man!" Fudge barked. "You're talking nonsense!"
"YOU DON'T KNOW POTTER!" shrieked Snape. "HE DID IT, I KNOW
HE DID IT
--"
"That will do, Severus," said Dumbledore quietly. "Think about what you
are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes
ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?"
"Of course not!" said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. "I would have heard
them!"
"Well, there you have it, Severus," said Dumbledore calmly. "Unless you
are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at
once, I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further."
Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly
shocked at his behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling
behind
his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed
out of the ward.
"Fellow seems quite unbalanced," said Fudge, staring after him. "I'd
watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore."
"Oh, he's not unbalanced," said Dumbledore quietly. "He's just suffered
a severe disappointment."
"He's not the only one!" puffed Fudge. "The Daily Prophet's going to
have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our
fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that
hippogriff's escape to get out, and I'll be a laughingstock! Well... I'd
better go and notify the Ministry.....
"And the dementors?" said Dumbledore. "They'll be removed from the
school, I trust?"
"Oh yes, they'll have to go," said Fudge, running his fingers
distractedly through his hair. "Never dreamed they'd attempt to
administer the Kiss on an innocent boy... Completely out of control...
no, I'll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight.... Perhaps we
should think about dragons at the school entrance...."
"Hagrid would like that," said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and
Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to
the door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she headed
back to her office.
There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up.
They could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around.
"What -- what happened?" he groaned. "Harry? Why are we in here?
Where's
Sirius? Where's Lupin? What's going on?"
Harry and Hermione looked at each other.
"You explain," said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next
day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering, heat and
the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of
another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going,
however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking
about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where
Sirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant
squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread
of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag
had galloped toward him from there just last night....
A shadow fell across them and they looked 'tip to see a very bleary-eyed
Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth-sized
handkerchiefs and beaming down at them.
"Know I shouldn' feel happy, after wha' happened las' night," he said.
"I mean, Black escapin' again, an, everythin' -- but guess what?"
"What?" they said, pretending to look curious.
"Beaky! He escaped! He's free! Bin celebratin' all night!"
"That's wonderful!" said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because
he looked as though he was close to laughing.
"Yeah... can't've tied him up properly," said Hagrid, gazing happily out
over the grounds. "I was worried this mornin', mind... thought he mighta
met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin'
las' night...."
"What?" said Harry quickly.
"Blimey, haven' yeh heard?" said Hagrid, his smile fading a little. He
lowered his voice, even though there was nobody in sight. "Er -- Snape
told all the Slytherins this mornin'.... Thought everyone'd know by
now... Professor Lupin's a werewolf, see. An' he was loose on the
grounds las' night.... He's packin' now, o' course.
"He's packing?" said Harry, alarmed. "Why?"
"Leavin', isn' he?" said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to
ask. "Resigned firs' thing this mornin'. Says he can't risk it happenin
again.
Harry scrambled to his feet.
"I'm going to see him," he said to Ron and Hermione.
"But if he's resigned --"
"-- doesn't sound like there's anything we can do --"
"I don't care. I still want to see him. I'll meet you back here."
Lupin's office door was open. He had already packed most of his things.
The grindylow's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase,
which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his
desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door.
"I saw you coming," said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he
had been poring over. It was the Marauder's Map.
"I just saw Hagrid," said Harry. "And he said you'd resigned. It's not
true, is it?"
"I'm afraid it is," said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and
taking out the contents.
"Why?" said Harry. "The Ministry of Magic don't think you were helping
Sirius, do they?"
Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.
"No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying
to
save your lives." He sighed. "That was the final straw for Severus. I
think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he -- er --
accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast."
"You're not leaving just because of that!" said Harry.
Lupin smiled wryly.
"This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents.... They
will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last
night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you.... That must
never happen again."
"You're the best Defense Against the Dark Arts- teacher we've ever had!"
said Harry. "Don't go!"
Lupin shook his head and didn't speak. He carried on emptying his
drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to
make him stay, Lupin said, "From what the headmaster told me this
morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. if I'm proud of
anything I've done this year, it's how much you've learned.... Tell me
about your Patronus."
"How d'you know about that?" said Harry, distracted.
"What else could have driven the dementors back?"
Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he'd finished, Lupin was
smiling again.
"Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed," he said. "You
guessed right... that's why we called him Prongs."
Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers,
and turned to look at Harry.
"Here -- I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night," he said,
handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak. "And..." He hesitated, then
held out the Marauder's Map too. "I am no longer your teacher, so I
don't feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It's no use to me,
and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it."
Harry took the map and grinned.
"You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would've wanted to
lure me out of school... you said they'd have thought it was funny."
"And so we would have," said Lupin, now reaching down to close his
case.
"I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly
disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out
of the castle."
There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder's Map
and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket.
It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn't look surprised to see Harry
there.
"Your carriage is at the gates, Remus," he said.
"Thank You, Headmaster."
Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank.
"Well -- good-bye, Harry," he said, smiling. "It has been a real
pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage...."
Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as
possible.
"Good-bye, then, Remus," said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin shifted the
grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands.
Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the
office.
Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He
heard the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there.
"Why so miserable, Harry?" he said quietly. "You should be very proud of
yourself after last night."
"It didn't make any difference," said Harry bitterly. "Pettigrew got
away."
"Didn't make any difference?" said Dumbledore quietly, "It made all the
difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved
an innocent man from a terrible fate."
Terrible. Something stirred in Harry's memory. Greater and more terrible
than ever before... Professor Trelawney's prediction!
"Professor Dumbledore -- yesterday, when I was having my Divination
exam, Professor Trelawney went very -- very strange."
"Indeed?" said Dumbledore. "Er -- stranger than usual, you mean?"
"Yes... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said ... she
said Voldemort's servant was going to set out to return to him before
midnight.... She said the servant would help him come back to power."
Harry stared up at Dumbledore. "And then she sort of became normal
again, and she couldn't remember anything she'd said. Was it -- was she
making a real prediction?"
Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.
"Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been." he said thoughtfully.
"Who'd have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to
two. I should offer her a pay raise...."
"But --" Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so
calmly?
"But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew!
That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!"
"It does not," said Dumbledore quietly. "Hasn't your experience with the
Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions
are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a
very difficult business indeed.... Professor Trelawney, bless her, is
living proof of that.... You did a very noble thing, in saving
Pettigrew's life."
"But if he helps Voldemort back to power
"Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is
in your debt.... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates
a certain bond between them... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants
his servant in the debt of Harry Potter."
"I don't want a connection with Pettigrew!" said Harry. "He betrayed my
parents!"
"This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust
me... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's
life."
Harry couldn't imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though
he knew what Harry was thinking.
"I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry," he
said gently. "He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it."
Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn't laugh -- he could tell
Dumbledore...
"I thought it was my dad who'd conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw
myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him." "An easy mistake
to make," said Dumbledore softly. "I expect you'll tire of hearing it,
but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes... you
have your mother's eyes.
Harry shook his head.
"It was stupid, thinking it was him," he muttered. "I mean, I knew he
was dead."
"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we
don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your
father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you
have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus?
Prongs rode again last night."
It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said.
Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi," said
Dumbledore, smiling. "An extraordinary achievement -- not least, keeping
it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your
Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match
against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father
last night.... You found him inside yourself."
And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused
thoughts.
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night
that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron,
Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached,
Harry
heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none
of them came close to the truth.
Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had
found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged
that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy
Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius's escape.
"If I manage to get into the Ministry, I'll have a lot of proposals to
make about Magical Law Enforcement!" he told the only person who
would
listen -- his girlfriend, Penelope.
Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so
cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in
helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a
school year in worse spirits.
He certainly wasn't the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin
go. The whole of Harry's Defense Against the Dark Arts class was
miserable about his resignation.
"Wonder what they'll give us next year?" said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.
"Maybe a vampire," suggested Dean Thomas hopefully.
It wasn't only Professor Lupin's departure that was weighing on Harry's
mind. He couldn't help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney's
prediction. He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had
sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was lowering
Harry's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the
Dursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed
he would be living with Sirius from now on... his parents' best
friend.... It would have been the next best thing to having his own
father back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news,
because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn't
help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had,
and the fact that it was now impossible.
The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione had passed every subject. Harry was amazed that he had got
through Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have
stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape's behavior toward
Harry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn't have
thought it possible that Snape's dislike for him could increase, but it
certainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape's
thin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing
his fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry's throat.
Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and George had scraped a
handful of O.W.L.s each. Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to
their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the House
championship for the third year running. This meant that the end of term
feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that the
Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated.
Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the
next day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next mornIng,
Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news.
"I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast.
I've decided to drop Muggle Studies."
"But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!" said
Ron.
"I know," sighed Hermione, "but I can't stand another year like this
one. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I've handed it in. Without
Muggle Studies and Divination, I'll be able to have a normal schedule
again."
I still can't believe you didn't tell us about it," said Ron grumpily.
"We're supposed to be your friends."
"I promised I wouldn't tell anyone," said Hermione severely. She looked
around at Harry, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind
a
mountain. Two whole months before he'd see it again....
"Oh, cheer up, Harry!" said Hermione sadly.
"I'm okay," said Harry quickly. "Just thinking about the holidays."
"Yeah, I've been thinking about them too," said Ron. "Harry, you've got
to come and stay with us. I'll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I'll
call you. I know how to use a fellytone now --"
"A telephone, Ron," said Hermione. "Honestly, you should take Muggle
Studies next year...."
Ron her.
"It's the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come
and
stay, and we'll go and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work."
This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal.
"Yeah... I bet the Dursleys'd be pleased to let me come... especially
after what I did to Aunt Marge...."
Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in
several games of Exploding Snap, and when the witch with the tea cart
arrived, he bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing with
chocolate in it.
But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly
happy turned up....
"Harry," said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. "What's that
thing outside your window?"
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and
saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for
it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the
air, buffeted this way and that in the train's slipstream. Harry quickly
pulled down the window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt
like a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside. The owl
dropped its letter onto Harry's seat and began zooming around their
compartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its
task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval.
Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yellow
eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm's way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, "It's from Sirius!"
"What?" said Ron and Hermione excitedly. "Read it aloud!"
Dear Harry,
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don't know
whether they're used to owl post.
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won't tell you where, in case this owl
falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but
he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven't a
hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse
me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle
will be lifted.
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief
meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt --
"Ha!" said Hermione triumphantly. "See! I told you it was from him!"
"Yes, but he hadn't jinxed it, had he?" said Ron. "Ouch!" The tiny owl,
now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what
it seemed to think was an affectionate way.
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name
but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please
consider it as thirteen birthdays' worth of presents from your
godfather.
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that
night last year when you left your uncle's house. I had only hoped to
get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the
sight of me alarmed you.
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next
year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.
If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.
I'll write again soon.
Sirius
Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of
parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm
and contented as though he'd swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one
gulp.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter's godfather, hereby give him permission to
visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
"That'll be good enough for Dumbledore!" said Harry happily. He looked
back at Sirius's letter. "Hang on, there's a RS...."
I thought your ftiend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it's my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron's eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. "Keep
him?" he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a moment;
then, to Harry's and Hermione's great surprise, he held him out for
Crookshanks to sniff.
"What do you reckon?" Ron asked the cat. "Definitely an owl?"
Crookshanks purred.
"That's good enough for me," said Ron happily. "He's mine."
Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into
King's Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he,
Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine an('
three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a
good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and
when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about
them seemed confirmed.
"I'll call about the World Cup!" Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig's cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual
fashion.
"What's that?" he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still
clutching in his hand. "If it's another form for me to sign, you've got
another ---"
"It's not," said Harry cheerfully. "It's a letter from my godfather."
"Godfather?" sputtered Uncle Vernon. "You haven't got a godfather!"
"Yes, I have," said Harry brightly. "He was my mum and dad's best
friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison
and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep
up with my news... check if I'm happy..."
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face,
Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of
him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last.

CHAPTER ONE - THE RIDDLE HOUSE
The villagers of Little Hangleron still called it "the Riddle House," even
though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood
on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing
from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking
manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle
House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.
The Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was "creepy." Half a
century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that
the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip
were scarce. The story had been picked over so many times, and had been
embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was
anymore. Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty
years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House
had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to
find all three Riddles dead.
The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as
many people as she could.
"Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their dinner
things!"
The police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had
seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement. Nobody wasted
their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been
most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and
rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the
villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three
apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same
night.
The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the
whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They were
rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles' cook arrived dramatically
in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank
Bryce had just been arrested.
"Frank!" cried several people. "Never!"
Frank Bryce was the Riddles' gardener. He lived alone in a run-down
cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war
with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been
working for the Riddles ever since.
There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.
"Always thought he was odd," she told the eagerly listening villagers,
after her fourth sherry. "Unfriendly, like. I'm sure if I've offered him a cuppa
once, I've offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn't."
"Ah, now," said a woman at the bar, "he had a hard war, Frank. He likes
the quiet life. That's no reason to --"
"Who else had a key to the back door, then?" barked the cook. "There's
been a spare key hanging in the gardener's cottage far back as I can remember!
Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do
was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping..."
The villagers exchanged dark looks.
"I always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough,"
grunted a man at the bar.
"War turned him funny, if you ask me," said the landlord.
"Told you I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn't I,
Dot?" said an excited woman in the corner.
"Horrible temper," said Dot, nodding fervently. "I remember, when he
was a kid..."
By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that
Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.
But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and
dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he
was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of
the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.
Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure
Frank had invented him.
Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on
the Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything.
The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had
examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been
poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell)
harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable
bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the
fact that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find
something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror
upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three
people being frightened to death?
As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the
police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little
Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a
while. To everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce
returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.
"'S far as I'm concerned, he killed them, and I don't care what the police
say," said Dot in the Hanged Man. "And if he had any decency, he'd leave here,
knowing as how we knows he did it."
But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family
who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next -- for neither family stayed
long. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was
a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to
fall into disrepair.
The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived
there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for "tax
reasons," though nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy
owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing
his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but
could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the
weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.
Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys
from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the
Riddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to
keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They
knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost
to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden,
brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed
the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents,
though him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw
something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had
gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.
It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever
in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea
of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the
sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights
glimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The
boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of
the light, they had started a fire.
Frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police
ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths. He
put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would
allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old
key from its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was
propped against the wall, and set off into the night.
The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did
any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he
reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into
the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.
He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for
many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the
door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the
smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead.
He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned
windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing
the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet
and stick.
On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders
were: At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light
shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor.
Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room
beyond.
The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then
he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the
room; it sounded timid and fearful.
"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry."
"Later," said a second voice. This too belonged to a man -- but it was
strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something
about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up.
"Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail."
Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came
the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull
scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a
glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He
was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his
head. Then he went out of sight again.
"Where is Nagini?" said the cold voice.
"I -- I don't know, My Lord," said the first voice nervously. "She set out
to explore the house, I think..."
"You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail," said the second voice. "I
will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly."
Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door,
listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail
spoke again.
"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?"
"A week," said the cold voice. "Perhapse longer. The place is moderately
comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before
the Quidditch World Cup is over."
Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no
doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word "Quidditch," which was
not a word at all.
"The -- the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?" said Wormtail. (Frank dug
his finger still more vigorously into his ear.) "Forgive me, but -- I do not
understand -- why should we wait until the World Cup is over?"
"Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country
from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be
on duty, on the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and doublechecking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles
notice anything. So we wait."
Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the
words "Ministry of Magic," "wizards," and "Muggles." Plainly, each of these
expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of
people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold
on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.
"Your Lordship is still determined, then?" Wormtail said quietly.
"Certainly I am determined, Wormtail." There was a note of menace in
the cold voice now.
A slight pause followed -- and the Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling
from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost
his nerve.
"It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord."
Another pause, more protracted, and then --
"Without Harry Potter?" breathed the second voice softly. "I see..."
"My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!" said Wormtail,
his voice rising squeakily. "The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all! It is
merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard -- any wizard -- the thing
could be done so much more quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a
short while -- you know that I can disguise myself most effectively -- I could be
back here in as little as two days with a suitable person --"
"I could use another wizard," said the cold voice softly, "that is true..."
"My Lord, it makes sense," said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved
now. "Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well
protected --"
"And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I
wonder...perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you,
Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than
an attempt to desert me?"
"My Lord! I -- I have no wish to leave you, none at all --"
"Do not lie to me!" hissed the second voice. "I can always tell,
Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you. I see
you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me..."
"No! My devotion to Your Lordship --"
"Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here
if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need
feeding every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?"
"But you seem so much stronger, My Lord --"
"Liar," breathed the second voice. "I am no stronger, and a few days
alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your
clumsy care. Silence!"
Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a
few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. The the second
man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.
"I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you,
and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will
make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my
plan will be effective. All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail -
- courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord
Voldermort's wrath --"
"My Lord, I must speak!" said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. "All
through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head -- My Lord, Bertha
Jorkin's disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I
murder --"
"If?" whispered the second voice. "If? If you follow the plan, Wormtail,
the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly
and without fuss; I only wish that i could do it myself, but in my present
condition...Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is
clear. I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful serant will
have rejoined us --"
"I am a faithful servant," said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in
his voice.
"Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has
never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement."
"I found you," said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his
voice now. "I was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins."
"That is true," said the second man, sounding amused. "A stroke of
brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail -- though, if
truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught
her, were you?"
"I -- I thought she might be useful, My Lord --"
"Liar," said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more
pronounced than ever. "However, I do not deny that her information was
invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you
will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task
for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to
perform..."
"R-really, My Lord? What -- ?" Wormtail sounded terrified again.
"Ah, Wormtail, you don't want me to spoil the surprise? Your part will
come at the very end...but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just
as useful as Bertha Jorkins."
"You...you..." Wormtail's voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his
mouth had gone very dry. "You...are going...to kill me too?"
"Wormtail, Wormtail," said the cold voice silkily, "why would I kill you?
I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning,
quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she
had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her
holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into
Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns..."
Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but
it made the second man laugh -- an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.
"We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be
broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an
insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her,
Wormtail."
Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping
his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had
killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse -- with
amusement. He was dangerous -- a madman. And he was planning more
murders -- this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was -- was in danger --
Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the
police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box
in the village...but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained
where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.
"One more murder...my faithful servant at Hogwarts...Harry Potter is as
good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But
quiet...I think I hear Nagini..."
And the second man's voice changed. He started making noises such as
Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing
breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.
And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He
turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.
Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as
it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it
was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank
stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on
the floor, coming closer and closer -- What was he to do? The only means of
escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder, yet if he
stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him --
But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and
then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting,
hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of
its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.
There was sweat on Frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking
stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and
Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea...This man could talk to
snakes.
Frank didn't understand what was going on. He wanted more than
anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem was that
his legs didn't seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking and trying to
master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.
"Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail," it said.
"In-indeed, My Lord?" said Wormtail.
"Indeed, yes," said the voice, "According to Nagini, there is an old
Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say."
Frank didn't have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps and then
the door of the room was flung wide open.
A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery
eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face.
"Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?"
The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but
Frank couldn't see the speaker. the snake, on the other hand, was curled up on
the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.
Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken,
Frank took a firmer grip on his walking stick and limped over the threshold.
The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery
shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man
inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn't even see
the back of his head.
"You heard everything, Muggle?" said the cold voice.
"What's that you're calling me?" said Frank defiantly, for now that he was
inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt
braver; it had always been so in the war.
"I am calling you a Muggle," said the voice coolly. "It means that you are
not a wizard."
"I don't know what you mean by wizard," said Frank, his voice growing
steadier. "All I know is I've heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have.
You've done murder and you're planning more! And I'll tell youthis too," he
added, on a sudden inspiration, "my wife knows I'm up here, and if I don't come
back --"
"You have no wife," said te cold voice, very quietly. "Nobody knows you
are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord
Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows...he always knows..."
"Is that right?" said Frank roughly. "Lord, is it? Well, I don't think
much of your manners, My Lord. Turn 'round and face me like a man, why
don't you?"
"But I am not a man, Muggle," said the cold voice, barely audible now
over the crackling of the flames. "I am much, much more than a man.
However...why not? I will face you...Wormtail, come turn my chair around."
The servant gave a whimper.
"You heard me, Wormtail."
Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done
anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the
small man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The snake lifted its
ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its
rug.
And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it.
His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let
out a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the
thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a
rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.
Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.
CHAPTER TWO - THE SCAR
Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running.
He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The
old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning
beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his
skin.
He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the
darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and
his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was
filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.
Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned
on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his
wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of
fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy
black hair. He examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely.
It looked normal, but it was still stinging.
harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had
awoken. It had seemed so real...There had been two people he knew and one he
didn't ...He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember...
The dim picture of a darkened room came to him...There had been a
snake on a hearth rug...a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail...and a
cold, high voice...the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt as though an ice cube
had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought...
He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had
looked like, but it was impossible...All Harry knew was that at the moment
when Voldemort's chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen what was
sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken him...or had that
been the pain in his scar?
And who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an old
man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused.
Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to
the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his
cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on
to them...Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had
killed, though Harry could not remember the name...and they had been plotting
to kill someone else...him!
Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around
his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there. As it
happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room. A
large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron,
broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered
that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his
snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a book lay
open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures in
this book were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and
out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.
Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched on of the
wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high
hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch -- in Harry's opinion,
the best sport in the world -- couldn't distract him at the moment. He placed
Flying with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew
back the curtains to survey the street below.
Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be
expected to look inthe early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were
closed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn't a living
creature in sight, not even a cat.
And yet...and yet...Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on
it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn't the pain that bothered him;
Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from his
right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had
been pierced by a venemous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year
Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick. He was used to bizarre
accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.
No, the thing that was bothering Harry was the last time his scar had hurt
him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by...But Voldemort couldn't
be here, now...The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd,
impossible...
Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half expecting to
hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as
he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next
room.
Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was no one in
the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they
were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.
Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn't as though
they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and
Dudley were Harry's only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated and
despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in
their house as dry rot. They had explained away Harry's long absences at
Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St.
Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well
that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn't allowed to use magic outside
Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong
about the house. Harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them
anything about his life in the wizarding world. The very idea of going to them
when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his
worries about Voldemort, was laughable.
And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the
Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would not
have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn't been for Voldemort,
Harry would still have had parents...
Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort -- the most powerful
Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for
eleven years -- arrived at his house and killed his father and mother. Voldemort
had then turned his wand on Harry; he had performed the curse that had
disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power --
and, incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the curse
had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing but a
lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to
something barely alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished,
Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and
wizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort's followers had disbanded,
and Harry Potter had become famous.
It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh
birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out
that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name. Harry had arrived
at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he
went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be
starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days
until he would be back at the castle again.
But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school. He
looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday
cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July. What would they say
if Harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting?
At once, Hermione Granger's voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and
panicky.
"Your scar hurt? Harry, that's really serious.... Write to Professor
Dumbledore! And I'll go and check Common Magical Ailments and
Afflictions.... Maybe there's something in there about curse scars. . . ."
Yes, that would be Hermione's advice: Go straight to the headmaster of
Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of the
window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book
could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have
survived a curse like Voldemort's; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he
would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.
As for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went
during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing
Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full length wizard's robes, and pointed
hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long
crooked nose. Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig
would be able to find him; Harry's owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to
anyone, even without an address. But what would he write?
Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this
morning. Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.
Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.
And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley's, reaction,
and in a moment, Ron's red hair and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim
before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.
"Your scar hurt? But ... but You-Know-Who can't be near you now, can
he? I mean ... you'd know, wouldn't you? He'd be trying to do you in again,
wouldn't be? I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit... I'll ask
Dad. . . ."
Mr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of
Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn't have any
particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew. In any case,
Harry didn't like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry,
was getting jumpy about a few moments' pain. Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse
than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron's sixteen- year-old twin brothers,
might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys were Harry's favorite
family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time
now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he
somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.
Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted
(and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like —
someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without
feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with
Dark Magic....
And then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that
he couldn't believe it had taken so long — Sirius.
Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his
desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill
with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his
problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of Sirius straight
away. But then, perhaps it wasn't so surprising — after all, he had only found
out that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.
There was a simple reason for Sirius's complete absence from Harry's life
until then — Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by
creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking fiends who had come to
search for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been
innocent — the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed
by Wormtail, Voldemort's supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed
dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had come
face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor
Dumbledore had believed their story.
For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the
Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been
cleared. But the chance had been snatched away from him — Wormtail had
escaped before they could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had
to flee for his life. Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff
called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry
might have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all
summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had
so nearly escaped them forever.
Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn't be
with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his
bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general
wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his
powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs
every summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they had found
out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather — for Harry had
conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.
Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at
Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards),
but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig had not approved of these
flashy intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her
water tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them;
they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever
Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was
enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to imaging dementors
surviving for long in bright sunlight, perhapse that was why Sirius had gone
South. Sirius's letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose
floorboards under Harry's bed, sounded chearful, and in both of them he had
reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to right
now, all right...
Harry's lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes
sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his
bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard
from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's room, Harry cleared his desk of
crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.
Dear Sirius,
Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly get
through my window. Things are the same as usual here. Dudley's diet isn't
going too well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room
yesterday. They told him they'd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps
doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the
window. That's a sort of computer thing you can play games on. Bit stupid
really, now he hasn't even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind
off things.
I'm okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up
and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.
A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again. Last
time that happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don't
reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if curse
scars sometimes hurt years afterward?
I'll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she's off hunting at the
moment. Say hello to Buckbeak for me. Harry
Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point putting in the
dream; he didn't want it to look as though he was too worried. He folded up the
parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned. Then
he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. Without
glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to
breakfast.
CHAPTER THREE – THE INVITATION
By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were
already seated around the table. None of them looked up as he entered or sat
down. Uncle Vernon's large red face was hidden behind the morning's Daily
Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed
over her horselike teeth.
Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up
even more space than usual. This was saying something, as he always took up
an entire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt Petunia put a quarter
of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley's plate with a tremulous "There you are,
Diddy darling," Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant
turn since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year report.
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad
marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted
boy whose teachers didn't understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that
"he didn't want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway." They also
skated over the accusations of bullying in the report — "He's a boisterous little
boy, but he wouldn't hurt a fly!" Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.
However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments
from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could
explain away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was bigboned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing
boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn't
stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. The school nurse had seen
what Aunt Petunia's eyes — so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on
her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors
— simply refused to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had
reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.
So — after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry's bedroom floor,
and many tears from Aunt Petunia — the new regime had begun. The diet
sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the
fridge, which had been emptied of all Dudley's favorite things — fizzy drinks
and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and
vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called "rabbit food." To
make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole
family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He
noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's. Aunt Petunia seemed to feet that
the best way to keep up Dudley's morale was to make sure that he did, at least,
get more to eat than Harry.
But Aunt Petunia didn't know what was hidden under the loose floorboard
upstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all. The
moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer
on carrot sticks, Harry had sent Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and
they had risen to the occasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned from
Hermione's house with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks.
(Hermione's parents were dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had
obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry hadn't
touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid's cooking.) Mrs.
Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an enormous fruitcake
and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a
full five days to recover from the journey. And then on Harry's birthday (which
the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday
cakes, one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius. Harry still had two of
them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs,
he ate his grapefruit without complaint.
Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked
down at his own grapefruit quarter.
"Is this it?" he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.
Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at Dudley,
who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry's
with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.
Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy mustache, and
picked up his spoon.
The doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off
down the hall. Quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle,
Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon's grapefruit.
Harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and Uncle Vernon
answering curtly. Then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper
came from the hall.
Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to
see where Uncle Vernon had got to. She didn't have to wait long to find out;
after about a minute, he was back. He looked livid.
"You," he barked at Harry. "In the living room. Now."
Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time,
Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next
room. Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.
"So," he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as
though he were about to pronounce him under arrest. "So."
Harry would have dearly loved to have said, "So what?" but he didn't feel that
Uncle Vernon's temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially
when it was already under severe strain from lack of food. He therefore settled
for looking politely puzzled.
"This just arrived," said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of purple writing
paper at Harry. "A letter. About you."
Harry's confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about
him? Who did he know who sent letters by the postman?
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter and began to read
aloud:
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,
We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal
from Harry about my son Ron.
As Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes
place this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get
prime tickets through his connections at the Department of Magical Games
and Sports.
I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this really is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn't hosted the cup for thirty years,
and tickets are extremely hard to come by. We would of course be glad to
have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him
safely onto the train back to school.
It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in
the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our
house, and I am not sure he even knows where it is.
Hoping to see Harry soon,
Yours sincerely,
Molly Weasley
P.S. I do hope we've put enough stamps on.
Uncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket, and
drew out something else.
"Look at this," he growled.
He held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley's letter had come, and Harry
had to fight down a laugh. Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a
square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys'
address in minute writing.
"She did put enough stamps on, then," said Harry, trying to sound as though
Mrs. Weasley's was a mistake anyone could make. His uncle's eyes flashed.
"The postman noticed," he said through gritted teeth. "Very interested to know
where this letter came from, he was. That's why he rang the doorbell. Seemed
to think it was funny."
Harry didn't say anything. Other people might not understand why Uncle
Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the
Dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even
slightly out of the ordinary. Their worst fear was that someone would find out
that they were connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.
Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression
neutral. If he didn't do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of
a lifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to say something, but he merely
continued to glare. Harry decided to break the silence.
"So — can I go then?" he asked.
A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon's large purple face. The mustache
bristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a
furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon's most fundamental instincts came into
conflict. Allowing Harry to go would make Harry happy, something Uncle
Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing
Harry to disappear to the Weasleys' for the rest of the summer would get rid of
him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated
having Harry in the house. To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked
down at Mrs. Weasley's letter again.
"Who is this woman?" he said, staring at the signature with distaste.
“You've seen her," said Harry. "She's my friend Ron's mother, she was meeting
him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of last term."
He had almost said "Hogwarts Express," and that was a sure way to get his
uncle's temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry's school aloud in
the Dursley household.
Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember
something very unpleasant.
"Dumpy sort of woman?" he growled finally. "Load of children with red hair?"
Harry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone
"dumpy," when his own son, Dudley, had finally achieved what he'd been
threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than he was tall.
Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.
"Quidditch," he muttered under his breath. "Quidditch — what is this rubbish?"
Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.
"It's a sport," he said shortly. "Played on broom— "
"All right, all right!" said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry saw, with some
satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky. Apparently his nerves
couldn't stand the sound of the word "broomsticks" in his living room. He took
refuge in perusing the letter again. Harry saw his lips form the words "send us
your answer ... in the normal way." He scowled.
"What does she mean, 'the normal way'?" he spat.
"Normal for us," said Harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added,
"you know, owl post. That's what's normal for wizards."
Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting
swearword. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window, as
though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the
glass.
"How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under
my roof?" he hissed, his face now a rich plum color. "You stand there, in the
clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back —"
"Only after Dudley finished with them," said Harry coldly, and indeed, he was
dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves
five times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his
extremely baggy jeans.
“I will not be spoken to like that!" said Uncle Vernon, trembling with rage.
But Harry wasn't going to stand for this. Gone were the days when he had been
forced to take every single one of the Dursleys' stupid rules. He wasn't
following Dudley's diet, and he wasn't going to let Uncle Vernon stop him from
going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a deep,
steadying breath and then said, "Okay, I can't see the World Cup. Can I go
now, then? Only I've got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know — my
godfather."
He had done it, he had said the magic words. Now he watched the purple
recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon's face, making it look like badly mixed
black currant ice cream.
"You're — you're writing to him, are you?" said Uncle Vernon, in a would-be
calm voice — but Harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with
sudden fear.
"Well — yeah," said Harry, casually. "It's been a while since he heard from me,
and, you know, if he doesn't he might start thinking something's wrong."
He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words. He could almost see the
cogs working under Uncle Vernon's thick, dark, neatly parted hair. If he tried to
stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated. If
he told Harry he couldn't go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write
and tell Sirius, who would know Harry was being mistreated. There was only
one thing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion forming in
his uncle's mind as though the great mustached face were transparent. Harry
tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible. And then —
"Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy ... this stupid ... this World Cup
thing. You write and tell these — these Weasleys they're to pick you up, mind.
I haven't got time to go dropping you off all over the country. And you can
spend the rest of the summer there. And you can tell your — your godfather ...
tell him ... tell him you're going."
"Okay then," said Harry brightly.
He turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the urge to jump
into the air and whoop. He was going ... he was going to the Weasleys', he was
going to watch the Quidditch World Cup!
Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been lurking behind the
door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off. He looked shocked to see
the broad grin on Harry's face.
"That was an excellent breakfast, wasn't it?" said Harry. "I feel really full,
don't you?"
Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley's face, Harry took the stairs three at
a time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom.
The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting in her cage,
staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the
way that meant she was annoyed about something. Exactly what was annoying
her became apparent almost at once.
"OUCH!" said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball
collided with the side of his head. Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking
up to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the
palm of his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework.
Harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet. Harry bent
down, recognized Ron's handwriting, then tore open the envelope. Inside was a
hastily scribbled note.
Harry — DAD GOT THE TICKETS — Ireland versus Bulgaria, Monday
night. Mum's writing to the Muggles to ask you to stay. They might already
have the letter, I don't know how fast Muggle post is. Thought I'd send this
with Pig anyway.
Harry stared at the word "Pig," then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming
around the light fixture on the ceiling. He had never seen anything that looked
less like a pig. Maybe he couldn't read Ron's writing. He went back to the
letter:
We're coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you can't miss the
World Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon it's better if we pretend to ask their
permission first. If they say yes, send Pig back with your answer pronto, and
we'll come and get you at five o'clock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig
back pronto and we'll come and get you at five o'clock on Sunday anyway.
Hermione's arriving this afternoon. Percy's started work — the Department
of International Magical Cooperation. Don't mention anything about
Abroad while you're here unless you want the pants bored off you.
See you soon — Ron
"Calm down!" Harry said as the small owl flew low over his head, twittering
madly with what Harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the
letter to the right person. "Come here, I need you to take my answer back!"
The owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig's cage. Hedwig looked coldly up at
it, as though daring it to try and come any closer.
Harry seized his eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh piece of
parchment, and wrote:
Ron, it's all okay, the Muggles say I can come. See you five o'clock
tomorrow. Can't wait. Harry
He folded this note up very small, and with immense difficulty, tied it to the tiny
owl's leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement. The moment the note was
secure, the owl was off again; it zoomed out of the window and out of sight.
Harry turned to Hedwig.
"Feeling up to a long journey?" he asked her.
Hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way.
"Can you take this to Sirius for me?" he said, picking up his letter. "Hang on ...
I just want to finish it."
He unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript.
If you want to contact me, I'll be at my friend Ron Weasley's for the rest of the
summer. His dad's got us tickets for the Quidditch World Cup!
The letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig's leg; she kept unusually still, as though
determined to show him how a real post owl should behave.
"I'll be at Ron's when you get back, all right?" Harry told her.
She nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing noise, spread
her enormous wings and soared out of the open window.
Harry watched her out of sight, then crawled under his bed, wrenched up the
loose floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake. He sat there on
the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through him. He
had cake, and Dudley had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer's day,
he would be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar felt perfectly normal again,
and he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup. It was hard, just now, to
feel worried about anything — even Lord Voldemort.
CHAPTER FOUR – BACK TO THE BURROW
By twelve o'clock the next day, Harry's school trunk was packed with his school
things and all his most prized possessions — the Invisibility Cloak he had
inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius, the
enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley
last year. He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all
food, double-checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten
spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the
days to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days remaining
until his return to Hogwarts.
The atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely tense. The
imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the
Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked downright alarmed
when Harry informed him that the Weasleys would be arriving at five o'clock
the very next day.
"I hope you told them to dress properly, these people," he snarled at once. "I've
seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They'd better have the decency to put on
normal clothes, that's all."
Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or Mrs. Weasley
wearing anything that the Dursleys would call "normal." Their children might
don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually
wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness. Harry wasn't bothered about
what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious about how rude the
Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst
idea of wizards.
Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this might have looked
like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted
to look impressive and intimidating. Dudley, on the other hand, looked
somehow diminished. This was not because the diet was at last taking effect,
but due to fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully
grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and
Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private
hospital in London. It wasn't altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept
running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room
to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.
Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn't even protest at the food
(cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn't, eating anything at all.
Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her
tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.
"They'll be driving, of course?" Uncle Vernon barked across the table.
"Er," said Harry.
He hadn't thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick him up? They
didn't have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was
currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley
had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same
today?
"I think so," said Harry.
Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would have
asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how big
and expensive their cars were. But Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon
would have taken to Mr. Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.
Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn't stand watching
Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though
there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to
five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room.
Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle Vernon was
pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry was
sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching
car. Dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him,
clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry couldn't take the tension; he left the
room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his watch and his
heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.
But five o'clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring slightly in his
suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew his
head quickly.
"They're late!" he snarled at Harry.
I know," said Harry. "Maybe — er — the traffic's bad, or something."
Ten past five ... then a quarter past five ... Harry was starting to feel anxious
himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing
in terse mutters in the living room.
"No consideration at all."
"We might've had an engagement."
"Maybe they think they'll get invited to dinner if they're late."
"Well, they most certainly won't be," said Uncle Vernon, and Harry heard him
stand up and start pacing the living room. "They'll take the boy and go, there'll
be no hanging around. That's if they're coming at all. Probably mistaken the
day. I daresay their kind don't set much store by punctuality. Either that or
they drive some tin-pot car that's broken d— AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!"
Harry jumped up. From the other side of the living room door came the sounds
of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, across the room. Next
moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified.
"What happened?" said Harry. "What's the matter?"
But Dudley didn't seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over his buttocks, he
waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living room.
Loud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys' boardedup fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.
"What is it?" gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was
staring, terrified, toward the fire. "What is it, Vernon?"
But they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could be heard from
inside the blocked fireplace.
"Ouch! Fred, no — go back, go back, there's been some kind of mistake — tell
George not to — OUCH! George, no, there's no room, go back quickly and tell
Ron—"
"Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad — maybe he'll be able to let us out—"
There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire.
"Harry? Harry, can you hear us?"
The Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines.
"What is this?" growled Uncle Vernon. "What's going on?"
"They — they've tried to get here by Floo powder," said Harry, fighting a mad
desire to laugh. "They can travel by fire — only you've blocked the fireplace
— hang on —"
He approached the fireplace and called through the boards.
"Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me?"
The hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney piece said, "Shh!"
"Mr. Weasley, it's Harry ... the fireplace has been blocked up. You won't be
able to get through there."
"Damn!" said Mr. Weasley's voice. "What on earth did they want to block up
the fireplace for?"
"They've got an electric fire," Harry explained.
"Really?" said Mr. Weasley's voice excitedly. "Eclectic, you say? With a
plug? Gracious, I must see that.... Let's think ... ouch, Ron!"
Ron's voice now joined the others'.
"What are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?"
"Oh no, Ron," came Fred's voice, very sarcastically. "No, this is exactly where
we wanted to end up."
"Yeah, we're having the time of our lives here," said George, whose voice
sounded muffled, as though he was squashed against the wall.
"Boys, boys. . ." said Mr. Weasley vaguely. "I'm trying to think what to do....
Yes ... only way. . . Stand back, Harry."
Harry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved forward.
"Wait a moment!" he bellowed at the fire. "What exactly are you going to —"
BANG.
The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace burst outward,
expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose
chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table;
Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the
Weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who
were identical to the last freckle.
"That's better," panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes
and straightening his glasses. "Ah — you must be Harry's aunt and uncle!"
Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his hand outstretched,
but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia. Words
utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His best suit was covered in white dust, which had
settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged
thirty years.
"Er — yes — sorry about that," said Mr. Weasley, lowering his hand and
looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. "It's all my fault. It just
didn't occur to me that we wouldn't be able to get out at the other end. I had
your fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you see — just for an afternoon,
you know, so we could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren't supposed to be
connected, strictly speaking — but I've got a useful contact at the Floo
Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy, though,
don't worry. I'll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can repair your
fireplace before I Disapparate."
Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn't understood a single word of this.
They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia staggered
upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.
"Hello, Harry!" said Mr. Weasley brightly. "Got your trunk ready?"
"It's upstairs," said Harry, grinning back.
"We'll get it," said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and George left the
room. They knew where Harry's bedroom was, having once rescued him from
it in the dead of night. Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a
glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry.
"Well," said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find
words to break the very nasty silence. "Very — erm — very nice place you've
got here."
As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick,
this remark didn't go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon's face
purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again.
However, they seemed too scared to actually say anything.
Mr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do with Muggles.
Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video
recorder.
"They run off eckeltricity, do they?" he said knowledgeably. "Ah yes, I can see
the plugs. I collect plugs," he added to Uncle Vernon. "And batteries. Got a very
large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I'm mad, but there you are."
Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He moved ever so
slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought
Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.
Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of his
trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the
kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified
eyes, and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father.
Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon's bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia,
was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.
"Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?" said Mr. Weasley, taking another brave
stab at making conversation.
"Yep," said Harry, "that's Dudley."
He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other;
the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was
still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weasley,
however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley's peculiar behavior. Indeed,
from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr.
Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was,
except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.
"Having a good holiday, Dudley?" he said kindly.
Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive
backside.
Fred and George came back into the room carrying Harry's school trunk. They
glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into
identical evil grins.
"Ah, right," said Mr. Weasley. "Better get cracking then."
He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the
Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.
”Incendio!" said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind
him.
Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been
burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket,
untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which
turned emerald green and roared higher than ever.
"Off you go then, Fred," said Mr. Weasley.
"Coming," said Fred. "Oh no — hang on —"
A bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred's pocket and the contents were now
rolling in every direction — big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers.
Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the
Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying
"the Burrow!" Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp. There was a
whooshing sound, and Fred vanished.
"Right then, George," said Mr. Weasley, "you and the trunk."
Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its
end so that he could hold it better. Then, with a second whoosh, George had
cried "the Burrow!" and vanished too.
"Ron, you next," said Mr. Weasley.
"See you," said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned broadly at Harry, then
stepped into the fire, shouted "the Burrow!" and disappeared.
Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.
"Well . . . 'bye then," Harry said to the Dursleys.
They didn't say anything at all. Harry moved toward the fire, but just as he
reached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a hand and held him back.
He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement.
"Harry said good-bye to you," he said. "Didn't you hear him?"
"It doesn't matter," Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. "Honestly, I don't care."
Mr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry's shoulder.
"You aren't going to see your nephew till next summer," he said to Uncle
Vernon in mild indignation. "Surely you're going to say good-bye?"
Uncle Vernon's face worked furiously. The idea of being taught consideration
by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be
causing him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley's wand was still in his hand,
and Uncle Vernon's tiny eyes darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully,
"Good-bye, then."
"See you," said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames, which felt
pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment, however, a horrible gagging
sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to scream.
Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents. He
was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering on a
foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth. One
bewildered second later, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley's
tongue — and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him.
Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of
his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly,
Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle
Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to
shout to make himself heard.
"Not to worry, I can sort him out!" he yelled, advancing on Dudley with his
wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw
herself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr. Weasley.
"No, really!" said Mr. Weasley desperately. "It's a simple process it was the
toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it's only an Engorgement
Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct it —"
But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic- stricken; Aunt
Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley's tongue as though
determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined
pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control
completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very
hard at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the
blasted fireplace.
"Now really!" said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand. "I'm trying to
help!"
Bellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament.
"Harry, go! Just go!" Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle Vernon. "I'll
sort this out!"
Harry didn't want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon's second ornament
narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the
situation to Mr. Weasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as
he said "the Burrow!" His last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr.
Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon's hand with his wand,
Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley's tongue
lolling around like a great slimy python. But next moment Harry had begun to
spin very fast, and the Dursleys' living room was whipped out of sight in a rush
of emerald-green flames.
CHAPTER FIVE – WEASLEYS’ WIZARD WHEEZES
Harry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred
fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes.
Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and
came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the
Weasleys' kitchen fire.
"Did he eat it?" said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his fee
"Yeah," said Harry, straightening up. "What was it?"
"Ton-Tongue Toffee," said Fred brightly. "George and I invented them, and
we've been looking for someone to test them on all summer. . . ."
The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that
Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired
people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they
must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers.
"How're you doing, Harry?" said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and
holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under
his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania.
Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who
were both long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was
weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were
muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.
Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry's hand. Bill came as
something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank,
Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always
imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and
fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was — there was no other
word for it — cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a
ponytail. He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling
from it. Bill's clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert,
except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon
hide.
Before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise,
and Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at George's shoulder. He was looking
angrier than Harry had ever seen him.
"That wasn't funny Fred!" he shouted. "What on earth did you give that Muggle
boy?"
"I didn't give him anything," said Fred, with another evil grin. I just dropped
it.... It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told him to."
"You dropped it on purpose!" roared Mr. Weasley. "You knew he'd eat it, you
knew he was on a diet —"
"How big did his tongue get?" George asked eagerly.
"It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it!"
Harry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.
"It isn't funny!" Mr. Weasley shouted. "That sort of behavior seriously
undermines wizard-Muggle relations! I spend half my life campaigning against
the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons
"We didn't give it to him because he's a Muggle!" said Fred indignantly.
"No, we gave it to him because he's a great bullying git," said George. "Isn't he,
Harry?"
"Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley," said Harry earnestly.
"That's not the point!" raged Mr. Weasley. "You wait until I tell your mother
—"
"Tell me what?" said a voice behind them.
Mrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, plump woman with
a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion.
"Oh hello, Harry, dear," she said, spotting him and smiling. Then her eyes
snapped back to her husband. "Tell me what, Arthur?"
Mr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he was with Fred
and George, he hadn't really intended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had happened.
There was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife nervously. Then two
girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very
bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry's and Ron's friend,
Hermione Granger. The other, who was small and red-haired, was Ron's
younger sister, Ginny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned back, which
made Ginny go scarlet — she had been very taken with Harry ever since his
first visit to the Burrow.
"Tell me what, Arthur?" Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice.
"It's nothing, Molly," mumbled Mr. Weasley, "Fred and George just — but I've
had words with them —"
"What have they done this time?" said Mrs. Weasley. "If it's got anything to do
with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes —"
"Why don't you show Harry where he's sleeping, Ron?" said Hermione from the
doorway.
"He knows where he's sleeping," said Ron, "in my room, he slept there last —"
"We can all go," said Hermione pointedly.
"Oh," said Ron, cottoning on. "Right."
"Yeah, we'll come too," said George.
"You stay where you are!" snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off
along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through
the house to the upper stories.
"What are Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes?" Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn't.
"Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George's
room," said Ron quietly. "Great long price lists for stuff they've invented. Joke
stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I
never knew they'd been inventing all that . . ."
"We've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never
thought they were actually making things," said Ginny. "We thought they just
liked the noise."
"Only, most of the stuff — well, all of it, really — was a bit dangerous," said
Ron, "and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some
money, and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren't allowed to make
any more of it, and burned all the order forms.... She's furious at them anyway.
They didn't get as many O.W.L.s as she expected."
O.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts students
took at the age of fifteen.
"And then there was this big row," Ginny said, "because Mum wants them to go
into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do is
open a joke shop."
Just then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing
horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.
"Hi, Percy," said Harry.
"Oh hello, Harry," said Percy. "I was wondering who was making all the noise.
I'm trying to work in here, you know I've got a report to finish for the office —
and it's rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and
down the stairs."
"We're not thundering, "said Ron irritably. "We're walking. Sorry if we've
disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic."
"What are you working on?" said Harry.
"A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation," said Percy
smugly. "We're trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign
imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of
almost three percent a year —"
"That'll change the world, that report will," said Ron. "Front page of the Daily
Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks."
Percy went slightly pink.
"You might sneer, Ron," he said heatedly, "but unless some sort of international
law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow—
bottomed products that seriously endanger —"
"Yeah, yeah, all right," said Ron, and he started off upstairs again. Percy
slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed
Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to
them. It sounded as though Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the
toffees.
The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last
time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron's favorite Quidditch
team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping
ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog
spawn, now contained one extremely large frog. Ron's old rat, Scabbers, was
here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron's
letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and
twittering madly.
"Shut up, Pig," said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had
been squeezed into the room. "Fred and George are in here with us, because
Bill and Charlie are in their room," he told Harry. "Percy gets to keep his room
all to himself because he's got to work."
"Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?" Harry asked Ron.
"Because he's being stupid," said Ginny, "Its proper name is Pigwidgeon."
"Yeah, and that's not a stupid name at all," said Ron sarcastically. "Ginny
named him," he explained to Harry. "She reckons it's sweet. And I tried to
change it, but it was too late, he won't answer to anything else. So now he's Pig.
I've got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys
me too, come to that.
Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry knew Ron
too well to take him seriously. He had moaned continually about his old rat,
Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione's cat, Crookshanks,
appeared to have eaten him.
"Where's Crookshanks?" Harry asked Hermione now.
"Out in the garden, I expect," she said. "He likes chasing gnomes. He's never
seen any before."
"Percy's enjoying work, then?" said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds and
watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling.
"Enjoying it?" said Ron darkly. "I don't reckon he'd come home if Dad didn't
make him. He's obsessed. Just don't get him onto the subject of his boss.
According to Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Crouch is
of the opinion ... Mr. Crouch was telling me ... They'll be announcing their
engagement any day now."
"Have you had a good summer, Harry?" said Hermione. "Did you get our food
parcels and everything?"
"Yeah, thanks a lot, " said Harry. "They saved my life, those cakes.
"And have you heard from —?" Ron began, but at a look from Hermione he
fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and
Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the
Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry's godfather
as he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody
but themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped,
or believed in his innocence.
"I think they've stopped arguing," said Hermione, to cover the awkward
moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry. "Shall we
go down and help your mum with dinner?"
"Yeah, all right," said Ron. The four of them left Ron's room and went back
downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely badtempered.
"We're eating out in the garden," she said when they came in. "There's just not
room for eleven people in here. Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill
and Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and forks, please, you two," she
said to Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had
intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast
that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.
"Oh for heaven's sake," she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan,
which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping up
the potatoes. "Those two!" she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans
out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George. I don't know
what's going to happen to them, I really don't. No ambition, unless you count
making as much trouble as they possibly can...."
Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and
began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the
wand tip as she stirred.
"It's not as though they haven't got brains, she continued irritably, taking the
saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, "but
they're wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they'll be in
real trouble. I've had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put
together. If they carry on the way they're going, they'll end up in front of the
Improper Use of Magic Office."
Mrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open. Harry
and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew
across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped
back into the sink by the dustpan.
"I don't know where we went wrong with them," said Mrs. Weasley, putting
down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. "It's been the same
for years, one thing after another, and they won't listen to — OH NOT
AGAIN!"
She had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak
and turned into a giant rubber mouse.
"One of their fake wands again!" she shouted. "How many times have I told
them not to leave them lying around?"
She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove
was smoking.
"C'mon," Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the
open drawer, "let's go and help Bill and Charlie."
They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard.
They had only gone a few paces when Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat,
Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the
air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it
instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very
fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington
boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the gnome giggling
madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it.
Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the
house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden,
and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two
battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each
attempting to knock the other's out of the air. Fred and George were cheering,
Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently
torn between amusement and anxiety.
Bill's table caught Charlie's with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off.
There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy's head
poking out of a window on the second floor.
"Will you keep it down?!" he bellowed.
"Sorry, Perce," said Bill, grinning. "How're the cauldron bottoms coming on?"
"Very badly," said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut.
Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end,
and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and conjured
tablecloths from nowhere.
By seven o'clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs.
Weasley's excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were
settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody
who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was
paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to
chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.
At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report on
cauldron bottoms.
"I've told Mr. Crouch that I'll have it ready by Tuesday," Percy was saying
pompously. "That's a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of
things. I think he'll be grateful I've done it in good time, I mean, its extremely
busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the World
Cup. We're just not getting the support we need from the Department of
Magical Games and Sports. Ludo Bagman —"
"I like Ludo," said Mr. Weasley mildly. "He was the one who got us such good
tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot
of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I smoothed the whole
thing over."
"Oh Bagman's likable enough, of course," said Percy dismissively, "but how he
ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch! I
can't see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find
out what's happened to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for
over a month now? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?"
"Yes, I was asking Ludo about that," said Mr. Weasley, frowning. "He says
Bertha's gotten lost plenty of times before now — though must say, if it was
someone in my department, I'd be worried. . . ."
"Oh Bertha's hopeless, all right," said Percy. "I hear she's been shunted from
department to department for years, much more trouble than she's worth ... but
all the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her. Mr. Crouch has been
taking a personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you know,
and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but Bagman just keeps
laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia
instead of Albania. However" — Percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a
deep swig of elderflower wine — "we've got quite enough on our plates at the
Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find
members of other departments too. As you know, we've got another big event
to organize right after the World Cup."
Percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the
table where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting. "You know the one I'm
talking about, Father." He raised his voice slightly. "The top-secret one."
Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, "He's been trying to
get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work. Probably an
exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons."
In the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill about his
earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition.
". . . with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?"
"Mum,.no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home
plenty of treasure," said Bill patiently.
"And your hair's getting silly, dear," said Mrs. Weasley, fingering her wand
lovingly." I wish you'd let me give it a trim. . . ."
"I like it," said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. "You're so old-fashioned,
Mum. Anyway, it's nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore's...."
Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking spiritedly
about the World Cup.
"It's got to be Ireland," said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful of potato.
"They flattened Peru in the semifinals."
"Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though," said Fred.
"Krum's one decent player, Ireland has got seven," said Charlie shortly. "I wish
England had got through. That was embarrassing, that was."
"What happened?" said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his isolation
from the wizarding world when he was stuck on Privet Drive.
"Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten," said Charlie
gloomily. "Shocking performance. And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland
was slaughtered by Luxembourg."
Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first
year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a
Firebolt. Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the
magical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House
team.
Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had
their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths
were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the
smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at
peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the
rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.
Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all
busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, "So — have you heard from
Sirius lately?"
Hermione looked around, listening closely.
"Yeah," said Harry softly, "twice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him yesterday.
He might write back while I'm here."
He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a moment
was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and
about the dream that had awoken him ... but he really didn't want to worry them
just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.
"Look at the time," Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch.
"You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you you'll be up at the crack of
dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your school list out, I'll get your
things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley. I'm getting everyone else's. There
might not be time after the World Cup, the match went on for five days last
time."
"Wow — hope it does this time!" said Harry enthusiastically.
"Well, I certainly don't," said Percy sanctimoniously. "I shudder to think what
the state of my in-tray would be if I was away from work for five days."
"Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?" said Fred.
"That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!" said Percy, going very red in
the face. "It was nothing personal!"
"It was," Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table. "We sent it."
CHAPTER SIX – THE PORTKEY
Harry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in Ron's room when he
was being shaken awake by Mrs. Weasley.
"Time to go, Harry, dear," she whispered, moving away to wake Ron.
Harry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and sat up. It was still dark
outside. Ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him. At the foot of
Harry's mattress he saw two large, disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of
blankets.
"'S' time already?" said Fred groggily.
They dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then, yawning and stretching, the
four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen.
Mrs. Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove, while Mr.
Weasley was sitting at the table, checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets.
He looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his
clothes more clearly. He was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater
and a very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick
leather belt.
"What d'you think?" he asked anxiously. "We're supposed to go incognito —
do I look like a Muggle, Harry?"
"Yeah," said Harry, smiling, "very good."
"Where're Bill and Charlie and Per—Per—Percy?" said George, failing to
stifle a huge yawn.
"Well, they're Apparating, aren't they?" said Mrs. Weasley, heaving the large
pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls. "So they can
have a bit of a lie-in."
Harry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from one place and
reappearing almost instantly in another, but had never known any Hogwarts
student to do it, and understood that it was very difficult.
"So they're still in bed?" said Fred grumpily, pulling his bowl of porridge
toward him. "Why can't we Apparate too?"
"Because you're not of age and you haven't passed your test," snapped Mrs.
Weasley. "And where have those girls got to?"
She bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs.
"You have to pass a test to Apparate?" Harry asked.
"Oh yes," said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of
his jeans. "The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of
people the other day for Apparating without a license. It's not easy, Apparition,
and when it's not done property it can lead to nasty complications. This pair I'm
talking about went and splinched themselves."
Everyone around the table except Harry winced.
"Er — splinched?" said Harry.
"They left half of themselves behind," said Mr. Weasley, now spooning large
amounts of treacle onto his porridge. "So, of course, they were stuck. Couldn't
move either way. Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort
them out. Meant a fair old bit of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the
Muggles who spotted the body parts they'd left behind....."
Harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on
the pavement of Privet Drive.
"Were they okay?" he asked, startled.
"Oh yes," said Mr. Weasley matter-of-factly. "But they got a heavy fine, and I
don't think they'll be trying it again in a hurry. You don't mess around with
Apparition. There are plenty of adult wizards who don't bother with it. Prefer
brooms — slower, but safer."
"But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?"
"Charlie had to take the test twice," said Fred, grinning. "He failed the first
time. Apparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some
poor old dear doing her shopping, remember?"
"Yes, well, he passed the second time," said Mrs. Weasley, marching back into
the kitchen amid hearty sniggers.
"Percy only passed two weeks ago," said George. "He's been Apparating
downstairs every morning since, just to prove he can."
There were footsteps down the passageway and Hermione and Ginny came into
the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.
"Why do we have to be up so early?" Ginny said, rubbing her eyes and sitting
down at the table.
"We've got a bit of a walk," said Mr. Weasley.
"Walk?" said Harry. "What, are we walking to the World Cup?"
"No, no, that's miles away," said Mr. Weasley, smiling. "We only need to walk
a short way. It's just that it's very difficult for a large number of wizards to
congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful
about how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the
Quidditch World Cup..."
"George!" said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all jumped.
"What?" said George, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody.
"What is that in your pocket?"
"Nothing!"
"Don't you lie to me!"
Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George's pocket and said, "Accio!"
Several small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of George's pocket; he made
a grab for them but missed, and they sped right into Mrs. Weasley's outstretched
hand.
"We told you to destroy them!" said Mrs. Weasley furiously, holding up what
were unmistakably more Ton-Tongue Toffees. "We told you to get rid of the
lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!"
It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as
many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her
Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to find them all.
"Accio! Accio! Accio!" she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of
unlikely places, including the lining of George's jacket and the turn-ups of
Fred's jeans.
"We spent six months developing those!" Fred shouted at his mother as she
threw the toffees away.
"Oh a fine way to spend six months!" she shrieked. "No wonder you didn't get
more O.W.L.s!"
All in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure.
Mrs. Weasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr. Weasley on the cheek,
though not nearly as much as the twins, who had each hoisted their rucksacks
onto their backs and walked out without a word to her.
"Well, have a lovely time," said Mrs. Weasley, "and behave yourselves," she
called after the twins' retreating backs, but they did not look back or answer.
"I'll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday," Mrs. Weasley said to
Mr. Weasley, as he, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across the dark
yard after Fred and George.
It was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull, greenish tinge along the
horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer. Harry, having
been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the Quidditch World
Cup, sped up to walk with Mr. Weasley.
"So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing?" he asked.
"It's been a massive organizational problem," sighed Mr. Weasley. "The
trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of
course, we just haven't got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all.
There are places Muggles can't penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred
thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So we
had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as
possible. The whole Ministry's been working on it for months. First, of course,
we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two
weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can't have
too many clogging up their buses and trains — remember, wizards are coming
from all over the world. Some Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe
points for them to appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there's a handy
wood they're using as the Apparition point. For those who don't want to
Apparate, or can't, we use Portkeys. They're objects that are used to transport
wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do large
groups at a time if you need to. There have been two hundred Portkeys placed
at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of
Stoatshead Hill, so that's where we're headed."
Mr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose beyond the
village of Ottery St. Catchpole.
"What sort of objects are Portkeys?" said Harry curiously.
"Well, they can be anything," said Mr. Weasley. "Unobtrusive things,
obviously, so Muggles don't go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff
they'll just think is litter...."
They trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the village, the silence broken
only by their footsteps. The sky lightened very slowly as they made their way
through the village, its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue. Harry's hands
and feet were freezing. Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.
They didn't have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb Stoatshead
Hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick black
tuffets of grass. Each breath Harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were
starting to seize up when, at last, his feet found level ground.
"Whew," panted Mr. Weasley, taking off his glasses and wiping them on his
sweater. "Well, we've made good time — we've got ten minutes."
Hermione came over the crest of the hill last, clutching a stitch in her side.
"Now we just need the Portkey," said Mr. Weasley, replacing his glasses and
squinting around at the ground. "It won't be big.... Come on..."
They spread out, searching. They had only been at it for a couple of minutes,
however, when a shout rent the still air.
"Over here, Arthur! Over here, son, we've got it."
Two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the
hilltop.
"Amos!" said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man who had
shouted. The rest of them followed.
Mr. Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy-faced wizard with a scrubby
brown beard, who was holding a moldy-looking old boot in his other hand.
"This is Amos Diggory, everyone," said Mr. Weasley. "He works for the
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And I think
you know his son, Cedric?"
Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was
Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.
"Hi," said Cedric, looking around at them all.
Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They
had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first
Quidditch match of the previous year.
"Long walk, Arthur?" Cedric's father asked. "Not too bad," said Mr. Weasley.
"We live just on the other side of the village there. You?"
"Had to get up at two, didn't we, Ced? I tell you, I'll be glad when he's got his
Apparition test. Still ... not complaining ... Quidditch World Cup, wouldn't
miss it for a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about that. Mind you,
looks like I got off easy. . . ." Amos Diggory peered good-naturedly around at
the three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny. "All these yours,
Arthur?"
"Oh no, only the redheads," said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children. "This
is Hermione, friend of Ron's — and Harry, another friend —"
"Merlin's beard," said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. "Harry? Harry
Potter?"
"Er — yeah," said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to
the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it
always made him feel uncomfortable.
"Ced's talked about you, of course," said Amos Diggory. "Told us all about
playing against you last year... I said to him, I said — Ced, that'll be something
to tell your grandchildren, that will.... You beat Harry Potter!"
Harry couldn't think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and George
were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.
"Harry fell off his broom, Dad," he muttered. I told you ... it was an
accident...."
"Yes, but you didn't fall off, did you?" roared Amos genially, slapping his son
on his back. "Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the best
man won, I'm sure Harry'd say the same, wouldn't you, eh? One falls off his
broom, one stays on, you don't need to be a genius to tell which one's the better
flier!"
"Must be nearly time," said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again.
"Do you know whether we're waiting for any more, Amos?"
"No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts
couldn't get tickets," said Mr. Diggory. "There aren't any more of us in this
area, are there?"
"Not that I know of," said Mr. Weasley. "Yes, it's a minute off ... We'd better
get ready...."
He looked around at Harry and Hermione.
"You just need to touch the Portkey, that's all, a finger will do —"
With difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded
around the old boot held out by Amos Diggory.
They all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop.
Nobody spoke. It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd this would look if a
Muggle were to walk up here now ... nine people, two of them grown men,
clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness, waiting....
"Three. . ." muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his watch, two. . . one. . ."
It happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had
been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. His feet left the ground; he could feel
Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they
were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger
was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and
then —
His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over; the
Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud.
Harry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were still standing,
though looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground.
"Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill," said a voice.
CHAPTER SEVEN – BAGMAN AND CROUCH
Harry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet. They had arrived on
what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor. In front of them was a
pair of tired and grumpy-looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large
gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed
as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the watch wore a tweed suit
with thigh-length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.
"Morning, Basil," said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the
kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry
could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.
"Hello there, Arthur," said Basil wearily. "Not on duty, eh? It's all right for
some.... We've been here all night.... You'd better get out of the way, we've got a
big party coming in from the Black Forest at five fifteen. Hang on, I'll find your
campsite.... Weasley ... Weasley...." He consulted his parchment list. "About a
quarter of a mile's walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager's
called Mr. Roberts. Diggory ... second field ... ask for Mr. Payne."
"Thanks, Basil," said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow him.
They set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the
mist. After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam
into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds
and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark
wood on the horizon. They said good-bye to the Diggorys and approached the
cottage door.
A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents. Harry knew at a
glance that this was the only real Muggle for several acres. When he heard their
footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.
"Morning!" said Mr. Weasley brightly.
"Morning," said the Muggle.
"Would you be Mr. Roberts?"
"Aye, I would," said Mr. Roberts. "And who're you?"
"Weasley — two tents, booked a couple of days ago?"
"Aye," said Mr. Roberts, consulting a list tacked to the door. "You've got a
space up by the wood there. Just the one night?"
"That's it," said Mr. Weasley.
"You'll be paying now, then?" said Mr. Roberts.
"Ah — right — certainly —" said Mr. Weasley. He retreated a short distance
from the cottage and beckoned Harry toward him. "Help me, Harry," he
muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel
the notes apart. "This one's a — a — a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number on it
now... So this is a five?"
"A twenty," Harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of Mr.
Roberts trying to catch every word.
"Ah yes, so it is.... I don't know, these little bits of paper..."
"You foreign?" said Mr. Roberts as Mr. Weasley returned with the correct
notes.
"Foreign?" repeated Mr. Weasley, puzzled.
"You're not the first one who's had trouble with money," said Mr. Roberts,
scrutinizing Mr. Weasley closely. "I had two try and pay me with great gold
coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago."
"Did you really?" said Mr. Weasley nervously.
Mr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change.
"Never been this crowded," he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field
again. "Hundreds of pre-bookings. People usually just turn up...."
"Is that right?" said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out for his change, but Mr.
Roberts didn't give it to him.
"Aye," he said thoughtfully. "People from all over. Loads of foreigners. And
not just foreigners. Weirdos, you know? There's a bloke walking 'round in a
kilt and a poncho."
"Shouldn't he?" said Mr. Weasley anxiously
"It's like some sort of... I dunno ... like some sort of rally," said Mr. Roberts.
"They all seem to know each other. Like a big party."
At that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr.
Roberts's front door.
"Obliviate!" he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr. Roberts.
Instantly, Mr. Roberts's eyes slid out of focus, his brows unknitted, and a took
of dreamy unconcern fell over his face. Harry recognized the symptoms of one
who had just had his memory modified.
"A map of the campsite for you," Mr. Roberts said placidly to Mr. Weasley.
"And your change."
"Thanks very much," said Mr. Weasley.
The wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite.
He looked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep
purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he
muttered to Mr. Weasley, "Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a
Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman's not
helping. Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his
voice, not a worry about anti-Muggle security Blimey, I'll be glad when this is
over. See you later, Arthur."
He Disapparated.
"I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports," said Ginny,
looking surprised. "He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near
Muggles, shouldn't he?"
"He should," said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates
into the campsite, "but Ludo's always been a bit ... well . . . lax about security.
You couldn't wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though.
He played Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best
Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had."
They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked
almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as
possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes.
However, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could
hardly be surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious. Halfway up the
field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace,
with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther on they
passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond
that was a tent that had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial,
and fountain.
"Always the same," said Mr. Weasley, smiling. "We can't resist showing off
when we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us."
They had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was
an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read
WEEZLY.
"Couldn't have a better spot!" said Mr. Weasley happily. "The field is just on
the other side of the wood there, we're as close as we could be." He hoisted his
backpack from his shoulders. "Right," he said excitedly, "no magic allowed,
strictly speaking, not when we're out in these numbers on Muggle land. We'll
be putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn't be too difficult.... Muggles do it all
the time.... Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?"
Harry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him on
any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old neighbor.
However, he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs
should go, and though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help,
because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they
finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents.
All of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody looking at these
tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was
that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten.
Hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical
look as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.
"We'll be a bit cramped," he called, "but I think we'll all squeeze in. Come and
have a look."
Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop. He had
walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three room flat, complete with
bathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort
of style as Mrs. Figg's house: There were crocheted covers on the mismatched
chairs and a strong smell of cats.
"Well, it's not for long," said Mr. Weasley, mopping his bald patch with a
handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom. I
borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn't camp much anymore, poor
fellow, he's got lumbago."
He picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it. "We'll need water....
"There's a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us," said Ron, who had
followed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its
extraordinary inner proportions. "It's on the other side of the field."
"Well, why don't you, Harry, and Hermione go and get us some water then" —
Mr. Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans — "and the rest
of us will get some wood for a fire?"
"But we've got an oven," said Ron. "Why can't we just —"
"Ron, anti-Muggle security!" said Mr. Weasley, his face shining with
anticipation. "When real Muggles camp, they cook on fires outdoors. I've seen
them at it!"
After a quick tour of the girls' tent, which was slightly smaller than the boys',
though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off across the
campsite with the kettle and saucepans.
Now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city of
tents that stretched in every direction. They made their way slowly through the
rows, staring eagerly around. It was only just dawning on Harry how many
witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought
much about those in other countries.
Their fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families
with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young
before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramidshaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which
was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his
mother came hurrying out of the tent.
"How many times, Kevin? You don't — touch — Daddy's — wand —
yecchh! "
She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them
on the still air, mingling with the little boy's yells — "You bust slug! You bust
slug!"
A short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin,
who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls' toes to
skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he
hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly, "In broad
daylight! Parents having a lie-in, I suppose —"
Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and
starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires
with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their
faces, as though sure this couldn't work. Three African wizards sat in serious
conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked
like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged American
witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their
tents that read: THE SALEM WITCHES' INSTITUTE. Harry caught
snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they
passed, and though he couldn't understand a word, the tone of every single voice
was excited.
"Er — is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?" said Ron.
It wasn't just Ron's eyes. They had walked into a patch of tents that were all
covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small,
oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth. Grinning faces could be
seen under those that had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they heard
their names.
"Harry! Ron! Hermione!"
It was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth year. He was sitting in
front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to
be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor.
"Like the decorations?" said Seamus, grinning. "The Ministry's not too happy."
"Ah, why shouldn't we show our colors?" said Mrs. Finnigan. "You should see
what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents. You'll be supporting
Ireland, of course?" she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione beadily.
When they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set
off again, though, as Ron said, "Like we'd say anything else surrounded by that
lot." I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents?" said
Hermione.
"Let's go and have a look," said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upfield,
where the Bulgarian flag — white, green, and red — was fluttering in the
breeze.
The tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of
them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy
black eyebrows. The picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and
scowl.
"Krum," said Ron quietly.
"What?" said Hermione.
"Krum!" said Ron. "Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker!"
"He looks really grumpy," said Hermione, looking around at the many Krums
blinking and scowling at them.
"'Really grumpy?" Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. "Who cares what he
looks like? He's unbelievable. He's really young too. Only just eighteen or
something. He's a genius, you wait until tonight, you'll see."
There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a
heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long
flowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding
out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.
"Just put them on, Archie, there's a good chap. You can't walk around like that,
the Muggle at the gate's already getting suspicious —
I bought this in a Muggle shop," said the old wizard stubbornly. "Muggles
wear them."
"Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these," said the
Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.
"I'm not putting them on," said old Archie in indignation. "I like a healthy
breeze 'round my privates, thanks."
Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that
she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected
his water and moved away.
Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their
way back through the campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar faces:
other Hogwarts students with their families. Oliver Wood, the old captain of
Harry's House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over
to his parents' tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been
signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Next they were hailed by Ernie
Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year, and a little farther on they saw Cho
Chang, a very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team. She
waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as
he waved back. More to stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry
hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen
before.
"Who d'you reckon they are?" he said. "They don't go to Hogwarts, do they?"
"'Spect they go to some foreign school," said Ron. "I know there are others.
Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in
Brazil ... this was years and years ago ... and he wanted to go on an exchange
trip but Mum and Dad couldn't afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he
said he wasn't going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up."
Harry laughed but didn't voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other
wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many
nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that
Hogwarts couldn't be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked
utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news
about other wizarding schools in some book or other.
"You've been ages," said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys'
tents.
"Met a few people," said Ron, setting the water down. "You've not got that fire
started yet?"
"Dad's having fun with the matches," said Fred.
Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn't for
lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he
looked as though he was having the time of his life.
"Oops!" he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in
surprise.
"Come here, Mr. Weasley," said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him,
and showing him how to do it properly.
At last they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour before it was hot
enough to cook anything. There was plenty to watch while they waited,
however. Their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare
to the field, and Ministry members kept hurrying up and down it, greeting Mr.
Weasley cordially as they passed. Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary,
mainly for Harry's and Hermione's benefit; his own children knew too much
about the Ministry to be greatly interested.
"That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin Liaison Office.... Here
comes Gilbert Wimple; he's with the Committee on Experimental Charms; he's
had those horns for a while now... Hello, Arnie ... Arnold Peasegood, he's an
Obliviator — member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, you know...
and that's Bode and Croaker ... they're Unspeakables...."
"They're what?"
"From the Department of Mysteries, top secret, no idea what they get up to...."
At last, the fire was ready, and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages
when Bill, Charlie, and Percy came strolling out of the woods toward them.
"Just Apparated, Dad," said Percy loudly. "Ah, excellent, lunch!"
They were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when Mr.
Weasley jumped to his feet, waving and grinning at a man who was striding
toward them. "Aha!" he said. "The man of the moment! Ludo!"
Ludo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had seen so far,
even including old Archie in his flowered nightdress. He was wearing long
Quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black. An
enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest. He had the look of a
powerfully built man gone slightly to seed; the robes were stretched tightly
across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played
Quidditch for England. His nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray
Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy
complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy.
"Ahoy there!" Bagman called happily. He was walking as though he had
springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild
excitement.
"Arthur, old man," he puffed as he reached the campfire, "what a day, eh?
What a day! Could we have asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless night
coming ... and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements.... Not much for me to
do!"
Behind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry wizards rushed past, pointing
at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet
sparks twenty feet into the air.
Percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched. Apparently his disapproval
of the way Ludo Bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting
to make a good impression.
"Ah — yes," said Mr. Weasley, grinning, "this is my son Percy. He's just
started at the Ministry — and this is Fred — no, George, sorry — that's Fred —
Bill, Charlie, Ron — my daughter, Ginny and Ron's friends, Hermione Granger
and Harry Potter."
Bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry's name, and his
eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry's forehead.
"Everyone," Mr. Weasley continued, "this is Ludo Bagman, you know who he
is, it's thanks to him we've got such good tickets —"
Bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing.
"Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?" he said eagerly, jingling what seemed
to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellow-and-black robes. "I've
already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first — I offered him
nice odds, considering Ireland's front three are the strongest I've seen in years —
and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong
match."
"Oh ... go on then," said Mr. Weasley. "Let's see ... a Galleon on Ireland to
win?"
"A Galleon?" Ludo Bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered
himself. "Very well, very well ... any other takers?"
"They're a bit young to be gambling," said Mr. Weasley. "Molly wouldn't like
—"
"We'll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts," said Fred as he
and George quickly pooled all their money, "that Ireland wins — but Viktor
Krum gets the Snitch. Oh and we'll throw in a fake wand."
"You don't want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that," Percy hissed,
but Bagman didn't seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary,
his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and when the
wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared
with laughter.
"Excellent! I haven't seen one that convincing in years! I'd pay five Galleons
for that!"
Percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.
"Boys," said Mr. Weasley under his breath, "I don't want you betting.... That's
all your savings .... Your mother —"
"Don't be a spoilsport, Arthur!" boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling his pockets
excitedly. "They're old enough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland
will win but Krum'll get the Snitch? Not a chance, boys, not a chance.... I'll
give you excellent odds on that one .... We'll add five Galleons for the funny
wand, then, shall we...."
Mr. Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman whipped out a notebook
and quill and began jotting down the twins' names.
"Cheers," said George, taking the slip of parchment Bagman handed him and
tucking it away into the front of his robes. Bagman turned most cheerfully back
to Mr. Weasley.
"Couldn't do me a brew, I suppose? I'm keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch.
My Bulgarian opposite number's making difficulties, and I can't understand a
word he's saying. Barty'll be able to sort it out. He speaks about a hundred and
fifty languages."
"Mr. Crouch?" said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker-stiff
disapproval and positively writhing with excitement. "He speaks over two
hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll. . ."
"Anyone can speak Troll," said Fred dismissively. "All you have to do is point
and grunt."
Percy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to
bring the kettle back to the boil.
"Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?" Mr. Weasley asked as Bagman
settled himself down on the grass beside them all.
"Not a dicky bird," said Bagman comfortably. "But she'll turn up. Poor old
Bertha ... memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you
take my word for it. She'll wander back into the office sometime in October,
thinking it's still July."
"You don't think it might be time to send someone to look for her?" Mr.
Weasley suggested tentatively as Percy handed Bagman his tea.
"Barty Crouch keeps saying that," said Bagman, his round eyes widening
innocently, "but we really can't spare anyone at the moment. Oh — talk of the
devil! Barty!"
A wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he could not have made more
of a contrast with Ludo Bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp robes.
Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp
suit and tie. The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight,
and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a
slide rule. His shoes were very highly polished. Harry could see at once why
Percy idolized him. Percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and
Mr. Crouch had complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly
that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle
Vernon would have spotted him for what he really was.
"Pull up a bit of grass, Barry," said Ludo brightly, patting the ground beside
him.
"No thank you, Ludo," said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his
voice. "I've been looking for you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we
add another twelve seats to the Top Box."
"Oh is that what they're after?" said Bagman. I thought the chap was asking to
borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong accent."
"Mr. Crouch!" said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of halfbow that made
him look like a hunchback. "Would you like a cup of tea?"
"Oh," said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise. "Yes — thank
you, Weatherby."
Fred and George choked into their own cups. Percy, very pink around the ears,
busied himself with the kettle.
"Oh and I've been wanting a word with you too, Arthur," said Mr. Crouch, his
sharp eyes falling upon Mr. Weasley. "Ali Bashir's on the warpath. He wants a
word with you about your embargo on flying carpets."
Mr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.
"I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I've told him once I've told him a
hundred times: Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of
Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?"
"I doubt it," said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy. "He's desperate to
export here."
"Well, they'll never replace brooms in Britain, will they?" said Bagman.
"Ali thinks there's a niche in the market for a family vehicle, said Mr. Crouch.
"I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve — but
that was before carpets were banned, of course."
He spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his
ancestors had abided strictly by the law.
"So, been keeping busy, Barty?" said Bagman breezily.
"Fairly," said Mr. Crouch dryly. "Organizing Portkeys across five continents is
no mean feat, Ludo."
"I expect you'll both be glad when this is over?" said Mr. Weasley.
Ludo Bagman looked shocked.
"Glad! Don't know when I've had more fun.... Still, it's not as though we
haven't got anything to took forward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organize,
eh?"
Mr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman.
"We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details —"
"Oh details!" said Bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges.
"They've signed, haven't they? They've agreed, haven't they? I bet you
anything these kids'll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it's happening at
Hogwarts —"
"Ludo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know," said Mr. Crouch sharply,
cutting Bagman's remarks short. "Thank you for the tea, Weatherby."
He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise; Bagman
struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets
chinking merrily.
"See you all later!" he said. "You'll be up in the Top Box with me — I'm
commentating!" He waved, Barty Crouch nodded curtly, and both of them
Disapparated.
"What's happening at Hogwarts, Dad?" said Fred at once. "What were they
talking about?"
"You'll find out soon enough," said Mr.Weasley, smiling.
"It's classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it,"
said Percy stiffly. "Mr. Crouch was quite right not to disclose it."
"Oh shut up, Weatherby," said Fred.
A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the
afternoon wore on. By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering
with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of
waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed
to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic
now breaking out everywhere.
Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full
of extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes — green for
Ireland, red for Bulgaria — which were squealing the names of the players,
pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves
adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries that played their
national anthems as they were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that
really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the
palm of your hand, preening themselves.
"Been saving my pocket money all summer for this," Ron told Harry as they
and Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron
purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a
small figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum
walked backward and forward over Ron's hand, scowling up at the green rosette
above him.
"Wow, look at these!" said Harry, hurrying over to a cart piled high with what
looked like brass binoculars, except that they were covered with all sorts of
weird knobs and dials.
"Omnioculars," said the saleswizard eagerly. "You can replay action ... slow
everything down ... and they flash up a play-by- play breakdown if you need it.
Bargain — ten Galleons each."
"Wish I hadn't bought this now," said Ron, gesturing at his dancing shamrock
hat and gazing longingly at the Omnioculars.
"Three pairs," said Harry firmly to the wizard.
"No — don't bother," said Ron, going red. He was always touchy about the fact
that Harry, who had inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much more
money than he did.
"You won't be getting anything for Christmas," Harry told him, thrusting
Omnioculars into his and Hermione's hands. "For about ten years, mind."
"Fair enough," said Ron, grinning.
"Oooh, thanks, Harry," said Hermione. "And I'll get us some programs, look —
"
Their money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents. Bill,
Charlie, and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and Mr. Weasley was
carrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had no souvenirs as they had given
Bagman all their gold.
And then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods, and at
once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to the
field.
"It's time!" said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any of them. "Come on,
let's go!"
CHAPTER EIGHT – THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP
Clutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the
wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands
of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The
atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn't stop
grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and
joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves
in the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry could see only a fraction of
the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals
would fit comfortably inside it.
"Seats a hundred thousand," said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on
Harry's face. "Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all
year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have
got anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent
appointments and had to dash away again ... bless them," he added fondly,
leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by
a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.
"Prime seats!" said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their
tickets. "Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go."
The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered
upward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors
into the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley's party kept climbing, and at
last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box,
set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the
golden goal posts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here,
and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a
scene the likes of which he could never have imagined.
A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats,
which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a
mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The
field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the field
stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry's eye
level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as though
an invisible giant's hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it
off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the
field.
The Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family — safe, reliable, and with Built-in
Anti-Burgler Buzzer ... Mrs. Shower's All Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No
Pain, No Stain! ... Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris, Hogsmeade...
Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who
else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny
creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them.
The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair,
was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its
hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar....
"Dobby?" said Harry incredulously.
The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown
eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn't Dobby —
it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry's friend Dobby had been.
Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.
"Did sir just call me Dobby?" squeaked the elf curiously from between its
fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby's had been, a teeny, quivering
squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a
house-elf — that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around
in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry,
they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.
"Sorry," Harry told the elf, "I just thought you were someone I knew."
"But I knows Dobby too, sir!" squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as
though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. "My name is
Winky, sir — and you, sir —" Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side
plates as they rested upon Harry's scar. "You is surely Harry Potter!"
"Yeah, I am," said Harry.
"But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!" s he said, lowering her hands very
slightly and looking awestruck.
"How is he?" said Harry. "How's freedom suiting him?"
"Ah, sir," said Winky, shaking her head, "ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but
I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free."
"Why?" said Harry, taken aback. "What's wrong with him?"
"Freedom is going to Dobby's head, sir, " said Winky sadly. "Ideas above his
station, sir. Can't get another position, sir."
"Why not?" said Harry.
Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, "He is wanting
paying for his work, sir."
"Paying?" said Harry blankly. "Well — why shouldn't he be paid?"
Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that
her face was half-hidden again.
"House-elves is not paid, sir!" she said in a muffled squeak. "No, no, no. I
says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby.
He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf.
You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you's
up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures, like some common goblin."
"Well, it's about time he had a bit of fun," said Harry.
"House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter," said Winky firmly,
from behind her hands. "House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking
heights at all, Harry Potter" — she glanced toward the edge of the box and
gulped — "but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir."
"Why's he sent you up here, if he knows you don't like heights?" said Harry,
frowning.
"Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very busy,"
said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her. "Winky is
wishing she is back in master's tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is
told. Winky is a good house-elf."
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes
completely again. Harry turned back to the others.
"So that's a house-elf?" Ron muttered. "Weird things, aren't they?"
"Dobby was weirder," said Harry fervently.
Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the
crowd on the other side of the stadium.
"Wild!" he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. I can make that old
bloke down there pick his nose again ... and again ... and again. . ."
Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered,
tasseled program.
"'A display from the team mascots will precede the match,"' she read aloud.
"Oh that's always worth watching," said Mr. Weasley. "National teams bring
creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show."
The box filled gradually around them over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley
kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards.
Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit
on a hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself, arrived,
Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly embarrassed,
he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing
jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend.
They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry's hand in a fatherly fashion, asked
how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him.
"Harry Potter, you know," he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was
wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn't seem to
understand a word of English. "Harry Potter ... oh come on now, you know
who he is ... the boy who survived You-Know-Who ... you do know who he is
—"
The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry's scar and started gabbling loudly
and excitedly, pointing at it.
"Knew we'd get there in the end," said Fudge wearily to Harry. "I'm no great
shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his
house-elf's saving him a seat.... Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have
been trying to cadge all the best places ... ah, and here's Lucius!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to
three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby
the house-elf's former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman
Harry supposed must be Draco's mother.
Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to
Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly
resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have
been nice-looking if she hadn’t been wearing a look that suggested there was a
nasty smell under her nose.
“Ah, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the Minister
of Magic. “How are you? I don’t think you’ve met my wife, Narcissa? Or our
son, Draco?”
“How do you do, how do you do?” said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs.
Malfoy. “And allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk - Obalonsk - Mr. -
well, he’s the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can’t understand a word I’m
saying anyway, so never mind. And let’s see who else - you know Arthur
Weasley, I daresay?”
It was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at each other and
Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come face-to-face: It had been in
Flourish and Blotts’ bookshop, and they had had a fight. Mr. Malfoy’s cold
gray eyes swept over Mr. Weasley, and then up and down the row.
“Good lord, Arthur,” he said softly. “What did you have to sell to get seats in
the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn’t have fetched this much?”
Fudge, who wasn’t listening, said, “Lucius has just given a very generous
contribution to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries,
Arthur. He’s here as my guest.”
“How - how nice,” said Mr. Weasley, with a very strained smile.
Mr. Malfoy’s eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared
determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr. Malfoy’s
lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other
words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second-class.
However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy didn’t dare say
anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and continued down the line to
his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron, and Hermione one contemptuous look, then
settled himself between his mother and father.
“Slimy gits,” Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned to face the field
again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box.
“Everyone ready?” he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam.
“Minister - ready to go?”
“Ready when you are, Ludo,” said Fudge comfortably.
Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said “Sonorus!”
and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium;
his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands.
“Ladies and gentlemen. . . welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred
and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!”
The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their
discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them
was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans – A Risk
With Every Mouthful!) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.
“And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce. . . the Bulgarian
National Team Mascots!”
The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its
approval.
“I wonder what they’ve brought,” said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his
seat. “Aaah!” He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly
on his robes. “Veela!”
“What are veel –?”
But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry’s question
was answered for him. Veela were women. . . the most beautiful women Harry
had ever seen. . . except that they weren’t - they couldn’t be - human. This
puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be;
what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair
fan out behind them without wind.. . but then the music started, and Harry
stopped worrying about them not being human - in fact, he stopped worrying
about anything at all.
The veela had started to dance, and Harry’s mind had gone completely and
blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the
veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen.
And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started
chasing through Harry’s dazed mind. He wanted to do something very
impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good
idea. . . but would it be good enough?
“Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione’s voice from a long way off.
The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was
resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that
looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard.
Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn’t want the veela to go.
Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he
wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron,
meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr.
Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his
hands.
“You’ll be wanting that,” he said, “once Ireland have had their say.”
“Huh?” said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up
along one side of the field.
Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back
into his seat. “Honestly!” she said.
“And now,” roared Ludo Bagman’s voice, “kindly put your wands in the air. . .
for the Irish National Team Mascots!”
Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming
into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller
comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts. A rainbow arced suddenly across
the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed,
as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light
reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which
rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands. Something like golden
rain seemed to be falling from it - “Excellent!” yelled Ron as the shamrock
soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads
and seats. Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually
comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a
minute lamp of gold or green.
“Leprechauns!” said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd,
many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to
retrieve the gold.
“There you go,” Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry’s
hand, “for the Omnioculars! Now you’ve got to buy me a Christmas present,
ha!”
The great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on
the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch
the match.
“And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome - the Bulgarian National
Quidditch Team! I give you - Dimitrov!”
A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out
onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian
supporters.
“Ivanova!”
A second scarlet-robed player zoomed out.
“Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand - Krum!”
“That’s him, that’s him!” yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars.
Harry quickly focused his own.
Viktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large curved nose and
thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to
believe he was only eighteen.
“And now, please greet - the Irish National Quidditch Team!” yelled Bagman.
“Presenting - Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand -
Lynch!”
Seven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial on the side of
his Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word
“Firebolt” on each of their brooms and see their names, embroidered in silver,
upon their backs.
“And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the
International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!”
A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle
Vernon’s, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the
field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was
carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other.
Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely
as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open - four balls burst
into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for
the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden
Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the
balls.
“Theeeeeeeey’re OFF!” screamed Bagman. “And it’s Mullet! Troy! Moran!
Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!”
It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his
Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his
nose. The speed of the players was incredible - the Chasers were throwing the
Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names.
Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the
play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow
motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise
of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.
HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three
Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet
and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up
next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away
the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the
Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small
club, knocking it into Moran’s path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and
dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it - “TROY
SCORES!” roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause
and cheers. “Ten zero to Ireland!”
“What?” Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. “But
Levski’s got the Quaffle!”
“Harry, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed, you’re going to miss
things!” shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in
the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly
over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the
sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering
shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily.
Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play
resumed.
Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb.
They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they
appeared to be reading one another’s minds as they positioned themselves, and
the rosette on Harry’s chest kept squeaking their names: “Troy - Mullet - Mo
ran!” And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their
lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the
green-clad supporters.
The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the
Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the
Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best
moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to
break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria’s first
goal.
“Fingers in your ears!” bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in
celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the
game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had
stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle.
“Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova - oh I say!” roared Bagman.
One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch,
plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though
they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their
descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was –
“They’re going to crash!” screamed Hermione next to Harry.
She was half right - at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive
and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be
heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.
“Fool!” moaned Mr. Weasley. “Krum was feinting!”
“It’s time-out!” yelled Bagman’s voice, “as trained mediwizards hurry onto the
field to examine Aidan Lynch!”
“He’ll be okay, he only got ploughed!” Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who
was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. “Which is what
Krum was after, of course... .“
Harry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his Omnioculars,
twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes.
He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI
DEFENSIVE FEINT - DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining
purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum’s face contorted with
concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was
flattened, and he understood - Krum hadn’t seen the Snitch at all, he was just
making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum
hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily
through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his
Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling
high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion.
Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum’s face, saw his dark eyes darting
all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch
was revived to look for the Snitch without interference.
Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters,
mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to
give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers
moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.
After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten
more goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and
the game was starting to get dirtier.
As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly
under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever
happened was over so quickly Harry didn’t catch it, but a scream of rage from
the Irish crowd, and Mostafa’s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a
foul.
“And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing -- excessive use
of elbows!” Bagman informed the roaring spectators. “And - yes, it’s a penalty
to Ireland!”
The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering
hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words
“HA, HA, HA!” The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet,
tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again.
As one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but
Hermione, who hadn’t bothered, was soon tugging on Harry’s arm. He turned
to look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears.
“Look at the referee!” she said, giggling.
Harry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the
dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles
and smoothing his mustache excitedly.
“Now, we can’t have that!” said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly
amused. “Somebody slap the referee!”
A mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own
ears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself;
Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked
exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had
stopped dancing and were looking mutinous.
“And unless I’m much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempting to send off the
Bulgarian team mascots!” said Bagman’s voice. “Now there’s something we
haven’t seen before. . . . Oh this could turn nasty. . .
It did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, landed on either side of
Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating toward the
leprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words “HEE, HEE, HEE.”
Mostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians’ arguments, however; he was
jabbing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when
they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle.
“Two penalties for Ireland!” shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled
with anger. “And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms.
. . yes. . . there they go. . . and Troy takes the Quaffle. .
Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The
Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in
particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or
human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at
Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.
“Foul!” roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of
green.
“Foul!” echoed Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified voice. “Dimitrov skins
Moran - deliberately flying to collide there - and it’s got to be another penalty -
yes, there’s the whistle!”
The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant
hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At
this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across
the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the
leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn’t
look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into
sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their
shoulders –
“And that, boys,” yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, “is
why you should never go for looks alone!”
Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the
leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was
nothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned this way and that, staring
through his Omnioculars, as the Quaffie changed hands with the speed of a
bullet.
“Levski - Dimitrov - Moran - Troy - Mullet - Ivanova - Moran again - Moran -
MORAN SCORES!”
But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the
veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members’ wands, and the
furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game recommenced immediately; now
Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov -
The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard
as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in
the face.
There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum’s nose looked broken, there
was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn’t blow his whistle. He had
become distracted, and Harry couldn’t blame him; one of the veela had thrown
a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight.
Harry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even though he was
supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron
obviously felt the same.
“Time-out! Ah, come on, he can’t play like that, look at him -“
“Look at Lynch!” Harry yelled.
For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry was quite sure
that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real
“He’s seen the Snitch!” Harry shouted. “He’s seen it! Look at him go!”
Half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the Irish
supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on. . .
but Krum was on his tail. How he could see where he was going, Harry had no
idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was
drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground
again –
“They’re going to crash!” shrieked Hermione.
“They’re not!” roared Ron.
“Lynch is!” yelled Harry.
And he was right - for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous
force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela.
“The Snitch, where’s the Snitch?” bellowed Charlie, along the row.
“He’s got it - Krum’s got it - it’s all over!” shouted Harry.
Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the
air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand.
The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the
crowd, who didn’t seem to have realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as
though a great jumbo jet were revving up, the rumbling from the Ireland
supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight.
“IRELAND WINS!” Bagman shouted, who like the Irish, seemed to be taken
aback by the sudden end of the match.
“KRUM GETS THE SNITCH - BUT IRELAND WINS -- good lord, I don’t
think any of us were expecting that!”
“What did he catch the Snitch for?” Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and
down, applauding with his hands over his head. “He ended it when Ireland were
a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!”
“He knew they were never going to catch up!” Harry shouted back over all the
noise, also applauding loudly. “The Irish Chasers were too good. . . . He
wanted to end it on his terms, that’s all. . .
“He was very brave, wasn’t he?” Hermione said, leaning forward to watch
Krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling
leprechauns and veela to get to him. “He looks a terrible mess. . .”
Harry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see what was
happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the
field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He looked
surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up. His team members were
around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the
Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their
mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium, the Irish national anthem
blared from all sides; the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful
selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn.
“Vell, ve fought bravely,” said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He looked
around; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic.
“You can speak English!” said Fudge, sounding outraged. “And you’ve been
letting me mime everything all day!”
“Veil, it vos very funny,” said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging.
“And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the
Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!” roared Bagman.
Harry’s eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box
was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside.
Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast
golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still
looking very disgruntled that he’d been using sign language all day for nothing.
“Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers - Bulgaria!” Bagman
shouted.
And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The
crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and
thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction.
One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and
Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own
minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess.
Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still
holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the
ground. He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But
when Krum’s name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding,
earsplitting roar.
And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and
Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked
strangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup
into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry’s hands were
numb with clapping.
At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on
their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Confolly’s, clutching hard around his
waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at
his throat and muttered, “Quietus.”
“They’ll be talking about this one for years,” he said hoarsely, “a really
unexpected twist, that. . . . shame it couldn’t have lasted longer. . . . Ah yes... .
yes, I owe you. . . how much?”
For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were
standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands
outstretched.
CHAPTER NINE – THE DARK MARK
Don’t tell your mother you’ve been gambling,” Mr. Weasley
implored Fred and George as they all made their way slowly down the purplecarpeted stairs.
“Don’t worry, Dad,” said Fred gleefully, “we’ve got big plans for
this money. We don’t want it confiscated.”
Mr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask
what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn’t
want to know.
They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the
stadium and back to their campsites. Raucous singing was borne toward them
on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and
leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns.
When they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given
the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one
last cup of cocoa together before turning in. They were soon arguing enjoyably
about the match; Mr. Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing
with Charlie, and it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and
spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the
verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny went
into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas
and clambered into their bunks. From the other side of the campsite they could
still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang.
“Oh I am glad I’m not on duty,” muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily. “I wouldn’t
fancy having to go and tell the Irish they’ve got to stop celebrating.”
Harry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling
of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying
overhead, and picturing again some of Krum’s more spectacular moves. He
was itching to get back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint. . . .
Somehow Oliver Wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling
diagrams what that move was supposed to look like.. . . Harry saw himself in
robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a
hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman’s voice echoed
throughout the stadium, “I give you. . . Potter!”
Harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep - his
fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams - all he
knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley was shouting.
“Get up! Ron - Harry - come on now, get up, this is urgent!”
Harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas.
“S’ matter?” he said.
Dimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The noises in the campsite had
changed. The singing had stopped. He could hear screams, and the sound of
people running. He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes, but
Mr. Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, “No
time, Harry - just grab a jacket and get outside - quickly!”
Harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his heels.
By the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see people running
away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field toward
them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire.
Loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them;
then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.
A crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing
straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at them. .
. . They didn’t seem to have faces. . . . Then he realized that their heads were
hooded and their faces masked. High above them, floating along in midair, four
struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It was as though
the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them
were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the
air. Two of the figures were very small.
More wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the
floating bodies. Tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled. Once
or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his
wand. Several caught fire. The screaming grew louder.
The floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning
tent and Harry recognized one of them: Mr. Roberts, the campsite manager.
The other three looked as though they might be his wife and children. One of
the marchers below flipped Mrs. Roberts upside down with his wand; her
nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover
herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.
“That’s sick,” Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle child, who had
begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply
from side to side. “That is really sick. . . .“
Hermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their
nightdresses, with Mr. Weasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill,
Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys’ tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves
rolled up and their wands out.
“We’re going to help the Ministry!” Mr. Weasley shouted over all the noise,
rolling up his own sleeves. “You lot - get into the woods, and stick together.
I’ll come and fetch you when we’ve sorted this out!”
Bill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming
marchers; Mr. Weasley tore after them. Ministry wizards were dashing from
every direction toward the source of the trouble. The crowd beneath the
Roberts family was coming ever closer.
“C’mon,” said Fred, grabbing Ginny’s hand and starting to pull her toward the
wood. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back as
they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than
ever; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded
wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as though
they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.
The colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished.
Dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious
shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night
air. Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he
could not see. Then he heard Ron yell with pain.
“What happened?” said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that Harry
walked into her. “Ron, where are you? Oh this is stupid - lumos!”
She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path. Ron
was lying sprawled on the ground.
“Tripped over a tree root,” he said angrily, getting to his feet again.
“Well, with feet that size, hard not to,” said a drawling voice from behind them.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone
nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he
seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the
trees.
Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared
say in front of Mrs. Weasley.
“Language, Weasley,” said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering. “Hadn’t you better
be hurrying along, now? You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?”
He nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded
from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around
them.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Hermione defiantly. “Granger, they’re
after Muggles, “said Malfoy. “D’you want to be showing off your knickers in
midair? Because if you do, hang around. . . they’re moving this way, and it
would give us all a laugh.”
“Hermione’s a witch,” Harry snarled.
“Have it your own way, Potter,” said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. “If you
think they can’t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.”
“You watch your mouth!” shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that
“Mudblood” was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle
parentage.
“Never mind, Ron,” said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron’s arm to restrain him
as he took a step toward Malfoy.
There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than
anything they had heard. Several people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled
softly.
“Scare easily, don’t they?” he said lazily. “I suppose your daddy told you all to
hide? What’s he up to - trying to rescue the Muggles?”
“Where’re your parents?” said Harry, his temper rising. “Out there wearing
masks, are they?”
Malfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.
“Well. . . if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?”
“Oh come on,” said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, “let’s go and
find the others.”
“Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” sneered Malfoy.
“Come on,” Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path
again.
“I’ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot!” said Ron hotly.
“Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!” said Hermione fervently.
“Oh I can’t believe this. Where have the others got to?”
Fred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed
with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders toward
the commotion back at the campsite. A huddle of teenagers in pajamas was
arguing vociferously a little way along the path. When they saw Harry, Ron,
and Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, “Oü est
Madame Maxime? Nous l’avons perdue -“
“Er - what?” said Ron.
“Oh. . .“ The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they walked
on they distinctly heard her say, “Ogwarts.”
“Beauxbatons,” muttered Hermione.
“Sorry?” said Harry.
“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione. “You know... Beauxbatons
Academy of Magic. . . I read about it in An Appraisal ofMagical Education in
Europe.”
“Oh. . . yeah. . . right,” said Harry.
“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron, pulling out his wand,
lighting it like Hermione’s, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets
of his jacket for his own wand - but it wasn’t there. The only thing he could
find was his Omnioculars.
“Ah, no, I don’t believe it. . . I’ve lost my wand!”
“You’re kidding!”
Ron and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams
of light farther on the ground; Harry looked all around him, but his wand was
nowhere to be seen.
“Maybe it’s back in the tent,” said Ron.
“Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?” Hermione suggested
anxiously.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “maybe. .
He usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world, and
finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very
vulnerable.
A rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump. Winky the house-elf was
fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a most
peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though someone
invisible were trying to hold her back.
“There is bad wizards about!” she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward
and labored to keep running. “People high - high in the air! Winky is getting
out of the way!”
And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and
squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her.
“What’s up with her?” said Ron, looking curiously after Winky. “Why can’t
she run properly?”
“Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide,” said Harry. He was thinking of Dobby:
Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn’t like, the houseelf had been forced to start beating himself up.
“You know, house-elves get a very raw deal!” said Hermione indignantly. “It’s
slavery, that’s what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the
stadium, and she was terrified, and he’s got her bewitched so she can’t even run
when they start trampling tents! Why doesn’t anyone do something about it?”
“Well, the elves are happy, aren’t they?” Ron said. “You heard old Winky
back at the match.. . ‘House-elves is not supposed to have fun’. . . that’s what
she likes, being bossed around. . . .“
“It’s people like you, Ron,” Hermione began hotly, “who prop up rotten and
unjust systems, just because they’re too lazy to -“
Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.
“Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily
at Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps
Hermione was in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still
searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn’t there.
They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for
Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins who were cackling
over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and
who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther still
along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked
through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing,
surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very
loudly.
“I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!” one of them shouted.
“I’m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures.”
“No, you’re not!” yelled his friend. “You’re a dishwasher at the Leaky
Cauldron. . . . but I’m a vampire hunter, I’ve killed about ninety so far -“
A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light
of the veela, now cut in, “I’m about to become the youngest ever Minister of
Magic, I am.”
Harry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard: His name was
Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight Bus.
He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron’s face had gone oddly slack, and next second
Ron was yelling, “Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach
Jupiter?”
“Honestly!” said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the
arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of
the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of
the wood. They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.
Harry looked around. “I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We’ll hear
anyone coming a mile off.”
The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from
behind a tree right ahead of them.
Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change
had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there
was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.
“Who’s that?” he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces.
“What are you doing in here, all alone?”
They looked at one another, surprised.
“Well - there’s a sort of riot going on,” said Ron.
Bagman stared at him.
“What?”
“At the campsite. . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . .
Bagman swore loudly.
“Damn them!” he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he
Disapparated with a small pop!
“Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?” said Hermione, frowning.
“He was a great Beater, though,” said Ron, leading the way off the path into a
small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree.
“The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with
them.”
He took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground,
and watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duckfooted and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on
his broomstick. Harry was listening for noise from the campsite. Everything
seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.
“I hope the others are okay,” said Hermione after a while.
“They’ll be fine,” said Ron.
“Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,” said Harry, sitting down next to
Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves.
“He’s always said he’d like to get something on him.”
“That’d wipe the smirk off old Draco’s face, all right,” said Ron.
“Those poor Muggles, though,” said Hermione nervously. “What if they can’t
get them down?”
“They will,” said Ron reassuringly. “They’ll find a way.”
“Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic’s
out here tonight!” said Hermione. “I mean, how do they expect to get away
with it? Do you think they’ve been drinking, or are they just -“
But she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron looked
quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their
clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the
dark trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.
“Hello?” called Harry.
There was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too
dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the
range of his vision.
“Who’s there?” he said.
And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had
heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a
spell.
“MORSMORDRE!”
And something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness
Harry’s eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and
into the sky.
“What the - ?“ gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing
that had appeared.
For a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he
realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald
stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched,
it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against
the black sky like a new constellation.
Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn’t
understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the
skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some
grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the
skull, but he couldn’t see anyone.
“Who’s there?” he called again.
“Harry, come on, move!” Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was
tugging him backward.
“What’s the matter?” Harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified.
“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she
could. “You-Know-Who’s sign!”
“Voldemort’s - “Harry, come on!”
Harry turned - Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum - the three of
them started across the clearing - but before they had taken a few hurried steps,
a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing
from thin air, surrounding them.
Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of these
wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, Ron,
and Hermione.
Without pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!”
He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.
“STUPEFY!” roared twenty voices - there was a blinding series of flashes and
Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the
clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light
flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one another, bouncing off
tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness--
“Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! That’s my son!”
Harry’s hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher. The
wizard in front of him had lowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr.
Weasley striding toward them, looking terrified.
“Ron - Harry” - his voice sounded shaky - “Hermione - are you all right?”
“Out of the way, Arthur,” said a cold, curt voice.
It was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them.
Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch’s face was taut with rage.
“Which of you did it?” he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them.
“Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?”
“We didn’t do that!” said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.
“We didn’t do anything!” said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking
indignantly at his father. “What did you want to attack us for?”
“Do not lie, sir!” shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly at
Ron, and his eyes were popping - he looked slightly mad. “You have been
discovered at the scene of the crime!”
“Barty,” whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, “they’re kids,
Barty, they’d never have been able to
“Where did the Mark come from, you three?” said Mr. Weasley quickly.
“Over there,” said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had
heard the voice. “There was someone behind the trees. . . they shouted words -
an incantation -“
“Oh, stood over there, did they?” said Mr. Crouch, turning his popping eyes on
Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face. “Said an incantation, did they?
You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy -“
But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it
remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the
contrary, at Hermione’s words, they had all raised their wands again and were
pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.
“We’re too late,” said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head.
“They’ll have Disapparated.”
“I don’t think so,” said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard. It was Amos
Diggory, Cedric’s father. “Our Stunners went right through those trees. . . .
There’s a good chance we got them. . .
“Amos, be careful!” said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory
squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and
disappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched him vanish with her hands
over her mouth.
A few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.
“Yes! We got them! There’s someone here! Unconscious! It’s - but - blimey. .
“You’ve got someone?” shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding highly disbelieving.
“Who? Who is it?”
They heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching footsteps
as Mr. Diggory reemerged from behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp
figure in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at once. It was Winky.
Mr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory deposited his elf on the
ground at his feet. The other Ministry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch.
For a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white
face as he stared down at Winky. Then he appeared to come to life again.
“This - cannot - be,” he said jerkily. “No -“
He moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off toward the place where
he had found Winky.
“No point, Mr. Crouch,” Mr. Diggory called after him. “There’s no one else
there.”
But Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it. They could hear
him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside,
searching.
“Bit embarrassing,” Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at Winky’s
unconscious form. “Barty Crouch’s house-elf. . . I mean to say...”
“Come off it, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “you don’t seriously think it
was the elf? The Dark Mark’s a wizard’s sign. It requires a wand.”
“Yeah,” said Mr. Diggory, “and she had a wand.”
“What?” said Mr. Weasley.
“Here, look.” Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley. “Had
it in her hand. So that’s clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken, for a
start. No non-human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand.”
Just then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr.
Weasley. Looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot, goggling
upward at the emerald-green skull.
“The Dark Mark!” he panted, almost trampling Winky as he turned
inquiringly to his colleagues. “Who did it? Did you get them? Barry! What’s
going on?”
Mr. Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was still ghostly white, and
his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching.
“Where have you been, Barty?” said Bagman. “Why weren’t you at the match?
Your elf was saving you a seat too - gulping gargoyles!” Bagman had just
noticed Winky lying at his feet. “What happened to her?”
“I have been busy, Ludo,” said Mr. Crouch, still talking in the same jerky
fashion, barely moving his lips. “And my elf has been stunned.”
“Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why - ?“
Comprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman’s round, shiny face; he looked up
at the skull, down at Winky, and then at Mr. Crouch.
“No!” he said. “Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn’t know how!
She’d need a wand, for a start!”
“And she had one,” said Mr. Diggory. “I found her holding one, Ludo. If it’s
all right with you, Mr. Crouch, I think we should hear what she’s got to say for
herself.”
Crouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr. Diggory seemed to
take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and
said, “Ennervate!”
Winky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several
times in a bemused sort of way. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised
herself shakily into a sitting position.
She caught sight of Mr. Diggory’s feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her eyes
to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still, she looked up into the sky.
Harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy eyes.
She gave a gasp, looked wildly around the crowded clearing, and burst into
terrified sobs.
“Elf!” said Mr. Diggory sternly. “Do you know who I am? I’m a member of
the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!”
Winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground, her breath coming
in sharp bursts. Harry was reminded forcibly of Dobby in his moments of
terrified disobedience.
“As you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while ago,” said Mr.
Diggory. “And you were discovered moments later, right beneath it! An
explanation, if you please!”
“I - I - I is not doing it, sir!” Winky gasped. “I is not knowing how, sir!”
“You were found with a wand in your hand!” barked Mr. Diggory, brandishing
it in front of her. And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the
clearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it
“Hey - that’s mine!” he said
Everyone in the clearing looked at him.
“Excuse me?” said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.
“That’s my wand!” said Harry. “I dropped it!”
“You dropped it?” repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. “Is this a confession?
You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?”
“Amos, think who you’re talking to!” said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. “Is
Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark?”
“Er - of course not,” mumbled Mr. Diggory. “Sorry. . . carried away. .
“I didn’t drop it there, anyway,” said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the trees
beneath the skull. “I missed it right after we got into the wood.”
“So,” said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky
again, cowering at his feet. “You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it
up and thought you’d have some fun with it, did you?”
“I is not doing magic with it, sir!” squealed Winky, tears streaming down the
sides of her squashed and bulbous nose. “I is. . . I is. . . I is just picking it up,
sir! i is not making the Dark Mark, sir, i is not knowing how!”
“It wasn’t her!” said Hermione. She looked very nervous, speaking up in front
of all these Ministry wizards, yet determined all the same. “Winky’s got a
squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much
deeper!” She looked around at Harry and Ron, appealing for their support. “It
didn’t sound anything like Winky, did it?”
“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It definitely didn’t sound like an elf.”
“Yeah, it was a human voice,” said Ron.
“Well, we’ll soon see,” growled Mr. Diggory, looking unimpressed. “There’s a
simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know
that?”
Winky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr.
Diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with Harry’s.
“Prior Incantato!” roared Mr. Diggory.
Harry heard Hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpent-tongued skull
erupted from the point where the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of
the green skull high above them; it looked as though it were made of thick gray
smoke: the ghost of a spell.
“Deletrius!” Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of
smoke.
“So,” said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph, looking down upon
Winky, who was still shaking convulsively.
“I is not doing it!” she squealed, her eyes rolling in terror. “I is not, I is not, I is
not knowing how! I is a good elf, I isn’t using wands, I isn’t knowing how!”
“You’ve been caught red-handed, elf!” Mr. Diggory roared. “Caught with the
guilty wand in your hand!”
“Amos,” said Mr. Weasley loudly, “think about it. . . precious few wizards
know how to do that spell. . . . Where would she have learned it?”
“Perhaps Amos is suggesting,” said Mr. Crouch, cold anger in every syllable,
“that I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark?”
There was a deeply unpleasant silence. Amos Diggory looked horrified. “Mr.
Crouch.. . not. . . not at all.
“You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who
are least likely to conjure that Mark!” barked Mr. Crouch. “Harry Potter - and
myself. I suppose you are familiar with the boy’s story, Amos?”
“Of course - everyone knows -“ muttered Mr. Diggory, looking highly
discomforted.
“And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given, over a long career,
that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them?” Mr.
Crouch shouted, his eyes bulging again.
“Mr. Crouch, I - I never suggested you had anything to do with it!” Amos
Diggory muttered again, now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard.
“If you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!” shouted Mr. Crouch. “Where
else would she have learned to conjure it?”
“She - she might’ve picked it up anywhere -“
“Precisely, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley. “She might have picked it up
anywhere.. . . Winky?” he said kindly, turning to the elf, but she flinched as
though he too was shouting at her. “Where exactly did you find Harry’s wand?”
Winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying
beneath her fingers.
“I - I is finding it. . . finding it there, sir. . . .“ she whispered, “there . . . in the
trees, sir.
“You see, Amos?” said Mr. Weasley. “Whoever conjured the Mark could have
Disapparated right after they’d done it, leaving Harry’s wand behind. A clever
thing to do, not using their own wand, which could have betrayed them. And
Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick
it up.”
“But then, she’d have been only a few feet away from the real culprit!” said Mr.
Diggory impatiently. “Elf? Did you see anyone?”
Winky began to tremble worse than ever. Her giant eyes flickered from Mr.
Diggory, to Ludo Bagman, and onto Mr. Crouch. Then she gulped and said, “I
is seeing no one, sir. . . no one. .
“Amos,” said Mr. Crouch curtly, “I am fully aware that, in the ordinary course
of events, you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning.
I ask you, however, to allow me to deal with her.”
Mr. Diggory looked as though he didn’t think much of this suggestion at all, but
it was clear to Harry that Mr. Crouch was such an important member of the
Ministry that he did not dare refuse him.
“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr. Crouch added coldly.
“M-m-master. . .“ Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes
brimming with tears. “M-m-master, p-p-please. . .“
Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more
deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze.
“Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,”
he said slowly. “I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I
went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means
clothes.”
“No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch’s feet. “No, master!
Not clothes, not clothes!”
Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with
proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel
as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet.
“But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch.
“Your elf’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating
people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!”
Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf,
whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was
contaminating his over-shined shoes.
“I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he said coldly, looking over
at Hermione. “I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her
master, and to her master’s reputation.”
Winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing. There was
a very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly, “Well,
I think I’ll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody’s got any objections. Amos,
that wand’s told us all it can - if Harry could have it back, please -“
Mr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it.
“Come on, you three,” Mr. Weasley said quietly. But Hermione didn’t seem to
want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf. “Hermione!” Mr.
Weasley said, more urgently. She turned and followed Harry and Ron out of the
clearing and off through the trees.
“What’s going to happen to Winky?” said Hermione, the moment they had left
the clearing.
“I don’t know,” said Mr. Weasley.
“The way they were treating her!” said Hermione furiously. “Mr. Diggory,
calling her ‘elf’ all the time. . . and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn’t do it and
he’s still going to sack her! He didn’t care how frightened she’d been, or how
upset she was - it was like she wasn’t even human!”
“Well, she’s not,” said Ron.
Hermione rounded on him.
“That doesn’t mean she hasn’t got feelings, Ron. It’s disgusting the way -“
“Hermione, I agree with you,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, beckoning her on,
“but now is not the time to discuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as
fast as we can. What happened to the others?”
“We lost them in the dark,” said Ron. “Dad, why was everyone so uptight
about that skull thing?”
“I’ll explain everything back at the tent,” said Mr. Weasley tensely.
But when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was impeded. A
large crowd of frightened-looking witches and wizards was congregated there,
and when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them, many of them surged
forward.
“What’s going on in there?”
“Who conjured it?”
“Arthur - it’s not - Him?”
“Of course it’s not Him,” said Mr. Weasley impatiently. “We don’t know who
it was; it looks like they Disapparated. Now excuse me, please, I want to get to
bed.”
He led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the
campsite. All was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though
several ruined tents were still smoking.
Charlie’s head was poking out of the boys’ tent.
“Dad, what’s going on?” he called through the dark. “Fred, George, and Ginny
got back okay, but the others -“
“I’ve got them here,” said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the tent.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered after him.
Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which
was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was
sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.
“Did you get them, Dad?” said Bill sharply. “The person who conjured the
Mark?”
“No,” said Mr. Weasley. “We found Barry Crouch’s elf holding Harry’s wand,
but we’re none the wiser about who actually conured the Mark.”
“What?” said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together. “Harry’s wand?” said Fred.
“Mr. Crouch’s elf” said Percy, sounding thunderstruck.
With some assistance from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Mr. Weasley explained
what had happened in the woods. When they had finished their story, Percy
swelled indignantly.
“Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!” he said.
“Running away when he’d expressly told her not to. . . embarrassing him in
front of the whole Ministry. . . how would that have looked, if she’d been
brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control -“
“She didn’t do anything - she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!”
Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback. Hermione had
always got on fairly well with Percy - better, indeed, than any of the others.
“Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch’s position can’t afford a house-elf who’s
going to run amok with a wand!” said Percy pompously, recovering himself.
“She didn’t run amok!” shouted Hermione. “She just picked it up off the
ground!”
“Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?” said Ron
impatiently. “It wasn’t hurting anyone. . . . Why’s it such a big deal?”
“I told you, it’s You-Know-Who’s symbol, Ron,” said Hermione, before
anyone else could answer. “I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark
Arts.”
“And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years,” said Mr. Weasley quietly. “Of
course people panicked. . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back
again.”
“I don’t get it,” said Ron, frowning. “I mean. . . it’s still only a shape in the
sky. . .
“Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air
whenever they killed,” said Mr. Weasley. “The terror it inspired. . . you have
no idea, you’re too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark
Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you’re about to find inside.
. . .” Mr. Weasley winced. “Everyone’s worst fear. . . the very worst..
There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to
check on his cut, said, “Well, it didn’t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It
scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated
before we’d got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses
before they hit the ground, though. They’re having their memories modified
right now.”
“Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?”
“It’s what You-Know-Who’s supporters called themselves,” said Bill. “I think
we saw what’s left of them tonight - the ones who managed to keep themselves
out of Azkaban, anyway.”
“We can’t prove it was them, Bill,” said Mr. Weasley. “Though it probably
was,” he added hopelessly.
“Yeah, I bet it was!” said Ron suddenly . “Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the
woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks!
And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!”
“But what were Voldemort’s supporters -“ Harry began. Everybody flinched -
like most of the wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying
Voldemort’s name. “Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “What were You-KnowWho’s supporters up to, levitating Muggles? I mean, what was the point?”
“The point?” said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. “Harry, that’s their idea
of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were
done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn’t resist
reminding us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for
them,” he finished disgustedly.
“But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw
the Dark Mark?” said Ron. “They’d have been pleased to see it, wouldn’t
they?”
“Use your brains, Ron,” said Bill. “If they really were Death Eaters, they
worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power,
and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet
they’d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They
denied they’d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went
back to their daily lives. . . . I don’t reckon he’d be over-pleased with them, do
you?”
“So. . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark. . .“ said Hermione slowly, “were they
doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?”
“Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,” said Mr. Weasley. “But I’ll tell you
this. . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I’d be
very surprised if the person who did it hadn’t been a Death Eater once, even if
they’re not now. . Listen, it’s very late, and if your mother hears what’s
happened she’ll be worried sick. We’ll get a few more hours sleep and then try
and get an early Portkey out of here.”
Harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he ought to feel
exhausted: It was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake - wideawake, and worried.
Three days ago - it felt like much longer, but it had only been three days - he
had awoken with his scar burning. And tonight, for the first time in thirteen
years, Lord Voldemort’s mark had appeared in the sky. What did these things
mean?
He thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive.
Would Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up
at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and
it was a long time after Charlie’s snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed
off.
CHAPTER TEN – MAYHEM AT THE MINISTRY
Mr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used
magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible,
passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange,
dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague “Merry Christmas.”
“He’ll be all right,” said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off
onto the moor. “Sometimes, when a person’s memory’s modified, it makes him
a bit disorientated for a that was a big thing they had to make him
forget.”
They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the
Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches
and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to
get away from the campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried
discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old
rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked
back through Ottery St. Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in
the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted, and thinking
longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came
into view, a cry echoed along the lane.
“Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!”
Mrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard, came
running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and
strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in her hand.
“Arthur - I’ve been so worried - so worried-”
She flung her arms around Mr. Weasley’s neck, and the Daily Prophet fell out
of her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline:
SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a
twinkling black-and-white photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops.
“You’re all right,” Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing Mr. Weasley
and staring around at them all with red eyes, “you’re alive. . . . Oh boys. .
And to everybody’s surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled them both
into such a tight hug that their heads banged together.
“Ouch! Mum - you’re strangling us –“
“I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob. “It’s all
I’ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last
thing I ever said to you was that you didn’t get enough OW.L.s? Oh Fred. . .
George. .”
“Come on, now, Molly, we’re all perfectly okay,” said Mr. Weasley soothingly,
prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house. “Bill,” he
added in an undertone, “pick up that paper, I want to see what it says. . .”
When they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and Hermione had made
Mrs. Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on
pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhiskey, Bill handed his father the
newspaper. Mr. Weasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his
shoulder.
“I knew it,” said Mr. Weasley heavily. “Ministry blunders. . . culprits not
apprehended. . . lax security. . . Dark wizards running unchecked... national
disgrace. . . Who wrote this? Ah. . . of course. . . Rita Skeeter.”
“That woman’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!” said Percy furiously.
“Last week she was saying we’re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron
thickness, when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn’t
specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of
Non-Wizard Part-Humans --“
“Do us a favor, Perce,” said Bill, yawning, “and shut up.”
“I’m mentioned,” said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as he
reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article.
“Where?” spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whiskey. “If I’d
seen that, I’d have known you were alive!”
“Not by name,” said Mr. Weasley. “Listen to this: ‘If the terrified wizards and
witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected
reassurance from the Ministry ofMagic, they were sadly disappointed. A
Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark
alleging that nobody had been hurt, but reflising to give any more
information. Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that
several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be
seen.’ Oh really,” said Mr. Weasley in exasperation, handing the paper to
Percy. “Nobody was hurt. What was I supposed to say? Rumors that several
bodies were removed from the woods. . . well, there certainly will be rumors
now she’s printed that.”
He heaved a deep sigh. “Molly, I’m going to have to go into the office; this is
going to take some smoothing over.”
“I’ll come with you, Father,” said Percy importantly. “Mr. Crouch will need all
hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person.”
He bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset. “Arthur,
you’re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn’t got anything to do with your
office; surely they can handle this without you?”
“I’ve got to go, Molly,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’ve made things worse. I’ll just
change into my robes and I’ll be off. . . .“
“Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, “Hedwig
hasn’t arrived with a letter for me, has she?”
“Hedwig, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. “No. . . no, there hasn’t been
any post at all.”
Ron and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at both
of them he said, “All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?”
“Yeah. . . think I will too,” said Ron at once. “Hermione?”
“Yes,” she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and
up the stairs.
“What’s up, Harry?” said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic
room behind them.
“There’s something I haven’t told you,” Harry said. “On Saturday morning, I
woke up with my scar hurting again.”
Ron’s and Hermione’s reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined
them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started
making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and
everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse.
Ron simply looked dumbstruck.
“But - he wasn’t there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean - last time your scar
kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn’t he?”
“I’m sure he wasn’t on Privet Drive,” said Harry. “But I was dreaming about
him.. . him and Peter - you know, Wormtail. I can’t remember all of it now, but
they were plotting to kill...someone.”
He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying “me,” but couldn’t bring
himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did.
“It was only a dream,” said Ron bracingly. “Just a nightmare.”
“Yeah, but was it, though?” said Harry, turning to look out of the window at
the brightening sky. “It’s weird, isn’t it?. . . My scar hurts, and three days later
the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort’s sign’s up in the sky again.”
“Don’t - say - his - name!” Ron hissed through gritted teeth.
“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?” Harry went on, ignoring
Ron. “At the end of last year?”
Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts. Hermione’s
terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.
“Oh Harry, you aren’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?”
“You weren’t there,” said Harry. “You didn’t hear her. This time was different.
I told you, she went into a trance - a real one. And she said the Dark Lord
would rise again. . . greater and more terrible than ever before. . . and he’d
manage it because his servant was going to go back to him. . . and that night
Wormtail escaped.”
There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his
Chudley Cannons bedspread.
“Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?” Hermione asked. “Are
you expecting a letter?”
“I told Sirius about my scar,” said Harry, shrugging. “I’m waiting for his
answer.”
“Good thinking!” said Ron, his expression clearing. “I bet Sirius’ll know what
to do!”
“I hoped he’d get back to me quickly,” said Harry.
“But we don’t know where Sirius is. . . he could be in Africa or somewhere,
couldn’t he?” said Hermione reasonably. “Hedwig’s not going to manage that
journey in a few days.”
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he
looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.
“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry” said Ron. “Come
on - three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play. .. . You can
try out the Wronski Feint... .“
“Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re-being-very-sensitive sort of
voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now... . He’s worried, and
he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to
“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry suddenly. “Hang on, I’ll get my
Firebolt.”
Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like
“Boys.”
Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week.
Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and
returned well after dinner every night.
“It’s been an absolute uproar,” Percy told them importantly the Sunday evening
before they were due to return to Hogwarts. “I’ve been putting out fires all
week. People keep sending Howlers, and of course, if you don’t open a Howler
straight away, it explodes. Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill
reduced to cinders.”
“Why are they all sending Howlers?” asked Ginny, who was mending her copy
of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in
front of the living room fire.
“Complaining about security at the World Cup,” said Percy. “They want
compensation for their ruined property. Mundungus Fletcher’s put in a claim
for a twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I’ve got his number. I
know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.”
Mrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner. Harry liked this
clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise
very informative. It had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved
with one of the Weasley family’s names. There were no numerals around the
face, but descriptions of where each family member might be. “Home,”
“school,” and “work” were there, but there was also “traveling,” “lost,”
“hospital,” “prison,” and, in the position where the number twelve would be on
a normal clock, “mortal peril.”
Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the “home” position, but Mr.
Weasley’s, which was the longest, was still pointing to “work.” Mrs. Weasley
sighed.
“Your father hasn’t had to go into the office on weekends since the days of
You-Know-Who,” she said. “They’re working him far too hard. His dinner’s
going to be ruined if he doesn’t come home soon.”
“Well, Father feels he’s got to make up for his mistake at the match, doesn’t
he?” said Percy. “If truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public
statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first -“
“Don’t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman
wrote!” said Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once.
“If Dad hadn’t said anything, old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful
that nobody from the Ministry had commented,” said Bill, who was playing
chess with Ron. “Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good. Remember, she
interviewed all the Gringotts’ Charm Breakers once, and called me ‘a longhaired pillock’?”
“Well, it is a bit long, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley gently. “If you’d just let me -“
“No, Mum.”
Rain lashed against the living room window. Hermione was immersed in The
Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had bought
for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley. Charlie was darning a fireproof
balaclava. Harry was polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit
Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet. Fred and
George were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads
bent over a piece of parchment.
“What are you two up to?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes on the twins.
“Homework,” said Fred vaguely.
“Don’t be ridiculous, you’re still on holiday,” said Mrs. Weasley.
“Yeah, we’ve left it a bit late,” said George.
“You’re not by any chance writing out a new order form, are you?” said Mrs.
Weasley shrewdly. “You wouldn’t be thinking of restarting Weasleys’ Wizard
Wheezes, by any chance?”
“Now, Mum,” said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face. “If the
Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow, and George and I died, how would you
feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded
accusation?”
Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley.
“Oh your father’s coming!” she said suddenly, looking up at the clock again.
Mr. Weasley’s hand had suddenly spun from “work” to “traveling”; a second
later it had shuddered to a halt on “home” with the others, and they heard him
calling from the kitchen.
“Coming, Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying out of the room.
A few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the warm living room carrying his
dinner on a tray. He looked completely exhausted.
“Well, the fat’s really in the fire now,” he told Mrs. Weasley as he sat down in
an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat
shriveled cauliflower. “Rita Skeeter’s been ferreting around all week, looking
for more Ministry mess-ups to report. And now she’s found out about poor old
Bertha going missing, so that’ll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow. I told
Bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago.”
“Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks,” said Percy swiftly.
“Crouch is very lucky Rita hasn’t found out about Winky,” said Mr. Weasley
irritably. “There’d be a week’s worth of headlines in his house-elf being caught
holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark.”
“I thought we were all agreed that that elf, while irresponsible, did not conjure
the Mark?” said Percy hotly.
“If you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows
how mean he is to elves!” said Hermione angrily.
“Now look here, Hermione!” said Percy. “A high-ranking Ministry official like
Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants –“
“His slave, you mean!” said Hermione, her voice rising passionately, “because
he didn’t pay Winky, did he?”
“I think you’d all better go upstairs and check that you’ve packed properly!”
said Mrs. Weasley, breaking up the argument. “Come on now, all of you. . . .“
Harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his Firebolt over his shoulder,
and went back upstairs with Ron. The rain sounded even louder at the top of
the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to
mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic. Pigwidgeon
began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered. The sight of
the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement.
“Bung him some Owl Treats,” said Ron, throwing a packet across to Harry. “It
might shut him up.”
Harry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon’s cage, then
turned to his trunk. Hedwig’s cage stood next to it, still empty.
“It’s been over a week,” Harry said, looking at Hedwig’s deserted perch. “Ron,
you don’t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?”
“Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said Ron. “The Ministry would
want to show they’d caught someone, wouldn’t they?”
“Yeah, I suppose. . . .“
“Look, here’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley. And she’s got some
gold out of your vault for you. . . and she’s washed all your socks.”
He heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry’s camp bed and dropped the money bag
and a load of socks next to it. Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart
from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a
handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potionmaking kit - he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of bel-
ladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a
loud noise of disgust behind him.
“What is that supposed to be?”
He was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long, maroon velvet
dress. It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs.
There was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley entered, carrying an armful
of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes.
“Here you are,” she said, sorting them into two piles. “Now, mind you pack
them properly so they don’t crease.”
“Mum, you’ve given me Ginny’s new dress,” said Ron, handing it out to her.
“Of course I haven’t,” said Mrs. Weasley. “That’s for you. Dress robes.”
“What?” said Ron, looking horror-struck.
“Dress robes!” repeated Mrs. Weasley. “It says on your school list that you’re
supposed to have dress robes this year. . . robes for formal occasions.”
“You’ve got to be kidding,” said Ron in disbelief. “I’m not wearing that, no
way.”
“Everyone wears them, Ron!” said Mrs. Weasley crossly. “They’re all like that!
Your father’s got some for smart parties!”
“I’ll go starkers before I put that on,” said Ron stubbornly.
“Don’t be so silly,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’ve got to have dress robes, they’re
on your list! I got some for Harry too. . . show him, Harry... .“
In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn’t as
bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn’t have any lace on them
at all - in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that
they were bottle green instead of black.
“I thought they’d bring out the color of your eyes, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley
fondly.
“Well, they’re okay!” said Ron angrily, looking at Harry’s robes. “Why
couldn’t I have some like that?”
“Because. . . well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn’t a lot of
choice!” said Mrs. Weasley, flushing.
Harry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his
Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it.
“I’m never wearing them,” Ron was saying stubbornly. “Never.”
“Fine,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “Go naked. And, Harry, make sure you get a
picture of him. Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.”
She left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny spluttering
noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.
“Why is everything I own rubbish?” said Ron furiously, striding across the
room to unstick Pigwidgeon’s beak.
CHAPTER ELEVEN – ABOARD THE HOGWART EXPRESS
There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air when
Harry awoke next morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window
as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school
robes on the Hogwarts Express.
He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing
on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the
stairs, looking harassed.
“Arthur!” she called up the staircase. “Arthur! Urgent message
from the Ministry!”
Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came
clattering past with his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of sight. When
Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging
anxiously in the drawers - “I’ve got a quill here somewhere!” - and Mr.
Weasley bending over the fire, talking to –
Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were
working properly.
Amos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large,
bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks
flying around it and the flames licking its ears.
“. . . Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those
what-d’you-call-’ems - please-men. Arthur, you’ve got to get over there --“
“Here!” said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle
of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley’s hands.
“- it’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,” said Mr. Diggory’s head. “I had to
come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper
Use of Magic lot all setting off -- if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur --“
“What does Mad-Eye say happened?” asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink
bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.
Mr. Diggory’s head rolled its eyes. “Says he heard an intruder in his yard. Says
he was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed by his dustbins.”
“What did the dustbins do?” asked Mr. Weasley, scribbling frantically.
“Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as I can tell,”
said Mr. Diggory. “Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the
please-men turned up -“
Mr. Weasley groaned.
“And what about the intruder?”
“Arthur, you know Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Diggory’s head, rolling its eyes again.
“Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night? More likely there’s a
very shell-shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in potato
peelings. But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad-Eye,
he’s had it -- think of his record -- we’ve got to get him off on a minor charge,
something in your department -- what are exploding dustbins worth?”
“Might be a caution,” said Mr. Weasley, still writing very fast, his brow
furrowed. “Mad-Eye didn’t use his wand? He didn’t actually attack anyone?”
“I’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach
through the window,” said Mr. Diggory, “but they’ll have a job proving it, there
aren’t any casualties.”
“All right, I’m off,” Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment with his
notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again.
Mr. Diggory’s head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.
“Sorry about this, Molly,” it said, more calmly, “bothering you so early and
Arthur’s the only one who can get Mad-Eye off, and MadEye’s supposed to be starting his new job today. Why he had to choose last
night. .”
“Never mind, Amos,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sure you won’t have a bit of toast or
anything before you go?”
“Oh go on, then,” said Mr. Diggory.
Mrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table,
put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into Mr. Diggory’s mouth.
“Fanks,” he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop, vanished.
Harry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-byes to Bill, Charlie, Percy,
and the girls. Within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the
right way now, dragging a comb through his hair.
“I’d better hurry - you have a good term, boys, said Mr. Weasley to Harry, Ron,
and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to
Disapparate. “Molly, are you going to be all right taking the kids to King’s
Cross?”
“Of course I will,” she said. “You just look after Mad-Eye, we’ll be fine.”
As Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.
“Did someone say Mad-Eye?” Bill asked. “What’s he been up to now.”
“He says someone tried to break into his house last night,” said Mrs. Weasley.
“Mad-Eye Moody?” said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his
toast. “Isn’t he that nutter -“
“Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,” said Mrs. Weasley
sternly.
“Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn’t he?” said Fred quietly as Mrs.
Weasley left the room. “Birds of a feather. . .“
“Moody was a great wizard in his time,” said Bill.
“He’s an old friend of Dumbledore’s, isn’t he?” said Charlie.
“Dumbledore’s not what you’d call normal, though, is he?” said Fred. “I
mean, I know he’s a genius and everything.. .“
“Who is Mad-Eye?” asked Harry.
“He’s retired, used to work at the Ministry,” said Charlie. “I met him once
when Dad took me into work with him. He was an Auror - one of the best. . . a
Dark wizard catcher,” he added, seeing Harry’s blank look “Half the cells in
Azkaban are full because of him. He made himself loads of enemies, though. . .
the families of people he caught, mainly. . . and I heard he’s been getting really
paranoid in his old age. Doesn’t trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark wizards
everywhere.”
Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King’s Cross station,
but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.
“I just can’t justify taking more time off at the moment,” he told them. “Mr.
Crouch is really starting to rely on me.”
“Yeah, you know what, Percy?” said George seriously. “I reckon he’ll know
your name soon.”
Mrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three
ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.
“Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,” Mrs. Weasley whispered to Harry
as they stood in the rain-washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six
heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. “But there weren’t any to spare. . . . Oh
dear, they don’t look happy, do they?”
Harry didn’t like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely
transported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting
racket. Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster’s Fabulous No-Heat, WetStart Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred’s trunk sprang open, causing
the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his
way up the man’s leg.
The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the
back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover
from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione were all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at
King’s Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they
got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.
Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. It was
a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing
platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive
way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups today;
Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied
by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the
barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it. . . and as they did
so, platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their
luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Charlie, grinning, as he
hugged Ginny good-bye.
“Why?” said Fred keenly.
“You’ll see,” said Charlie. “Just don’t tell Percy I mentioned it.. . it’s ‘classified
information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it,’ after all.”
“Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year,” said Bill, hands in his
pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.
“Why?” said George impatiently.
“You’re going to have an interesting year,” said Bill, his eyes twinkling. “I
might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it.”
“A bit of what?” said Ron.
But at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them toward
the train doors.
“Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,” said Hermione as they climbed
on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her.
“Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry.
“Oh it was my pleasure, dears,” said Mrs. Weasley. “I’d invite you for
Christmas, I expect you’re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts,
what with. . . one thing and another.”
“Mum!” said Ron irritably. “What d’you three know that we don’t?”
“You’ll find out this evening, I expect,” said Mrs. Weasley, smiling. “It’s going
to be very exciting - mind you, I’m very glad they’ve changed the rules –“
“What rules?” said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George together.
“I’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. . . . Now, behave, won’t you?
Won’t you, Fred? And you, George?”
The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.
“Tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts!” Fred bellowed out of the window as
Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from them. “What rules are they
changing?”
But Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had rounded the
corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment. The thick rain
splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid his
trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon’s
cage to muffle his hooting.
“Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts,” he said grumpily,
sitting down next to Harry. “At the World Cup, remember? But my own
mother won’t say. Wonder what --“
“Shh!” Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and
pointing toward the compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened, and
heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.
“. . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than
Hogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his
opinion of Dumbledore - the man’s such a Mudblood-lover - and Durmstrang
doesn’t admit that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn’t like the idea of me going
to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line
than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually learn them,
not just the defense rubbish we do. . . .“
Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out
Malfoy’s voice.
“So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?” she said angrily.
“I wish he had gone, then we wouldn’t have to put up with him.”
“Durmstrang’s another wizarding school?” said Harry.
“Yes,” said Hermione sniffily, “and it’s got a horrible reputation. According to
An Appraisal ofMagical Education in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the
Dark Arts.”
“I think I’ve heard of it,” said Ron vaguely. “Where is it? What country?”
“Well, nobody knows, do they?” said Hermione, raising her eyebrows.
“Er - why not?” said Harry.
“There’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools.
Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can
steal their secrets,” said Hermione matter-of-factly.
“Come off it,” said Ron, starting to laugh. “Durmstrang’s got to be about the
same size as Hogwarts -- how are you going to hide a great big castle?”
“But Hogwarts is hidden,” said Hermione, in surprise. “Everyone knows that..
. well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.”
“Just you, then,” said Ron. “So go on - how d’you hide a place like
Hogwarts?”
“It’s bewitched,” said Hermione. “If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a
moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT
ENTER, UNSAFE.”
“So Durmstrang’ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?”
“Maybe,” said Hermione, shrugging, “or it might have Muggle-repelling
charms on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from
finding it, they’ll have made it Unplottable -“
“Come again?”
“Well, you can enchant a building so it’s impossible to plot on a map, can’t
you?”
“Er. . . if you say so,” said Harry.
“But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,” said Hermione
thoughtfully. “Somewhere very cold, because they’ve got fur capes as part of
their uniforms.”
“Ah, think of the possibilities,” said Ron dreamily. “It would’ve been so easy to
push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident... . Shame his
mother likes him. . . .“
The rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north. The sky
was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday.
The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry bought a large
stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share.
Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including
Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round-faced,
extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a
grandmother. Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic
seemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking “Troy - Mullet - Moran!”
but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour or so,
Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more
in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a
Summoning Charm.
Neville listened jealously to the others’ conversation as they relived the Cup
match.
“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably. “Wouldn’t buy tickets. It sounded
amazing though.”
“It was,” said Ron. “Look at this, Neville. . .
He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature
figure of Viktor Krum.
“Oh wow,” said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.
“We saw him right up close, as well,” said Ron. “We were in the Top Box -“
“For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.”
Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood Crabbe and
Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown
at least a foot during the summer. Evidently they had overheard the
conversation through the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had left
ajar.
“Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,” said Harry coolly.
“Weasley. . . what is that?” said Malfoy, pointing at Pigwidgeon’s cage. A
sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of
the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.
Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him; he
seized the sleeve and pulled.
“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes and showing
Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were
you? I mean - they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety. . .
“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched
them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe
and Goyle guffawed stupidly.
“So. . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the
family name? There’s money involved as well, you know. . . you’d be able to
afford some decent robes if you won. . . .“
“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.
‘Are you going to enter?’ Malfoy repeated. “I suppose you will, Potter? You
never miss a chance to show off, do you?”
“Either explain what you’re on about or go away, Malfoy,” said Hermione
testily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.
A gleeful smile spread across Malfoy’s pale face
“Don’t tell me you don’t know?” he said delightedly. “You’ve got a father and
brother at the Ministry and you don’t even know? My God, my father told me
about it ages ago. . . heard it from Cornelius Fudge. But then, Father’s always
associated with the top people at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father’s too
junior to know about it, Weasley. . . yes. . . they probably don’t talk about
important stuff in front of him. . . .“
Laughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle, and the three of
them disappeared.
Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind
them that the glass shattered.
“Ron!” said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered
“Reparo!” and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the
door.
“Well.. . making it look like he knows everything and we don’t.. . .“ Ron
snarled. “Father’s always associated with the top peopie at the Ministry.’. . .
Dad could’ve got a promotion any time... he just likes it where he is. . . .“
“Of course he does,” said Hermione quietly. “Don’t let Malfoy get to you, Ron
-“
“Him! Get to me!? As if!” said Ron, picking up one of the remaining
Cauldron Cakes and squashing it into a pulp.
Ron’s bad mood continued for the rest of the journey. He didn’t talk much as
they changed into their school robes, and was still glowering when the
Hogwarts Express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitch-darkness
of Hogsmeade station.
As the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead. Hermione
bundled up Crookshanks in her cloak and Ron left his dress robes over
Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against the
downpour. The rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as
though buckets of ice-cold water were being emptied repeatedly over their
heads.
“Hi, Hagrid!” Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the
platform.
“All righ’, Harry?” Hagrid bellowed back, waving. “See yeh at the feast if we
don’ drown!”
First years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by sailing across the lake with
Hagrid.
“Oooh, I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest
of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the
station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into one of
them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the
long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track
toward Hogwarts Castle.
CHAPTER TWELVE – THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT
Through the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the
sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast
becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts
coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the
thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a
halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone
steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up
the stone steps into the castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down
from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were
safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble
staircase.
“Blimey,” said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, “if that keeps up the lake’s going to overflow. I’m soak - ARRGH!”
A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto
Ron’s head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways
into Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped - narrowly missing Hermione,
it burst at Harry’s feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his
socks. People all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their
efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty
feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and
orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took
aim again.
“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at ONCE!”
Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House,
had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and
grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.
“Ouch - sorry, Miss Granger -“
“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.
“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor McGonagall, straightening
her pointed hat and glaring upward through her square-rimmed spectacles.
“Not doing nothing!” cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifthyear girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. “Already wet, aren’t
they? Little squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!” And he aimed another bomb at a group
of second years who had just arrived.
“I shall call the headmaster!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “I’m warning
you, Peeves –“
Peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air, and
zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely.
“Well, move along, then!” said Professor McGonagall sharply to the
bedraggled crowd. “Into the Great Hall, come on!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through
the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he
pushed his sopping hair off his face.
The Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the start-of-term
feast. Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds
of candles, floating over the tables in midair. The four long House tables were
packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one
side of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the
Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the
Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly white and
semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a
particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive,
and insuring that his head didn’t wobble too much on his partially severed neck.
“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.
“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water.
“Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I’m starving.”
The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every
school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t
been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just
then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.
“Hiya, Harry!”
It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.
“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.
“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother
Dennis!”
“Er - good,” said Harry.
“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat.
“I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”
“Er - yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and
Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses,
don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had
been put into Gryffindor.
“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw,
and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t you?”
Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty seats
there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake
with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervising the
drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and
Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted
more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor Lupin, who
had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table. There was
definitely no new face there.
“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.
Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout,
the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair. She
was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor
Sinistra’s other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions
master, Snape - Harry’s least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry’s loathing of
Snape was matched only by Snape’s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if
possible, intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under
Snape’s overlarge nose - Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their own
school days.
On Snape’s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor
McGonagall’s. Next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat Professor
Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the
candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and
moons. The tips of Dumbledore’s long, thin fingers were together and he was
resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon
spectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced up at the ceiling too. It was
enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this
stormy. Black and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another
thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it.
“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, beside Harry, “I could eat a hippogriff.”
The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall
opened and silence fell. Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first
years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and Hermione were wet, it was
nothing to how these first years looked. They appeared to have swum across the
lake rather than sailed. All of them were shivering with a combination of cold
and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing
the rest of the school - all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with
mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid’s moleskin
overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped
in a furry black circus tent. His small face protruded from over the collar,
looking almost painfully excited. When he had lined up with his terrifiedlooking peers, he caught Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and
mouthed, I fell in the lake! He looked positively delighted about it.
Professor McGonagall now placed a three-legged stool on the ground before the
first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty patched wizard’s hat. The
first years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was silence.
Then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into
song:
A thousand years or more ago,
When I was newly sewn,
There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known:
Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,
Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,
Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,
Shrewd Slytherin, from fin.
They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,
They hatched a daring plan
To educate young sorcerers
Thus Hogwarts School began.
Now each of these four founders
Formed their own house, for each
Did value different virtues
In the ones they had to teach.
By Gryffindor, the bravest were
Prized far beyond the rest;
For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
Most worthy of admission;
And power-hungry Slytherin
Loved those of great ambition.
While still alive they did divide
Their favorites from the throng,
Yet how to pick the worthy ones
When they were dead and gone?
‘Twas Gryffindor who found the way,
He whipped me off his head
The founders put some brains in me
So I could choose instead!
Now slip me snug about your ears,
I’ve never yet been wrong,
I’ll have a look inside your mind
And tell where you belong!
The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.
“That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,” said Harry, clapping along with
everyone else.
“Sings a different one every year,” said Ron. “It’s got to be a pretty boring life,
hasn’t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one.”
Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment.
“When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool,” she
told the first years. “When the hat announces your House, you will go and sit at
the appropriate table.
“Ackerley, Stewart!”
A boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot, picked up the
Sorting Hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.
“RAVENCLAW!” shouted the hat.
Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw
table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the
Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting
second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.
“Baddock, Malcolm!”
“SLYTHERIN!”
The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see
Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether
Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and
wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat
down.
“Branstone, Eleanor!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
“Cauldwell, Owen!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
“Creevey, Dennis!”
Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid’s moleskin, just
as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table.
About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid,
with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming - a
misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a
very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table
and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim
opened wide-- -
“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted.
Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely,
took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother.
“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat. “It was
brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the
boat!”
“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly. “It was probably the giant squid,
Dennis!”
“Wow!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for
more than being thrown into a storm-tossed, fathoms-deep lake, and pushed out
of it again by a giant sea monster.
“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and
glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?”
Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma
Dobbs.
The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their
faces moving one by one to the three-legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as
Professor McGonagall passed the L’s.
“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.
“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said Nearly
Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff.
“Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.
“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said Nearly
Headless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor
table. “We don’t want to break our winning streak, do we?”
Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years in a
row.
“Pritchard, Graham!”
“SLYTHERIN!”
“Quirke, Orla!”
“RAVENCLAW!”
And finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!” (“HUFFLEPUFF!”), the
Sorting ended. Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and
carried them away.
“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking
expectantly at his golden plate.
Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling
around at the students, his arms opened wide in welcome.
“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them, his deep voice
echoing around the Hall. “Tuck in.”
“Hear, hear!” said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty dishes filled
magically before their eyes.
Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and Hermione
loaded their own plates.
“Aaah, ‘at’s be’er,” said Ron, with his mouth full of mashed potato.
“You’re lucky there’s a feast at all tonight, you know,” said Nearly Headless
Nick. “There was trouble in the kitchens earlier.”
“Why? Wha’ ‘appened?” said Harry, through a sizable chunk of steak.
“Peeves, of course,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shaking his head, which
wobbled dangerously. He pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck. “The
usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast - well, it’s quite out of
the question, you know what he’s like, utterly uncivilized, can’t see a plate of
food without throwing it. We held a ghost’s council - the Fat Friar was all for
giving him the chance - but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put
his foot down.”
The Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent specter covered in
silver bloodstains. He was the only person at Hogwarts who could really
control Peeves.
“Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something,” said Ron
darkly. “So what did he do in the kitchens?”
“Oh the usual,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging. “Wreaked havoc and
mayhem. Pots and pans everywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified the
house-elves out of their wits--“
Clang.
Hermione had knocked over her golden goblet. Pumpkin juice spread steadily
over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen orange, but Hermione
paid no attention.
“There are house-elves here?” she said, staring, horror-struck, at Nearly
Headless Nick. “Here at Hogwarts?”
“Certainly,” said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her reaction.
“The largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe. Over a hundred.”
“I’ve never seen one!” said Hermione.
“Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?” said Nearly
Headless Nick. “They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning.. . see to the fires
and so on.. . . I mean, you’re not supposed to see them, are you? That’s the
mark of a good house-elf, isn’t it, that you don’t know it’s there?”
Hermione stared at him.
“But they get paid?” she said. “They get holidays, don’t they? And - and sick
leave, and pensions, and everything?”
Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head
flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still
attached it to his neck.
“Sick leave and pensions?” he said, pushing his head back onto his shoulders
and securing it once more with his ruff. “House-elves don’t want sick leave and
pensions!”
Hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put her knife
and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her.
“Oh c’mon, ‘Er-my-knee,” said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with bits of
Yorkshire pudding. “Oops -- sorry, ‘Arry --“ He swallowed. “You won’t get
them sick leave by starving yourself!”
“Slave labor,” said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose. “That’s what
made this dinner. Slave labor.”
And she refused to eat another bite.
The rain was still drumming heavily against the high, dark glass. Another clap
of thunder shook the windows, and the stormy ceiling flashed, illuminating the
golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced,
instantly, with puddings.
“Treacle tart, Hermione!” said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell toward her.
“Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!”
But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall that he
gave up.
When the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off
the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet
again. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at once, so that only
the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard.
“So!” said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all. “Now that we are all fed
and watered,” (“Hmph!” said Hermione) “I must once more ask for your
attention, while I give out a few notices.
“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects
forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming
Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list
comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be
viewed in Mr. Filch’s office, if anybody would like to check it.”
The corners of Dumbledore’s mouth twitched. He continued, “As ever, I would
like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to students,
as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.
“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch Cup
will not take place this year.”
“What?” Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow
members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at
Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbhedore went on, “This is
due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the
school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and energy - but I am sure
you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this
year at Hogwarts -“
But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of
the Great Hall banged open.
A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black
traveling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger,
suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the
ceiling. He lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray
hair, then began to walk up toward the teachers’ table.
A dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He reached the
end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore.
Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling. Hermione gasped.
The lightning had thrown the man’s face into sharp relief, and it was a face
unlike any Harry had ever seen. It looked as though it had been carved out of
weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human
faces are supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel. Every
inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and
a large chunk of the nose was missing. But it was the man’s eyes that made him
frightening.
One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a coin,
and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without
blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently
of the normal eye - and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the
man’s head, so that all they could see was whiteness.
The stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a hand that was as badly
scarred as his face, and Dumbhedore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn’t
hear. He seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who shook his
head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone. Dumbledore nodded and
gestured the man to the empty seat on his right-hand side.
The stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face, pulled
a plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed
it. He then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of
it, and began to eat. His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue
eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the
students.
“May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said
Dumbledore brightly into the silence. “Professor Moody.”
It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the
staff or students chapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid, who both put their
hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the silence,
and they stopped fairly quickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by
Moody’s bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him.
“Moody?” Harry muttered to Ron. “Mad-Eye Moody? The one your dad
went to help this morning?”
“Must be,” said Ron in a low, awed voice.
“What happened to him?” Hermione whispered. “What happened to his
face?”
“Dunno,” Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.
Moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome. Ignoring the
jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak,
pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it. As he lifted his arm to
drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below
the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.
Dumbledore cleared his throat.
“As I was saying,” he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of
whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, “we are to have the
honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that
has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you
that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.”
“You’re JOKING!” said Fred Weasley loudly.
The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody’s arrival suddenly broke.
Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I did
hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun
who all go into a bar.
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er - but maybe this is not the time.. . no. . .“ said Dumbledore, “where was I?
Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament. . . well, some of you will not know what
this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for
giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years,
and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties
between young witches and wizards of different nationalities - until, that is, the
death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.”
“Death toll?” Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not
seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them were
whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was far more interested
in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had
happened hundreds of years ago.
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the
tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very successful.
However, our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and
Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt.
We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion
will find himself or herself in mortal danger.
“The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their shortlisted contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take
place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most
worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a
thousand Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only person
who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At every
House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else
whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and
the Hall quieted once more.
“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to
Hogwarts,” he said, “the heads of the participating schools, along with the
Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this
year. Only students who are of age - that is to say, seventeen years or older -
will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This” --
Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of
outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious -
“is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be
difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely
that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will
personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge
into making them Hog-warts champion.” His light blue eyes twinkled as they
flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I therefore beg you not to
waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.
“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in
October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you
will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and
will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she
is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be
alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop
chop!”
Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There was
a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed
toward the double doors into the entrance hall.
“They can’t do that!” said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd
moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore.
“We’re seventeen in April, why can’t we have a shot?”
“They’re not stopping me entering,” said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the
top table. “The champions’ll get to do all sorts of stuff you’d never be allowed
to do normally. And a thousand Galleons prize money!”
“Yeah,” said Ron, a faraway look on his face. “Yeah, a thousand Galleons. . .“
“Come on,” said Hermione, “we’ll be the only ones left here if you don’t
move.”
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and
George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were
under seventeen from entering the tournament.
“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the champions are?”
said Harry.
“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of
drops of Aging Potion might do it, George.. .”
“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said Ron.
“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?” said
Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter,
he’ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are.
Dumbledore’s trying to stop us giving our names.”
“People have died, though!” said Hermione in a worried voice as they walked
through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower
staircase.
“Yeah,” said Fred airily, “but that was years ago, wasn’t it? Anyway, where’s
the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get ‘round
Dumbledore? Fancy entering?”
“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to enter, wouldn’t it? But I
s’pose they might want someone older.... Dunno if we’ve learned enough.. .
“I definitely haven’t,” came Nevihle’s gloomy voice from behind Fred and
George.
“I expect my gran’d want me to try, though. She’s always going on about how
I should be upholding the family honor. I’ll just have to -- oops. . .”
Neville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There
were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the
older students to jump this particular step, but Neville’s memory was
notoriously poor. Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him
out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing
wheezily.
“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed. They made
their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, which was concealed behind
a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress.
“Password?” she said as they approached.
“Balderdash,” said George, “a prefect downstairs told me.”
The portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all
climbed. A crackling fire warmed the circular common room, which was full of
squashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark
look, and Harry distinctly heard her mutter “Slave labor” before bidding them
good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls’ dormitory.
Harry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached
their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower. Five fourposter beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with its
owner’s trunk at the foot. Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed;
Seamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard, and Dean had tacked
up a poster of Viktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster of the West
Ham football team was pinned right next to it.
“Mental,” Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer
players.
Harry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed. Someone - a
house-elf, no doubt - had placed warming pans between the sheets. It was
extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging
outside.
“I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily through the darkness, “if
Fred and George find out how to. . . the tournament. . . you never know, do
you?”
“S’pose not. .. .“
Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind’s
eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was
seventeen. . . he had become Hogwarts champion. . . he was standing on the
grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom
were applauding and screaming. . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament.
Cho’s face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing
with admiration....
Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn’t see what he
could.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN – MAD-EYE MOODY
The storm had blown itself out by the following morning, though the
ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled
overhead as Harry, Ron, and Hermione examined their new course schedules at
breakfast. A few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing
magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard
Tournament.
“Today’s not bad.. . outside all morning,” said Ron, who was
running his finger down the Monday column of his schedule. “Herbology with
the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures... damn it, we’re still with the
Slytherins. . . .“
“Double Divination this afternoon,” Harry groaned, looking down.
Divination was his least favorite subject, apart from Potions. Professor
Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying.
“You should have given it up like me, shouldn’t you?” said
Hermione briskly, buttering herself some toast. “Then you’d be doing
something sensible like Arithmancy.”
“You’re eating again, I notice,” said Ron, watching Hermione
adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too.
“I’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf
rights,” said Hermione haughtily.
“Yeah. . . and you were hungry,” said Ron, grinning.
There was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls
came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail.
Instinctively, Harry looked up, but there was no sign of white among the mass
of brown and gray. The owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom
their letters and packages were addressed. A large tawny owl soared down to
Neville Longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap - Neville almost always
forgot to pack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy’s eagle
owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of
sweets and cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of
disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible
that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn’t even got his
letter?
His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable
patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by
Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen.
Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding
vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of
large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.
“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly. “They need
squeezing. You will collect the pus -“
“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.
“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout, “and it’s extremely
valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles.
Wear your dragon-hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when
undiluted, bubotuber pus.”
Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As
each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst
forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as
Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected
several pints.
“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout,
stoppering the last bottle with a cork. “An excellent remedy for the more
stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to
desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”
“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a
hushed voice. “She tried to curse hers off.”
“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head. “But Madam
Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.”
A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds,
signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing
the stone steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other
direction, down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s small wooden cabin, which
stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his
enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on
the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar,
apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer,
an odd rattling noise reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor
explosions.
“Mornin’!” Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “Be’er wait
fer the Slytherins, they won’ want ter miss this - Blast-Ended Skrewts!”
“Come again?” said Ron.
Hagrid pointed down into the crates.
“Eurgh!” squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward. “Eurgh” just about
summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts in Harry’s opinion. They looked like
deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking
out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of
them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another,
bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very
powerful smell of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the
end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several
inches.
“On’y jus’ hatched,” said Hagrid proudly, “so yeh’ll be able ter raise ‘em
yerselves! Thought we’d make a bit of a project of it!”
“And why would we want to raise them?” said a cold voice.
The Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle
were chuckling appreciatively at his words.
Hagrid looked stumped at the question.
“I mean, what do they do?” asked Malfoy. “What is the point of them?”
Hagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few seconds’
pause, then he said roughly, “Tha’s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus’ feedin’ ‘em
today. Now, yeh’ll wan’ ter try ‘em on a few diff’rent things - I’ve never had
‘em before, not sure what they’ll go fer - I got ant eggs an’ frog livers an’ a bit
o’ grass snake - just try ‘em out with a bit of each.”
“First pus and now this,” muttered Seamus.
Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and
Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates
to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t suppress the suspicion that
the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to have
mouths.
“Ouch!” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes. “It got me.”
Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.
“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.
“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said Hagrid, nodding.
“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again. “Eurgh, Hagrid, what’s that pointy thing
on it?”
“Ah, some of ‘em have got stings,” said Hagrid enthusiastically (Lavender
quickly withdrew her hand from the box). “I reckon they’re the males. . . . The
females’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies. . . . I think they might be ter
suck blood.”
“Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep them alive,” said Malfoy
sarcastically. “Who wouldn’t want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at
once?”
“Just because they’re not very pretty, it doesn’t mean they’re not useful,”
Hermione snapped. “Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t
want a dragon for a pet, would you?”
Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind
his bushy beard. Hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as
Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew only too well - he had owned one for a brief
period during their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of
Norbert. Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better.
“Well, at least the skrewts are small,” said Ron as they made their way back up
to the castle for lunch an hour later.
“They are now,” said Hermione in an exasperated voice, “but once Hagrid’s
found out what they eat, I expect they’ll be six feet long.”
“Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will
it?” said Ron, grinning slyly at her.
“You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up,” said Hermione.
“As a matter of fact I think he’s right. The best thing to do would be to stamp
on the lot of them before they start attacking us all.”
They sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and
potatoes. Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her.
“Er - is this the new stand on elf rights?” said Ron. “You’re going to make
yourself puke instead?”
“No,” said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth
bulging with sprouts. “I just want to get to the library.”
“What?” said Ron in disbelief. “Hermione - it’s the first day back! We haven’t
even got homework yet!”
Hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had
not eaten for days. Then she leapt to her feet, said, “See you at dinner!” and
departed at high speed.
When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, Harry and Ron set
off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver
stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where
Professor Trelawney lived.
The familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they
emerged at the top of the stepladder. As ever, the curtains were all closed; the
circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps, which
were all draped with scarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked through the
mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat down
at the same small circular table.
“Good day,” said the misty voice of Professor Trelawney right behind Harry,
making him jump.
A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too
large for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the
tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him. The usual large
amount of beads, chains, and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight.
“You are preoccupied, my dear,” she said mournfully to Harry. “My inner eye
sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within. And I regret to say that
your worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas. . . most
difficult.. . I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass. . . and perhaps
sooner than you
Her voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his eyes at Harry, who
looked stonily back. Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in
a large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class. Lavender Brown and
Parvati Patil, who deeply admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs
very close to her.
“My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,” she said. “The movements of
the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who
understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered
by the planetary rays, which intermingle. . .“
But Harry’s thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire always made him feel
sleepy and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney’s rambling talks on fortunetelling never held him exactly spellbound - though he couldn’t help thinking
about what she had just said to him. “I fear the thing you dread will indeed
come to
But Hermione was right, Harry thought irritably, Professor Trelawney really
was an old fraud. He wasn’t dreading anything at the moment at all. . . well,
unless you counted his fears that Sirius had been caught. . . but what did
Professor Trelawney know? He had long since come to the conclusion that her
brand of fortunetelling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky
manner.
Except, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the
prediction about Voldemort rising again. . . and Dumbledore himself had said
that he thought that trance had been genuine, when Harry had described it to
him.
“Harry!” Ron muttered.
“What?”
Harry looked around; the whole class was staring at him. He sat up straight; he
had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts.
“I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence
of Saturn,” said Professor Trelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at
the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words.
“Born under - what, sorry?” said Harry.
“Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!” said Professor Trelawney, sounding
definitely irritated that he wasn’t riveted by this news. “I was saying that
Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your
birth. . . . Your dark hair. . . your mean losses so young in life. .
. I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?”
“No,” said Harry, “I was born in July.”
Ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.
Half an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart,
and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth.
It was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of
angles.
“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said Harry after a while, frowning down at his
piece of parchment, “that can’t be right, can it?”
“Aaaaah,” said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney’s mystical whisper, “when
two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being
born, Harry. . . .“
Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not
loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown - “Oh
Professor, look! I think I’ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one’s that,
Professor?”
“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.
“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said Ron.
Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps,
that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.
“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month
will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,” she snapped, sounding
much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy-fairy self. “I want it
ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!”
“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the
staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner. “That’ll take all weekend, that
will. . .”
“Lots of homework?” said Hermione brightly, catching up with them.
“Professor Vector didn’t give us any at all!”
“Well, bully for Professor Vector,” said Ron moodily.
They reached the entrance hall, which was packed with people queuing for
dinner. They had just joined the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out
behind them.
“Weasley! Hey, Weasley!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing
there, each looking thoroughly pleased about something.
“What?” said Ron shortly.
“Your dad’s in the paper, Weasley!” said Malfoy, brandishing a copy of the
Daily Prophet and speaking very loudly, so that everyone in the packed
entrance hall could hear. “Listen to this!
FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
It seems as though the Ministry of Magic’s troubles are not yet at an end, writes
Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Recently under fire for its poor
crowd control at the Quidditch World Cup, and still unable to account for the
disappearance of one of its witches, the Ministry was plunged into fresh
embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the Misuse of
Muggle Artifacts Office.”
Malfoy looked up.
“Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It’s almost as
though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?” he crowed.
Everyone in the entrance hall was listening now. Malfoy straightened the
paper with a flourish and read on:
Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years
ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several Muggle law-keepers
(“policemen”) over a number of highly aggressive dustbins. Mr. Weasley
appears to have rushed to the aid of “Mad-Eye” Moody, the aged ex-Auror who
retired from the Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a
handshake and attempted murder. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley found, upon
arrival at Mr. Moody’s heavily guarded house, that Mr. Moody had once again
raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was forced to modify several memories
before he could escape from the policemen, but refused to answer Daily
Prophet questions about why he had involved the Ministry in such an
undignified and potentially embarrassing scene.
“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and
holding it up. “A picture of your parents outside their house - if you can call it
a house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn’t she?”
Ron was shaking with fury. Everyone was staring at him.
“Get stuffed, Malfoy,” said Harry. “C’mon, Ron. . .”
“Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren’t you, Potter?”
sneered Malfoy. “So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the
picture?”
“You know your mother, Malfoy?” said Harry - both he and Hermione had
grabbed the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy -
“that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under her nose? Has she always
looked like that, or was it just because you were with her?”
Malfoy’s pale face went slightly pink.
“Don’t you dare insult my mother, Potter.”
“Keep your fat mouth shut, then,” said Harry, turning away.
BANG!
Several people screamed - Harry felt something white-hot graze the side of his
face - he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand, but before he’d even
touched it, he heard a second loud BANG, and a roar that echoed through the
entrance hall.
“OH NO YOU DON’T, LADDIE!”
Harry spun around. Professor Moody was limping down the marble staircase.
His wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was
shivering on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where Malfoy had been standing.
There was a terrified silence in the entrance hall. Nobody but Moody was
moving a muscle. Moody turned to look at Harry -- at least, his normal eye was
looking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head.
“Did he get you?” Moody growled. His voice was low and gravelly.
“No,” said Harry, “missed.”
“LEAVE IT!” Moody shouted.
“Leave - what?” Harry said, bewildered.
“Not you - him!” Moody growled, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at
Crabbe, who had just frozen, about to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that
Moody’s rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head.
Moody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the ferret, which gave a
terrified squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons.
“I don’t think so!” roared Moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again - it flew
ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward
once more.
“I don’t like people who attack when their opponent’s back’s turned,” growled
Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain. “Stinking,
cowardly, scummy thing to
The ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing helplessly.
“Never - do - that - again -“ said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit
the stone floor and bounced upward again.
“Professor Moody!” said a shocked voice.
Professor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full
of books.
“Hello, Professor McGonagall,” said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still
higher.
“What - what are you doing?” said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following
the bouncing ferret’s progress through the air.
“Teaching,” said Moody.
“Teach - Moody, is that a student?” shrieked Professor McGonagall, the
books spilling out of her arms.
“Yep,” said Moody.
“No!” cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her
wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had
reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his
now brilliantly pink face. He got to his feet, wincing.
“Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!” said Professor
McGonagall wealdy. “Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?”
“He might’ve mentioned it, yeah,” said Moody, scratching his chin
unconcernedly, “but I thought a good sharp shock -“
“We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender’s Head of House!”
“I’ll do that, then,” said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike.
Malfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation, looked
malevolently up at Moody and muttered something in which the words “my
father” were distinguishable.
“Oh yeah?” said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull clunk of
his wooden leg echoing around the hall. “Well, I know your father of old,
boy... . You tell him Moody’s keeping a close eye on his son. . . you tell him
that from me. . . . Now, your Head of House’ll be Snape, will it?”
“Yes,” said Malfoy resentfully.
“Another old friend,” growled Moody. “I’ve been looking forward to a chat
with old Snape. . . . Come on, you. . .”
And he seized Malfoy’s upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons.
Professor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then
waved her wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and
back into her arms.
“Don’t talk to me,” Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione as they sat down at
the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides
about what had just happened.
“Why not?” said Hermione in surprise.
“Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,” said Ron, his eyes closed
and an uplifted expression on his face. “Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing
ferret.”
Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole
onto each of their plates.
“He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,” she said. “It was good, really, that
Professor McGonagall stopped it –“
“Hermione!” said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, “you’re ruining
the best moment of my life!”
Hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again.
“Don’t tell me you’re going back to the library this evening?” said Harry,
watching her.
“Got to,” said Hermione thickly. “Loads to do.”
“But you told us Professor Vector -“
“It’s not schoolwork,” she said. Within five minutes, she had cleared her plate
and departed. No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred
Weasley.
“Moody!” he said. “How cool is he?”
“Beyond cool,” said George, sitting down opposite Fred. “Supercool,” said the
twins’ best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat beside George. “We had
him this afternoon,” he told Harry and Ron.
“What was it like?” said Harry eagerly.
Fred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning.
“Never had a lesson like it,” said Fred.
“He knows, man,” said Lee.
“Knows what?” said Ron, leaning forward.
“Knows what it’s like to be out there doing it,” said George impressively.
“Doing what?” said Harry.
“Fighting the Dark Arts,” said Fred.
“He’s seen it all,” said George.
“Mazing,” said Lee.
Ron dived into his bag for his schedule.
“We haven’t got him till Thursday!” he said in a disappointed voice.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN – THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES
The next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted
Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to
have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Nevihle
detention, and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having
been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.
“You know why Snape’s in such a foul mood, don’t you?” said Ron
to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to
remove the frog guts from under his fingernails.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Moody.”
It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts
job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had
disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it - but he seemed
strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed,
whenever Harry saw the two of them together - at mealtimes, or when they
passed in the corridors - he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding
Moody’s eye, whether magical or normal.
“I reckon Snape’s a bit scared of him, you know,” Harry said thoughtfully.
“Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,” said Ron, his eyes misting
over, “and bounced him all around his dungeon...”
The Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody’s first lesson so
much that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his
classroom before the bell had even rung. The only person missing was
Hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson.
“Been in the -“
“Library.” Harry finished her sentence for her. “C’mon, quick, or we won’t get
decent seats.”
They hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher’s desk, took out their
copies of The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, and waited, unusually
quiet. Soon they heard Moody’s distinctive clunking footsteps coming down
the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as
ever. They could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath
his robes.
“You can put those away,” he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting
down, “those books. You won’t need them.”
They returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited.
Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his
twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye moving
steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each
student as he or she answered.
“Right then,” he said, when the last person had declared themselves present,
“I’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you’ve had a
pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures – you’ve covered
boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that
right?”
There was a general murmur of assent.
“But you’re behind - very behind - on dealing with curses,” said Moody. “So
I’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I’ve
got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark -“
“What, aren’t you staying?” Ron blurted out.
Moody’s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely
apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled - the first time Harry had seen
him do so. The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted
and contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did
anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply relieved.
“You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?” Moody said. “Your father got me out
of a very tight corner a few days ago. .. . Yeah, I’m staying just the one year.
Special favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back to my quiet
retirement.”
He gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together.
“So - straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now,
according to the Ministry of Magic, I’m supposed to teach you countercurses
and leave it at that. I’m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses
look like until you’re in the sixth year. You’re not supposed to be old enough
to deal with it till then. But Professor Dumbledore’s got a higher opinion of
your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what
you’re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against
something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on
you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice
and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert and
watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m talking.”
Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her completed
horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody’s magical eye could see through
solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.
“So. . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by
wizarding law?”
Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.
Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.
“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one.. . . Is it called the
Imperius Curse, or something?”
“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father would know that one.
Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and took
out a glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry
felt Ron recoil slightly next to him - Ron hated spiders.
Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of
his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it and
muttered, “Imperio!”
The spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing
backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly,
then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began
to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of
its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance.
Everyone was laughing - everyone except Moody.
“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it, would you, if I did it to
you?”
The laughter died away almost instantly.
“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to
roll over and over. “I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself,
throw itself down one of your throats. . .“
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the
Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the days in
which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry, trying to
sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it takes
real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid being hit with
it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone jumped.
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.
“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”
Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise, did
Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was
Herbology which was easily his best subject. Neville looked surprised at his
own daring.
“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville.
“There’s one - the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a small but distinct voice.
Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes.
“Your name’s Longbottom?” he said, his magical eye swooping down to check
the register again.
Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back
to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it
upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move.
“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody. “Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get
the idea,” he said, pointing his wand at the spider. “Engorgio!”
The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all
pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody’s desk as
possible.
Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, “Crucio!”
At once, the spider’s legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to
twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came from it, but Harry
was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming.
Moody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk
more violently - “Stop it!” Hermione said shrilly.”
Harry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville,
and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville’s hands were clenched upon the
desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified.
Moody raised his wand. The spider’s legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch.
“Reducio,” Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He
put it back into the jar.
“Pain,” said Moody softly. “You don’t need thumbscrews or knives to torture
someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was very
popular once too.
“Right. . . anyone know any others?”
Harry looked around. From the looks on everyone’s faces, he guessed they
were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione’s
hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air.
“Yes?” said Moody, looking at her.
“Avada Kedavra,” Hermione whispered.
Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.
“Ah,” said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. “Yes, the
last and worst. Avada Kedavra. .. the Killing Curse.”
He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was
coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying
to evade Moody’s fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It
started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface.
Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.
“Avada Kedavra!” Moody roared.
There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast,
invisible something was soaring through the air - instantaneously the spider
rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the
students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off
his seat as the spider skidded toward him.
Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.
“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s no countercurse.
There’s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s
sitting right in front of me.”
Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked into his own.
He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the
blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at
So that was how his parents had died. . . exactly like that spider. Had they been
unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light
and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies?
Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for three years
now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d found
out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’
whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How
Voldemort had killed Harry’s father first. How James Potter had tried to hold
him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run. . . Voldemort had
advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry.. .
how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son.. .
and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry.
Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents’ voices when he had
fought the dementors last year - for that was the terrible power of the dementors:
to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown,
powerless, in their own despair.
Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With a
massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what
Moody was saying.
“Avada Kedavra’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you
could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I
doubt I’d get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn’t matter. I’m not here to
teach you how to do it.
“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because you’ve got
to know. You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to find
yourself in a situation where you’re facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he
roared, and the whole class jumped again.
“Now. . . those three curses - Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus - are
known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow
human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That’s what you’re
up against. That’s what I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need preparing.
You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, neverceasing vigilance. Get out your quills. . . copy this down. . . .“
They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable
Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang - but when Moody had dismissed them
and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were
discussing the curses in awed voices - “Did you see it twitch?” “- and when he
killed it - just like that!”
They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been some
sort of spectacular show, but he hadn’t found it very entertaining - and nor, it
seemed, had Hermione.
“Hurry up,” she said tensely to Harry and Ron.
“Not the ruddy library again?” said Ron.
“No,” said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. “Neville.” Neville
was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite
him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody had
demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.
“Neville?” Hermione said gently.
Neville looked around.
“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual. “Interesting lesson,
wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m - I’m starving, aren’t you?”
“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.
“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice. “Very
interesting dinner - I mean lesson - what’s for eating?”
Ron gave Harry a startled look.
“Neville, what - ?“
But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see
Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching
him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler
growl than they had yet heard.
“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up to my
office? Come on. . . we can have a cup of tea. . . .“
Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody. He
neither moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry.
“You all right, are you, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry, almost defiantly.
Moody’s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry. Then he
said, “You’ve got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, but you’ve got to know.
No point pretending. . . well.. . come on, Longbottom, I’ve got some books that
might interest you.”
Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn’t say
anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one
of Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder.
“What was that about?” said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the
corner.
“I don’t know,” said Hermione, looking pensive.
“Some lesson, though, eh?” said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall.
“Fred and George were right, weren’t they? He really knows his stuff, Moody,
doesn’t he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just
snuffed it right -“
But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry’s face and didn’t speak again
until they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better
make a start on Professor Trelawney’s predictions tonight, since they would
take hours.
Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron’s conversation during dinner, but
ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again. Harry and Ron walked
back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all
through dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.
“Wouldn’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they
knew we’d seen the curses?” Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady.
“Yeah, probably,” said Ron. “But Dumbledore’s always done things his way,
hasn’t he, and Moody’s been getting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first
and asks questions later - look at his dustbins. Balderdash.”
The Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and they climbed into
the Gryffindor common room, which was crowded and noisy.
“Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?” said Harry.
“I s’pose,” Ron groaned.
They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find Neville
there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at
the end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were
rather red.
“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.
“Oh yes,” said Neville, “I’m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor
Moody lent me. . .”
He held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.
“Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I’m really good at
Herbology,” Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that
Harry had rarely heard there before. “He thought I’d like this.”
Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very
tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was
good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done.
Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the
common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the
coming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their
table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and
Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from
Professor Trelawney’s fire.
“I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to mean,” he said, staring down at
a long list of calculations.
“You know,” said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had
run his fingers through it in frustration, “I think it’s back to the old Divination
standby.”
“What - make it up?”
“Yeah,” said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping
his pen into some ink, and starting to write.
“Next Monday,” he said as he scribbled, “I am likely to develop a cough, owing
to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.” He looked up at Harry. “You
know her - just put in loads of misery, she’ll lap it up.”
“Right,” said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads
of a group of chattering first years into the fire. “Okay. . . on Monday, I will be
in danger of- er - burns.”
“Yeah, you will be,” said Ron darkly, “we’re seeing the skrewts again on
Monday. Okay, Tuesday, I’ll. . . erm. .
“Lose a treasured possession,” said Harry, who was flicking through
Unfogging the Future for ideas.
“Good one,” said Ron, copying it down. “Because of... erm. . . Mercury. Why
don’t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend?”
“Yeah. . . cool. . .“ said Harry, scribbling it down, “because... Venus is in the
twelfth house.”
“And on Wednesday, I think I’ll come off worst in a fight.”
“Aaah, I was going to have a fight. Okay, I’ll lose a bet.”
“Yeah, you’ll be betting I’ll win my fight. ..
They continued to make up predictions (which grew steadily more tragic) for
another hour, while the common room around them slowly emptied as people
went up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty
chair, and stared inscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if she
knew they weren’t doing their homework properly.
Staring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadn’t yet
used, Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall,
heads together, quills out, poring over a single piece of parchment. It was most
unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently;
they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention.
There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of
parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing
something back at the Burrow. He had thought then that it was another order
form for Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, but it didn’t look like that this time; if it
had been, they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered
whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament.
As Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred, scratched out something
with his quill, and said, in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the
almost deserted room, “No - that sounds like we’re accusing him. Got to be
careful. . .“
Then George looked over and saw Harry watching him. Harry grinned and
quickly returned to his predictions - he didn’t want George to think he was
eavesdropping. Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said
good night, and went off to bed.
Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened
and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in
one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other.
Crookshanks arched his back, purring.
“Hello,” she said, “I’ve just finished!”
“So have I!” said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill.
Hermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair, and
pulled Ron’s predictions toward her.
“Not going to have a very good month, are you?” she said sardonically as
Crookshanks curled up in her lap.
“Ah well, at least I’m forewarned,” Ron yawned.
“You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione.
“Oh am I?” said Ron, peering down at his predictions. “I’d better change one
of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.”
“Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these up?” said Hermione.
“How dare you!” said Ron, in mock outrage. “We’ve been working like houseelves here!”
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
“It’s just an expression,” said Ron hastily.
Harry laid down his quill too, having just finished predicting his own death by
decapitation.
“What’s in the box?” he asked, pointing at it.
“Funny you should ask,” said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron. She took off
the lid and showed them the contents.
Inside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all bearing the same
letters: S. P. E .W.
“Spew?” said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. “What’s this
about?”
“Not spew,” said Hermione impatiently. “It’s S-P-E-W. Stands for the Society
for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.”
“Never heard of it,” said Ron.
“Well, of course you haven’t,” said Hermione briskly, “I’ve only just started
it.”
“Yeah?” said Ron in mild surprise. “How many members have you got?”
“Well - if you two join - three,” said Hermione.
“And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying ‘spew,’ do
you?” said Ron.
“S-P-E-W!” said Hermione hotly. “I was going to put Stop the Outrageous
Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their
Legal Status - but it wouldn’t fit. So that’s the heading of our manifesto.”
She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.
“I’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back
centuries. I can’t believe no one’s done anything about it before now.”
“Hermione - open your ears,” said Ron loudly. “They. Like. It. They like
being enslaved!”
“Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron,
and acting as though she hadn’t heard a word, “are to secure house-elves fair
wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law
about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the
Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they’re shockingly
underrepresented.”
“And how do we do all this?” Harry asked.
“We start by recruiting members,” said Hermione happily. “I thought two
Sickles to join - that buys a badge - and the proceeds can fund our leaflet
campaign. You’re treasurer, Ron - I’ve got you a collecting tin upstairs - and
Harry, you’re secretary, so you might want to write down everything I’m saying
now, as a record of our first meeting.”
There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and Harry
sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look on
Ron’s face. The silence was broken, not by Ron, who in any case looked as
though he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window.
Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the
moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.
“Hedwig!” he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the
room to pull open the window.
Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top of
Harry’s predictions.
“About time!” said Harry, hurrying after her.
“She’s got an answer!” said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of
parchment tied to Hedwig’s leg.
Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto
his knee, hooting softly.
“What does it say?” Hermione asked breathlessly.
The letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great
hurry. Harry read it aloud:
Harry –
I’m flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the latest in a
series of strange rumors that have reached me here. If it hurts again, go
straight to Dumbledore - they’re saying he’s got Mad-Eye out of retirement,
which means he’s reading the signs, even if no one else is.
I’ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep your eyes open,
Harry.
Sirius
Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him.
“He’s flying north?” Hermione whispered. “He’s coming back?”
“Dumbledore’s reading what signs?” said Ron, looking perplexed. “Harry -
what’s up?”
For Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting Hedwig out
of his lap.
“I shouldn’t’ve told him!” Harry said furiously.
“What are you on about?” said Ron in surprise.
“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said Harry, now slamming his fist
on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron’s chair, hooting
indignantly. “Coming back, because he thinks I’m in trouble! And there’s
nothing wrong with me! And I haven’t got anything for you,” Harry snapped at
Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, “you’ll have to go up to the
Owlery if you want food.”
Hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open
window, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went.
“Harry,” Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.
“I’m going to bed,” said Harry shortly. “See you in the morning.”
Upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his four-poster,
but he didn’t feel remotely tired.
If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry’s, fault. Why hadn’t
he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds’ pain and he’d had to blab. . . . If he’d
just had the sense to keep it to himself.
He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak
to him. For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed. The
dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, Harry
would have realized that the absence of Neville’s usual snores meant that he
was not the only one lying awake.
CHAPTER FIFTEEN – BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG
Early next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his
mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night. He got up,
dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and went
back down to the deserted common room. Here he took a piece of parchment
from the table upon which his Divination homework still lay and wrote the
following letter:
Dear Sirius,
I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to
you last time. There’s no point coming back, everything’s fine here. Don’t
worry about me, my head feels completely normal.
Harry
He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up
only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along
the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at
the top of West Tower.
The Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of
the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl
droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon
hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that
rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and
there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled between a
barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the droppingstrewn floor.
It took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as she
kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently
still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end, it was
Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to
borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the
letter to it.
“Just find him, all right?” Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his
arm to one of the holes in the wall. “Before the dementors do.”
She nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have
done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she
spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of
sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so
sure that Sirius’s reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.
“That was a lie, Harry,” said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told
her and Ron what he had done. “You didn’t imagine your scar hurting and you
know it.”
“So what?” said Harry. “He’s not going back to Azkaban because of me.”
“Drop it,” said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue
some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.
Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks.
True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning
when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent
himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down
some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his
godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so
well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other hand,
their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before,
particularly Moody’s Defense Against the Dark Arts.
To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the
Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see
whether they could resist its effects.
“But - but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said Hermione uncertainly as Moody
cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in
the middle of the room. “You said - to use it against another human was -“
“Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,” said Moody, his magical eye
swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. “If
you’d rather learn the hard way - when someone’s putting it on you so they can
control you completely - fine by me. You’re excused. Off you go.”
He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and
muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and
Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber
pus than miss such an important lesson.
Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse
upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most
extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times
around the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a
squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would
certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed
to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody
had removed it.
“Potter,” Moody growled, “you next.”
Harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that
Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and
said, ‘1mperio!”
It was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every
thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a
vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only
dimly aware of everyone watching him.
And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, echoing in some distant chamber
of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk. . . jump onto the desk. . .
Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.
Jump onto the desk....
Why, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain.
Stupid thing to do, really, said the voice.
Jump onto the desk....
No, I don’t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly. . . no, I
don’t really want to.
Jump! NOW!
The next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and tried
to prevent himself from jumping - the result was that he’d smashed headlong
into the desk knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his
kneecaps.
“Now, that’s more like it!” growled Moody’s voice, and suddenly, Harry felt
the empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear. He remembered exactly what
was happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double.
“Look at that, you lot. . . Potter fought! He fought it, and he damn near beat it!
We’ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention - watch his eyes,
that’s where you see it - very good, Potter, very good indeed! They’ll have
trouble controlling you!”
“The way he talks,” Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against
the Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through
his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse entirely),
“you’d think we were all going to be attacked any second.”
“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step. He had
had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him
the effects would wear off by lunchtime. “Talk about paranoid. . .“ Ron
glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of
earshot and went on. “No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted
‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day? And when are we supposed to read up
on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we’ve got to do?”
All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they
were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the
class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration
homework she had assigned.
“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!” she
told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles. “Your
Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer --“
“We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” s aid Dean Thomas indignantly.
“Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get!
Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a
hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your
pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!”
Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look
too pleased with herself.
Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that
they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class.
She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their
unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them - but they were less
amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both
of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes.
Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them
writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century.
Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one
seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before
Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to
read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.
Even Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended Skrewts were
growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they
ate. Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their “project,” suggested that they
come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make
notes on their extraordinary behavior.
“I will not,” said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the
air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack. “I see enough
of these foul things during lessons, thanks.”
Hagrid’s smile faded off his face.
“Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told,” he growled, “or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor
Moody’s book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.”
The Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but
apparently the memory of Moody’s punishment was still sufficiently painful to
stop him from retorting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at the
end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was
particularly satisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get
Hagrid sacked the previous year.
When they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves unable to proceed
owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a
large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron, the
tallest of the three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and
read the sign aloud to the other two:
TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT
THE DELEGATIONS FROM BEAUXBATONS AND
DURMSTRANG WILL BE ARRIVING AT 6 O’CLOCK
ON FRIDAY THE 30TH OF OCTOBER. LESSONS WILL
END HALF AN HOUR EARLY --
“Brilliant!” said Harry. “It’s Potions last thing on Friday! Snape
won’t have time to poison us all!”
STUDENTS WILL RETURN THEIR BAGS AND BOOKS
TO THEIR DORMITORIES AND ASSEMBLE IN FRONT
OF THE CASTLE TO GREET OUR GUESTS BEFORE
THE WELCOMING FEAST.
“Only a week away!” said Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff, emerging
from the crowd, his eyes gleaming. “I wonder if Cedric knows? Think I’ll go
and tell him. . . .“
“Cedric?” said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off.
“Diggory,” said Harry. “He must be entering the tournament.”
“That idiot, Hogwarts champion?” said Ron as they pushed their way through
the chattering crowd toward the staircase.
“He’s not an idiot. You just don’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at
Quidditch,” said Hermione. “I’ve heard he’s a really good student - and he’s a
prefect.”
She spoke as though this settled the matter.
“You only like him because he’s handsome,” said Ron scathingly.
“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said
Hermione indignantly.
Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like “Lockhart!”
The appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the
inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be only
one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard
Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious
germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the tournament
would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed
from themselves.
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-thorough
cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of
their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as
they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and
moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so
ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair
of first-year girls into hysterics.
Other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.
“Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even perform a simple
Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!” Professor McGonagall
barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had
accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus.
When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October,
they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk
banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts House: red
with a gold lion for Gryffiindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow
with a black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin.
Behind the teachers’ table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of
arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter H.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor
table. Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone
else and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to them.
“It’s a bummer, all right,” George was saying gloomily to Fred. “But if he
won’t talk to us in person, we’ll have to send him the letter after all. Or we’ll
stuff it into his hand. He can’t avoid us forrever.
“Who’s avoiding you?” said Ron, sitting down next to them.
“Wish you would,” said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption.
“What’s a bummer?” Ron asked George.
“Having a nosy git like you for a brother,” said George.
“You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?” Harry asked.
“Thought any more about trying to enter?”
“I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn’t telling,”
said George bitterly. “She just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring
my raccoon.”
“Wonder what the tasks are going to be?” said Ron thoughtfully. “You know,
I bet we could do them, Harry. We’ve done dangerous stuff before. . . .“
“Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t,” said Fred. “McGonagall says
the champions get awarded points according to how well they’ve done the
tasks.”
“Who are the judges?” Harry asked.
“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,” said
Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, “because all
three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice
the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.”
She noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air of impatience
that nobody else had read all the books she had, “It’s all in Hogwarts, A
History. Though, of course, that book’s not entirely reliable. A Revised
History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title. Or A Highly Biased and
Selective History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the
School.”
“What are you on about?” said Ron, though Harry thought he knew what was
coming.
“House-elves!” said Hermione, her eyes flashing. “Not once, in over a
thousand pages, does Hogwarts, A History mention that we are all colluding in
the oppression of a hundred slaves!”
Harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs. His and Ron’s
lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione’s
determination to pursue justice for house-elves.
True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had
only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if
anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been
badgering Harry and Ron ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade
others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor
common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin
under their noses.
“You do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms
cleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid
and enslaved?” she kept saying fiercely.
Some people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione from glowering at
them. A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant
to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a
joke.
Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn
sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins had
refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George, however, leaned in toward
Hermione.
“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?”
“No, of course not,” said Hermione curtly, “I hardly think students are
supposed to -“
“Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads of times, to nick food.
And we’ve met them, and they’re happy. They think they’ve got the best job in
the world -“
“That’s because they’re uneducated and brainwashed!” Hermione began hotly,
but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from
overhead, which announced the arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at
once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione stopped talking abruptly;
she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry’s
shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily.
Harry pulled off Sirius’s reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she
ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in
further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out Sirius’s
letter in a whisper to Ron and Hermione.
Nice try, Harry.
I’m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to keep me posted on
everything that’s going on at Hogwarts. Don’t use Hedwig, keep changing
owls, and don’t worry about me, just watch out for yourself Don’t forget what I
said about your scar.
Sirius
“Why d’you have to keep changing owls?” Ron asked in a low
voice.
“Hedwig’ll attract too much attention,” said Hermione at once. “She
stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he’s hiding. . . I
mean, they’re not native birds, are they?”
Harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering
whether he felt more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius
managing to get back without being caught was something. He couldn’t deny
either that the idea that Sirius was much nearer was reassuring; at least he
wouldn’t have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote.
“Thanks, Hedwig,” he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily, dipped her beak
briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for
a good long sleep in the Owlery.
There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. Nobody was
very attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening
of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was more
bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter. When the bell rang early,
Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags
and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back
downstairs into the entrance hall.
The Heads of Houses were ordering their students into lines.
“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron. “Miss
Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.”
Parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her
plait.
“Follow me, please,” said Professor McGonagall. “First years in front. . . no
pushing.. .
They filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle. It was a cold, clear
evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent-looking moon was already
shining over the Forbidden Forest. Harry, standing between Ron and Hermione
in the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with
anticipation among the other first years.
“Nearly six,” said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that
led to the front gates. “How d’you reckon they’re coming? The train?”
“I doubt it,” said Hermione.
“How, then? Broomsticks?” Harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky.
“I don’t think so. . . not from that far away.. .
“A Portkey?” Ron suggested. “Or they could Apparate - maybe you’re allowed
to do it under seventeen wherever they come from?”
“You can’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do I have to tell
you?” said Hermione impatiently.
They scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving;
everything was still, silent, and quite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold.
He wished they’d hurry up. .. . Maybe the foreign students were preparing a
dramatic entrance. . . . He remembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the
campsite before the Quidditch World Cup: “always the same - we can’t resist
showing off when we get together. ..”
And then Dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the
other teachers - “Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from
Beauxbatons approaches!”
“Where?” said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions.
“There!” yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest.
Something large, much larger than a broomstick - or, indeed, a hundred
broomsticks - was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing
larger all the time.
“It’s a dragon!” shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely.
“Don’t be stupid. . . it’s a flying house!” said Dennis Creevey.
Dennis’s guess was closer. . . . As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the
treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows
hit it, they saw a gigantic, powderblue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large
house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses,
all palominos, and each the size of an elephant.
The front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever
lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed - then, with an almighty crash
that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year’s foot, the horses’
hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage
landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their
enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes.
Harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two
crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened.
A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled
for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden
steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled
black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage - a shoe the size of a child’s
sled - followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in
his life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained.
A few people gasped.
Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that
was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights.
Yet somehow - maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid - this woman
(now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed
crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light
flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, oliveskinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose. Her
hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed
from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her
throat and on her thick fingers.
Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into
applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.
Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward
Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had
barely to bend to kiss it.
“My dear Madame Maxime,” he said. “Welcome to Hogwarts.”
“Dumbly-dort,” said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. “I ‘ope I find you
well?”
“In excellent form, I thank you,” said Dumbledore.
“My pupils,” said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands
carelessly behind her.
Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime,
now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their
late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind
Madame Maxime. They were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that
their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing
cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads. From what
Harry could see of them (they were standing in Madame Maxime’s enormous
shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their
faces.
“As Karkaroff arrived yet?” Madame Maxime asked.
“He should be here any moment,” said Dumbledore. “Would you like to wait
here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?”
“Warm up, I think,” said Madame Maxime. “But ze ‘orses -“
“Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of
them,” said Dumbledore, “the moment he has returned from dealing with a
slight situation that has arisen with some of his other - er - charges.”
“Skrewts,” Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.
“My steeds require - er - forceful ‘andling,” said Madame Maxime, looking as
though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at
Hogwarts could be up to the job. “Zey are very strong. . . .“
“I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
“Very well,” said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. “Will you please inform
zis ‘Agrid zat ze ‘orses drink only single-malt whiskey?”
“It will be attended to,” said Dumbledore, also bowing.
“Come,” said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts
crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps.
“How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going to be?” Seamus
Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.
“Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won’t be able to handle
them,” said Harry. “That’s if he hasn’t been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder
what’s up with them?”
“Maybe they’ve escaped,” said Ron hopefully.
“Oh don’t say that,” said Hermione with a shudder. “Imagine that lot loose on
the grounds. . . .“
They stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive.
Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky.
For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime’s huge
horses snorting and stamping. But then - “Can you hear something?” said Ron
suddenly.
Harry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out
of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense
vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed.
“The lake!” yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. “Look at the lake!”
From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a
clear view of the smooth black surface of the water - except that the surface was
suddenly not smooth at all. Some disturbance was taking place deep in the
center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing
over the muddy banks - and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool
appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake’s floor. .
What seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the
whirlpool. . . and then Harry saw the rigging....
“It’s a mast!” he said to Ron and Hermione.
Slowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in the
moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though it were a
resurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked
like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged
entirely, bobbing on the turbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank. A
few moments later, they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the
shallows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank.
People were disembarking; they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in
the ship’s portholes. All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along the
lines of Crabbe and Goyle... but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns
into the light streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really
due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted
fur. But the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a
different sort: sleek and silver, like his hair.
“Dumbledore!” he called heartily as he walked up the slope. “How are you, my
dear fellow, how are you?”
“Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,” Dumbledore replied. Karkaroff
had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the light pouring from the
front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like Dumbledore, but
his white hair was short, and his goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not
entirely hide his rather weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore, he shook
hands with both of his own.
“Dear old Hogwarts,” he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth
were rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes,
which remained cold and shrewd. “How good it is to be here, how good.. . .
Viktor, come along, into the warmth. . . you don’t mind, Dumbledore? Viktor
has a slight head
Karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As the boy passed, Harry
caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He
didn’t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to
recognize that profile.
“Harry - it’s Krum!”
CHAPTER SIXTEEN – THE GOBLET OF FIRE
I don’t believe it!” Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts
students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang. “Krum,
Harry! Viktor Krum!”
“For heaven’s sake, Ron, he’s only a Quidditch player,” said
Hermione.
“Only a Quidditch player?” Ron said, looking at her as though he
couldn’t believe his ears. “Hermione - he’s one of the best Seekers in the
world! I had no idea he was still at school!”
As they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts
students heading for the Great Hall, Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and
down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of Krum’s head.
Several sixth-year girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked -
“Oh I don’t believe it, I haven’t got a single quill on me -“
“D’you think he’d sign my hat in lipstick?”
“Really,” Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls, now squabbling over
the lipstick.
“I’m getting his autograph if I can,” said Ron. “You haven’t got a quill, have
you, Harry?”
“Nope, they’re upstairs in my bag,” said Harry.
They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down. Ron took care to sit on
the side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students
were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit.
The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table. They
were looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces.
Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.
“It’s not that cold,” said Hermione defensively. “Why didn’t they bring
cloaks?”
“Over here! Come and sit over here!” Ron hissed. “Over here! Hermione,
budge up, make a space -“
“What?”
“Too late,” said Ron bitterly.
Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the
Slytherin table. Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug
about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum.
“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,” said Ron scathingly. “I bet
Krum can see right through him, though. . . bet he gets people fawning over him
all the time.. . . Where d’you reckon they’re going to sleep? We could offer
him a space in our dormitory, Harry. . . I wouldn’t mind giving him my bed, I
could kip on a camp bed.”
Hermione snorted.
“They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,” said Harry. The
Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the
starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking
up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed.
Up at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He was wearing
his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see that
he added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore’s.
“But there are only two extra people,” Harry said. “Why’s Filch putting out
four chairs, who else is coming?”
“Eh?” said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum.
When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House
tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last in
line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime.
When their headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their
feet. A few of the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party
appeared quite unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until
Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore’s left-hand side. Dumbledore
remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.
“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and - most particularly - guests,”
said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. “I have great
pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here
will be both comfortable and enjoyable.”
One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave
what was unmistakably a derisive laugh.
“No one’s making you stay!” Hermione whispered, bristling at her.
“The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,” said
Dumbledore. “I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!”
He sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in
conversation.
The plates in front of them filled with food as usual. The house-elves in the
kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there was a greater variety of
dishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen, including several that were
definitely foreign.
“What’s that?” said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew
that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.
“Bouillabaisse,” said Hermione.
“Bless you,” said Ron.
“It’s French,” said Hermione, “I had it on holiday summer before last. It’s very
nice.”
“I’ll take your word for it,” said Ron, helping himself to black pudding.
The Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual, even though
there were barely twenty additional students there; perhaps it was because their
differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the
Hogwarts’ robes. Now that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang
students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred.
Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes
after the start of the feast. He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry,
Ron, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand.
“Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?” Harry called.
“Thrivin’,” Hagrid called back happily.
“Yeah, I’ll just bet they are,” said Ron quietly. “Looks like they’ve finally
found a food they like, doesn’t it? Hagrid’s fingers.”
At that moment, a voice said, “Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?”
It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore’s
speech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde
hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white,
even teeth.
Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing
came out except a faint gurgling noise.
“Yeah, have it,” said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl.
“You ‘ave finished wiz it?”
“Yeah,” Ron said breathlessly. “Yeah, it was excellent.”
The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw table.
Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before. Harry
started to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses.
“She’s a veela!” he said hoarsely to Harry.
“Of course she isn’t!” said Hermione tartly. “I don’t see anyone else gaping at
her like an idiot!”
But she wasn’t entirely right about that. As the girl crossed the Hall, many
boys’ heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily
speechless, just like Ron.
“I’m telling you, that’s not a normal girl!” said Ron, leaning sideways so he
could keep a clear view of her. “They don’t make them like that at Hogwarts!”
“They make them okay at Hogwarts,” said Harry without thinking. Cho
happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair.
“When you’ve both put your eyes back in,” said Hermione briskly, “you’ll be
able to see who’s just arrived.”
She was pointing up at the staff table. The two remaining empty seats had just
been filled. Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff’s other side,
while Mr. Crouch, Percy’s boss, was next to Madame Maxime.
“What are they doing here?” said Harry in surprise.
“They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn’t they?” said Hermione. “I
suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.”
When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts
too. Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it
carefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be clearly visible from the
Ravenclaw table. The girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten
enough, however, and did not come over to get it.
Once the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again. A
pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill of
excitement, wondering what was coming. Several seats down from them, Fred
and George were leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great
concentration.
“The moment has come,” said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of
upturned faces. “The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to
say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket --“
“The what?” Harry muttered.
Ron shrugged.
“- just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year. But first, let
me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch, Head of
the Department of International Magical Cooperation” - there was a smattering
of polite applause - “and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of
Magical Games and Sports.”
There was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch,
perhaps because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much
more likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius
Crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced. Remembering
him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked
strange in wizard’s robes. His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked
very odd next to Dumbledore’s long white hair and beard.
“Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months
on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament,” Dumbledore continued,
“and they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on
the panel that will judge the champions’ efforts.”
At the mention of the word “champions,” the attentiveness of the listening
students seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden
stillness, for he smiled as he said, “The casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.”
Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now
approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It
looked extremely old. A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching
students; Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but,
being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else’s.
“The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already
been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,” said Dumbledore as Filch
placed the chest carefully on the table before him, “and they have made the
necessary arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced
throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different
ways.. their magical prowess - their daring - their powers of deduction - and, of
course, their ability to cope with danger.”
At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody
seemed to be breathing.
“As you know, three champions compete in the tournament,” Dumbledore went
on calmly, “one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on
how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the
highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will
be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire.”
Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the
casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled
out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely
unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames.
Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where
it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.
“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name
and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,” said
Dumbledore. “Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their
names forward. Tomorrow night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names
of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet
will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to
all those wishing to compete.
“To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,” said Dumbledore, “I
will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed
in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this
line.
“Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this
tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected
by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the
end. The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical
contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion.
Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play
before you drop your name into the goblet. Now, I think it is time for bed.
Good night to you all.”
“An Age Line!” Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their
way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall. “Well, that should be
fooled by an Aging Potion, shouldn’t it? And once your name’s in that goblet,
you’re laughing - it can’t tell whether you’re seventeen or not!”
“But I don’t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,” said Hermione,
“we just haven’t learned enough. . .“
“Speak for yourself,” said George shortly. “You’ll try and get in, won’t you,
Harry?”
Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore’s insistence that nobody under seventeen
should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the
Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again. .. . He wondered how angry
Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get
over the Age Line.
“Where is he?” said Ron, who wasn’t listening to a word of this conversation,
but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum. “Dumbledore
didn’t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did he?”
But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin
table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students.
“Back to the ship, then,” he was saying. “Viktor, how are you feeling? Did you
eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?”
Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on. “Professor,
Ivood like some vine,” said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully.
“I wasn’t offering it to you, Poliakoff,” snapped Karkaroff, his warmly paternal
air vanishing in an instant. “I notice you have dribbled food all down the front
of your robes again, disgusting boy -“
Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly
the same moment as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry stopped to let him walk
through first.
“Thank you,” said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him. And then Karkaroff
froze. He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he
couldn’t believe his eyes. Behind their headmaster, the students from
Durmstrang came to a halt too. Karkaroff’s eyes moved slowly up Harry’s face
and fixed upon his scar. The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at
Harry too. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a
few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to
him and pointed openly at Harry’s forehead.
“Yeah, that’s Harry Potter,” said a growling voice from behind them.
Professor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody was standing there, leaning
heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang
headmaster.
The color drained from Karkaroff’s face as Harry watched. A terrible look of
mingled fury and fear came over him.
“You!” he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him.
“Me,” said Moody grimly. “And unless you’ve got anything to say to Potter,
Karkaroff, you might want to move. You’re blocking the doorway.”
It was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking
over one another’s shoulders to see what was causing the holdup.
Without another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him.
Moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his
back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.
As the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted
late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier
than they usually did on weekends. When they went down into the entrance
hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast,
all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the hall on
the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced
on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction.
“Anyone put their name in yet?” Ron asked a third-year girl eagerly.
“All the Durmstrang lot,” she replied. “But I haven’t seen anyone from
Hogwarts yet.”
“Bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all gone to bed,” said Harry. “I
would’ve if it had been me. . . wouldn’t have wanted everyone watching. What
if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?”
Someone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee
Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.
“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
“Just taken it.”
“What?” said Ron.
“The Aging Potion, dung brains,” said Fred.
“One drop each,” said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. “We only
need to be a few months older.”
“We’re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us
wins,” said Lee, grinning broadly.
“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said Hermione warningly. “I’m
sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.”
Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.
“Ready?” Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement. “C’mon, then
- I’ll go first -“
Harry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket
bearing the words Fred Weasley - Hogwarts. Fred walked right up to the edge
of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fiftyfoot drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he
took a great breath and stepped over the line.
For a split second Harry thought it had worked - George certainly thought so,
for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred - but next moment, there was
a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as
though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed
painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there
was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical long white
beards.
The entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once
they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other’s beards.
“I did warn you,” said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see
Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and
George, his eyes twinkling. “I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey. She
is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of
Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I
must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.”
Fred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was
howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went in
to breakfast.
The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was
Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling,
while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the
way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of
seventeen or over who might be entering.
“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name
in,” Dean told Harry. “That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.”
Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in
disgust.
“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”
“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,” said Seamus
contemptuously. “But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to risk his
good looks.”
“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly.
People were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled around in their
seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an
embarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor
Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, “Well, I’ve
done it! Just put my name in!”
“You’re kidding!” said Ron, looking impressed.
“Are you seventeen, then?” asked Harry.
“Course she is, can’t see a beard, can you?” said Ron.
“I had my birthday last week,” said Angelina.
“Well, I’m glad someone from Gryffindor’s entering,” said Hermione. “I really
hope you get it, Angelina!”
“Thanks, Hermione,” said Angelina, smiling at her.
Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory, said Seamus, causing several
Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.
“What’re we going to do today, then?” Ron asked Harry and Hermione when
they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.
“We haven’t been down to visit Hagrid yet,” said Harry.
“Okay,” said Ron, “just as long as he doesn’t ask us to donate a few fingers to
the skrewts.”
A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione’s face.
“I’ve just realized - I haven’t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet!” she said
brightly. “Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?”
“What is it with her?” said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran away up the
marble staircase.
“Hey, Ron,” said Harry suddenly. “It’s your friend. . .“
The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the
grounds, among them, the veela-girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire
stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.
Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into
a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and
dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-white flames. As each name
entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks.
“What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t chosen?” Ron muttered
to Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire.
“Reckon they’ll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?”
“Dunno,” said Harry. “Hang around, I suppose... . Madame Maxime’s staying
to judge, isn’t she?”
When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame
Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again.
“Where are they sleeping, then?” said Ron, moving toward the front doors and
staring after them.
A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione’s reappearance with the
box of S. P. E.W. badges.
“Oh good, hurry up,” said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping
his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn
with Madame Maxime.
As they neared Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery
of the Beauxbatons’ sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder-blue
carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from
Hagrid’s front door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The
elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a
makeshift paddock alongside it.
Harry knocked on Hagrid’s door, and Fang’s booming barks answered
instantly.
“Bout time!” said Hagrid, when he’d flung open the door. “Thought you lot’d
forgotten where I live!”
“We’ve been really busy, Hag -“ Hermione started to say, but then she stopped
dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words.
Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a
checked yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn’t the worst of it, though; he had
evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be
axle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a
ponytail like Bill’s, but found he had too much hair. The look didn’t really suit
Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously
deciding not to comment, she said, “Erm - where are the skrewts.”
“Out by the pumpkin patch,” said Hagrid happily. “They’re get-tin’ massive,
mus’ be nearly three foot long now. On’y trouble is, they’ve started killin’ each
other.”
“Oh no, really?” said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who,
staring at Hagrid’s odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something
about it.
“Yeah,” said Hagrid sadly. “S’ okay, though, I’ve got ‘em in separate boxes
now. Still got abou’ twenty.”
“Well, that’s lucky,” said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.
Hagrid’s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic
bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and
chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead
birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started
to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard
Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.
“You wait,” he said, grinning. “You jus’ wait. Yer going ter see some stuff
yeh’ve never seen before. Firs’ task. . . ah, but I’m not supposed ter say.”
“Go on, Hagrid!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his
head, grinning.
“I don’ want ter spoil it fer yeh,” said Hagrid. “But it’s gonna be spectacular,
I’ll tell yeh that. Them champions’re going ter have their work cut out. Never
thought I’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!”
They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn’t eat much - Hagrid
had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a
large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites. However,
they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the
tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be
selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless
yet.
A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the
fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid
darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves - for he flatly
refused to join S.P.E.W. when she showed him her badges.
“It’d be doin’ ‘em an unkindness, Hermione,” he said gravely, threading a
massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. “It’s in their nature ter look after
humans, that’s what they like, see? Yeh’d be makin’ ‘em unhappy ter take
away their work, an’ insutin’ ‘em if yeh tried ter pay ‘em.”
“But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!” said
Hermione. “And we heard he’s asking for wages now!”
“Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I’m not sayin’ there isn’t the odd
elf who’d take freedom, but yeh’ll never persuade most of ‘em ter do it - no,
nothin’ doin’, Hermione.”
Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her
cloak pocket.
By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided it
was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast - and, more
important, the announcement of the school champions.
“I’ll come with yeh,” said Hagrid, putting away his darning. “Jus’ give us a
sec.”
Hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began
searching for something inside it. They didn’t pay too much attention until a
truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, “Hagrid, what’s
that?”
“Eh?” said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. “Don’ yeh
like it?”
“Is that aftershave?” said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.
“Er - eau de cologne,” Hagrid muttered. He was blushing.
“Maybe it’s a bit much,” he said gruffly. “I’ll go take it off, hang on...”
He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in
the water barrel outside the window.
“Eau de cologne?” said Hermione in amazement. “Hagrid?”
“And what’s with the hair and the suit?” said Harry in an undertone.
“Look!” said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window. Hagrid had just
straightened up and turned ‘round. If he had been blushing before, it was
nothing to what he was doing now. Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that
Hagrid wouldn’t spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the
window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just
emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too. They
couldn’t hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame Maxime
with a rapt, misty-eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once
before - when he had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert.
“He’s going up to the castle with her!” said Hermione indignantly. “I thought
he was waiting for us!”
Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up
the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beaux-batons students following in
their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.
“He fancies her!” said Ron incredulously. “Well, if they end up having
children, they’ll be setting a world record - bet any baby of theirs would weigh
about a ton.”
They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was
surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around
themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns.
“Ooh it’s them, look!” Hermione whispered.
The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake. Viktor
Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang
students were straggling along behind them. Ron watched Krum excitedly, but
Krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of
Hermione, Ron, and Harry and proceeded through them.
When they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full. The Goblet of
Fire had been moved; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore’s empty chair
at the teachers’ table. Fred and George - clean-shaven again - seemed to have
taken their disappointment fairly well.
“Hope it’s Angelina,” said Fred as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down.
“So do I!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Well, we’ll soon know!”
The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual. Perhaps because
it was their second feast in two days, Harry didn’t seem to fancy the
extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally. Like
everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient
expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether
Dumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear,
and to hear who had been selected as champions.
At long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was
a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost
instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On either side of him, Professor
Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone.
Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored.
“Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,” said Dumbledore. “I
estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions’ names are
called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along
the staff table, and go through into the next chamber” - he indicated the door
behind the staff table - “where they will be receiving their first instructions.”
He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the
candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging
them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly
than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the
flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting. . . . A few people
kept checking their watches. . .
“Any second,” Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry.
The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly
from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of
parchment fluttered out of it - the whole room gasped.
Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm’s length, so that
he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.
“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear voice, “will be
Viktor Krum.”
“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the
Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up
toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and
disappeared through the door into the next chamber.
“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him,
even over all the applause. “Knew you had it in you!”
The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s attention was focused
again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece
of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.
“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!”
“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got
gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up
between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding
toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of an
understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had
dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again,
but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it.
The Hogwarts champion next...
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the
tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the
third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No! “ said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from
the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her
feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning
broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers’ table. Indeed,
the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before
Dumbledore could make himself heard again.
“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. “Well,
we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you,
including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give
your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your
champion on, you will contribute in a very real --“
But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody
what had distracted him.
The fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A
long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of
parchment.
Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the
parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a
long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and
everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his
throat and read out - “Harry Potter.”
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN – THE FOUR CHAMPIONS
Harry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned
to look at him. He was stunned. He felt numb. He was surely dreaming. He
had not heard correctly.
There was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was
starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at
Harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat.
Up at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and
swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to
Professor Dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly.
Harry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the long
Gryffindor table all watching him, openmouthed.
“I didn’t put my name in,” Harry said blankly. “You know I
didn’t.”
Both of them stared just as blankly back.
At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up,
nodding to Professor McGonagall.
“Harry Potter!” he called again. “Harry! Up here, if you please!”
“Go on,” Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push.
Harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled
slightly. He set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It
felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem to be getting any
nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as
though each were a searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder. After
what seemed like an hour, he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the
stares of all the teachers upon him.
“Well.. . through the door, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He wasn’t
smiling.
Harry moved off along the teachers’ table. Hagrid was seated right
at the end. He did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of
greeting. He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed
like everyone else. Harry went through the door out of the Great Hall and
found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards. A
handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him.
The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He
saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to
it, which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch
started whispering in his ear.
Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the
fire. They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum,
hunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart
from the other two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring
into the fire. Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw
back her sheet of long, silvery hair.
“What is it?” she said. “Do zey want us back in ze Hall?”
She thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn’t know how to
explain what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the three
champions. It struck him how very tall all of them were.
There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered the
room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.
“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm. “Absolutely
extraordinary! Gentlemen. . . lady,” he added, approaching the fireside and
addressing the other three. “May I introduce - incredible though it may seem -
the fourth Triwizard champion?”
Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry.
Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again
as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour,
however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, “Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester
Bagman.”
“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at all! Harry’s name just
came out of the Goblet of Fire!”
Krum’s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely
bewildered. Fleur frowned.
“But evidently zair ‘as been a mistake,” she said contemptuously to Bagman.
“E cannot compete. ‘E is too young.”
“Well. . . it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling
down at Harry. “But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this
year as an extra safety measure. And as his name’s come out of the goblet.. . I
mean, I don’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage. . . . It’s down in
the rules, you’re obliged. . . Harry will just have to do the best he --“
The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in:
Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff,
Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape. Harry heard the
buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before
Professor McGonagall closed the door.
“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress.
“Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!”
Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?
Madame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height.
The top of her handsome head brushed the candle-filled chandelier, and her
gigantic black-satin bosom swelled.
“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?” she said imperiously. “I’d rather
like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff. He was
wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. “Two Hogwarts
champions? I don’t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two
champions - or have I not read the rules carefully enough?”
He gave a short and nasty laugh.
“C’est impossible,” said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand with its
many superb opals was resting upon Fleur’s shoulder. “Ogwarts cannot ‘ave
two champions. It is most injust.”
“We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger
contestants, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though
his eyes were colder than ever. “Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought
along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools.”
“It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” said Snape softly. His black eyes
were alight with malice. “Don’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s
determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived
here –“
“Thank you, Severus,” said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet, though
his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.
Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back
at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon
spectacles.
“Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” he asked calmly.
“No,” said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely.
Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows.
“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?” said
Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.
“No,” said Harry vehemently.
“Ah, but of course ‘e is lying!” cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now
shaking his head, his lip curling.
“He could not have crossed the Age Line,” said Professor McGonagall sharply.
“I am sure we are all agreed on that -“
“Dumbly-dorr must ‘ave made a mistake wiz ze line,” said Madame Maxime,
shrugging.
“It is possible, of course,” said Dumbledore politely.
“Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake!” said
Professor McGonagall angrily. “Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have
crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not
persuade an older student to do it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough
for everybody else!”
She shot a very angry look at Professor Snape.
“Mr. Crouch.. . Mr. Bagman,” said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more,
“you are our - er - objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is most
irregular?”
Bagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr.
Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden
in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much
older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke, however, it
was in his usual curt voice.
“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose
names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament.”
“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming and
turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now
closed.
“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” said
Karkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore
a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more, and we
will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It’s only fair,
Dumbledore.”
“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said Bagman. “The Goblet of Fire’s
just gone out - it won’t reignite until the start of the next tournament -“
“- in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded
Karkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little
expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now!”
“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door. “You can’t
leave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete.
Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?”
Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with every
right step he took, there was a loud clunk.
“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.”
Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was
saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had
balled themselves into fists.
“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put
Potter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to compete if it came out.”
“Evidently, someone ‘oo wished to give ‘Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!” said
Madame Maxime.
“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff, bowing to her. “I shall be
lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International
Confederation of Wizards -“
“If anyone’s got reason to complain, it’s Potter,” growled Moody, “but. . .
funny thing. . . I don’t hear him saying a word. . .
“Why should ‘e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot. “E ‘as
ze chance to compete, ‘asn’t ‘e? We ‘ave all been ‘oping to be chosen for weeks
and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons in prize money -
zis is a chance many would die for!”
“Maybe someone’s hoping Potter is going to die for it,” said Moody, with the
merest trace of a growl.
An extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was
looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and
said, “Moody, old man. . . what a thing to say!”
“We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn’t
discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,” said Karkaroff loudly.
“Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. An odd
quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt
you had your reasons.
“Imagining things, am I?” growled Moody. “Seeing things, eh? It was a
skilled witch or wizard who put the boy’s name in that goblet. . .
“Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?” said Madame Maxime, throwing up her
huge hands.
“Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!” said Moody. “It
would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle
that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament.. . .
I’m guessing they submitted Potter’s name under a fourth school, to make sure
he was the only one in his category.. . .“
“You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,” said Karkaroff
coldly, “and a very ingenious theory it is - though of course, I heard you
recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a
cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it
was a carriage clock. So you’ll understand if we don’t take you entirely
seriously. . . .“
“There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,” Moody
retorted in a menacing voice. “It’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do,
Karkaroff - as you ought to remember...
“Alastor!” said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a moment whom
he was speaking to, but then realized “Mad-Eye” could hardly be Moody’s real
first name. Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction
- Karkaroff’s face was burning.
“How this situation arose, we do not know,” said Dumbledore, speaking to
everyone gathered in the room. “It seems to me, however, that we have no
choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in
the Tournament. This, therefore, they will do. . .
“Ah, but Dumbly-dorr -“
“My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to
hear it.”
Dumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely glared.
She wasn’t the only one either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid; Bagman,
however, looked rather excited.
“Well, shall we crack on, then?” he said, rubbing his hands together and
smiling around the room. “Got to give our champions their instructions,
haven’t we? Barty, want to do the honors?”
Mr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.
“Yes,” he said, “instructions. Yes . . . the first task . . .“
He moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he looked ill.
There were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his
wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup.
“The first task is designed to test your daring,” he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and
Viktor, “so we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of
the unknown is an important quality in a wizard. . . very important.
“The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the
other students and the panel of judges.
“The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from
their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. The champions will face
the first challenge armed only with their wands. They will receive information
about the second task when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and timeconsuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from end-ofyear tests.”
Mr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.
“I think that’s all, is it, Albus?”
“I think so,” said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with mild
concern. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?”
“No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,” said Mr. Crouch. “It is a
very busy, very difficult time at the moment.... I’ve left young Weatherby in
charge.. . . Very enthusiastic. . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . .
“You’ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?” said Dumbledore.
“Come on, Barry, I’m staying!” said Bagman brightly. “It’s all happening at
Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office!”
“I think not, Ludo,” said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience.
“Professor Karkaroff - Madame Maxime - a nightcap?” said Dumbledore.
But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur’s shoulders and
was leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could hear them both talking
very fast in French as they went off into the Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to
Krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence.
“Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said Dumbledore, smiling at both
of them. “I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with
you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a
great deal of mess and noise.”
Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together.
The Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burned low, giving the
jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality.
“So,” said Cedric, with a slight smile. “We’re playing against each other
again!”
“I s’pose,” said Harry. He really couldn’t think of anything to say. The inside
of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been
ransacked.
“So. . . tell me. . .“ said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was
now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. “How did you get
your name in?”
“I didn’t,” said Harry, staring up at him. “I didn’t put it in. I was telling the
truth.”
“Ah. . . okay,” said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn’t believe him. “Well
. . . see you, then.”
Instead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to its right.
Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly,
he started to climb the marble ones.
Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all
think he’d put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think that,
when he was facing competitors who’d had three years’ more magical education
than he had - when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he’d
thought about it. . . he’d fantasized about it.. . but it had been a joke, really, an
idle sort of dream. . . he’d never really, seriously considered entering. .
But someone else had considered it. . . someone else had wanted him in the
tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat?
He didn’t think so,
To see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get their wish. .
But to get him killed?
Was Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn’t someone have put
Harry’s name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really want
him dead?
Harry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead,
someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old. . . Lord
Voldemort. But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry’s name got into
the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant
country, in hiding, alone. . . feeble and powerless....
Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting,
Voldemort had not been alone. . . he had been talking to Wormtail.. . plotting
Harry’s murder.
Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely
noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she
was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her
neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now
sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every
picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat
Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.
“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady, “Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s
just been chosen as school champion, then?”
“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.
“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.
“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung
forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room.
The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost
knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the
common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of
Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.
“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half
annoyed, half deeply impressed.
“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!” roared George.
“I didn’t,” Harry said. “I don’t know how -“
But Angelina had now swooped down upon him; “Oh if it couldn’t be me, at
least it’s a Gryffindor -“
“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!”
shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.
“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some -“
“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast -“
But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry; nobody wanted to hear that
he hadn’t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have
noticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate. . . . Lee Jordan had
unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it
around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn’t get away; whenever he tried to sidle
over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks,
forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands. . . .
Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked
Dumbledore’s Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet....
“I didn’t,” he said, over and over again, “I don’t know how it happened.”
But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at
all.
“I’m tired!” he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour. “No, seriously,
George - I’m going to bed -“
He wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit of
sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he
needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they
attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake
everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could.
To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty
dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry slammed the door
behind him.
“Where’ve you been?” Harry said.
“Oh hello,” said Ron.
He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly
became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee
had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly.
Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.
“So,” he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a
corner. “Congratulations.”
“What d’you mean, congratulations?” said Harry, staring at Ron. There was
definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a
grimace.
“Well. . . no one else got across the Age Line,” said Ron. “Not even Fred and
George. What did you use - the Invisibility Cloak?”
“The Invisibility Cloak wouldn’t have got me over that line,” said Harry
slowly.
“Oh right,” said Ron. “I thought you might’ve told me if it was the cloak. . .
because it would’ve covered both of us, wouldn’t it? But you found another
way, did you?”
“Listen,” said Harry, “I didn’t put my name in that goblet. Someone else
must’ve done it.”
Ron raised his eyebrows.
“What would they do that for?”
“I dunno,” said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, “To
kill me.”
Ron’s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his
hair.
“It’s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth,” he said. “If you don’t want
everyone else to know, fine, but I don’t know why you’re bothering to lie, you
didn’t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady’s, that Violet,
she’s already told us all Dumbledore’s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons
prize money, eh? And you don’t have to do end-of-year tests either. . .”
“I didn’t put my name in that goblet!” said Harry, starting to feel angry.
“Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. “Only
you said this morning you’d have done it last night, and no one would’ve seen
you.. . . I’m not stupid, you know.”
“You’re doing a really good impression of it,” Harry snapped.
“Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his
face now. “You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you’ll need to be up early
tomorrow for a photo-call or something.”
He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing
there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the
few people he had been sure would believe him.
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN – THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS
When Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a moment to
remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the
previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his
own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him - only to
find that Ron’s bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.
Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common
room. The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast
broke into applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and
facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was
not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered
by the Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join
them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed
out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione.
“Hello,” she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. “I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?”
“Good idea,” said Harry gratefully.
They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at
the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where
the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly
morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione
exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night
before. To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.
“Well, of course I knew you hadn’t entered yourself,” she said when he’d
finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. “The look on
your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who did
put it in? Because Moody’s right, Harry... I don’t think any student could have
done it. . . they’d never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over Dumbledore’s -“
“Have you seen Ron?” Harry interrupted.
Hermione hesitated.
“Erm. . . yes. . . he was at breakfast,” she said.
“Does he still think I entered myself?”
“Well. . . no, I don’t think so . . . not really,” said Hermione awkwardly.
“What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?”
“Oh Harry, isn’t it obvious?” Hermione said despairingly. “He’s
jealous!”
“Jealous?” Harry said incredulously. “Jealous of what? He wants
to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?”
“Look,” said Hermione patiently, “it’s always you who gets all the attention,
you know it is. I know it’s not your fault,” she added quickly, seeing Harry
open his mouth furiously. “I know you don’t ask for it.. . but - well - you know,
Ron’s got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you’re his best
friend, and you’re really famous - he’s always shunted to one side whenever
people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose
this is just one time too many. . .
“Great,” said Harry bitterly. “Really great. Tell him from me I’ll swap any
time he wants. Tell him from me he’s welcome to it.... People gawping at my
forehead everywhere I go. . .”
“I’m not teiling him anything,” Hermione said shortly. “Tell him yourself. It’s
the only way to sort this out.”
“I’m not running around after him trying to make him grow up!” Harry said,
so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm. “Maybe he’ll
believe I’m not enjoying myself once I’ve got my neck broken or –“
“That’s not funny,” said Hermione quietly. “That’s not funny at all.” She
looked extremely anxious. “Harry, I’ve been thinking - you know what we’ve
got to do, don’t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?”
“Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the -“
“Write to Sirius. You’ve got to tell him what’s happened. He asked you to
keep him posted on everything that’s going on at Hogwarts. . . . It’s almost as if
he expected something like this to happen. I brought some parchment and a
quill out with me -“
“Come off it,” said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn’t be
overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted. “He came back to the country
just because my scar twinged. He’ll probably come bursting right into the castle
if I tell him someone’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament -“
“He’d want you to tell him,” said Hermione sternly. “He’s going
to find out anyway.”
“How?”
“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said Hermione, very
seriously. “This tournament’s famous, and you’re famous. I’ll be really
surprised if there isn’t anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. . . .
You’re already in half the books about You-Know-Who, you know.. . and
Sirius would rather hear it from you, I know he would.”
“Okay, okay, I’ll write to him,” said Harry, throwing his last piece
of toast into the lake. They both stood and watched it floating there for a
moment, before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the
surface. Then they returned to the castle.
“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they climbed the
stairs. “He told me not to use Hedwig again.”
“Ask Ron if you can borrow -“
“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly.
“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,”
said Hermione.
They went up to the Owlery. Hermione gave Harry a piece of
parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of
perches, looking at all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall
and wrote his letter.
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts, so here
goes - I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard Tournament’s
happening this year and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth
champion. I don’t who put my name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t.
The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something
about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest
since last night, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so he
simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote,
Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak - Harry
“Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his
robes. At this, Hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg.
“I can’t use you,” Harry told her, looking around for the school
owls. “I’ve got to use one of these.”
Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her
talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time he was
tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had flown off,
Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and
soared up into the rafters out of reach.
“First Ron, then you,” Harry said angrily. “This isn’t my fault.”
If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the
idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he
was. He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at
lessons - and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors,
thought Harry had entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors,
however, they did not seem impressed.
The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had
turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson
was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry
had stolen their champion’s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact
that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the
few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch.
Ernie Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on
very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs
at the same tray - though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the
Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip and smacked him hard in the
face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making
very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided
making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout
seemed distant with him - but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.
He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal
circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too -
the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion.
Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in
place.
“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment
he got within earshot of Harry. “Got your autograph books? Better get a
signature now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much longer. . . . Half
the Triwizard champions have died.. . how long d’you reckon you’re going to
last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.”
Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there,
because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower
of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class’s
horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing
one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for
each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only
good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely.
“Take this thing for a walk?” he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the
boxes. “And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting,
the blasting end, or the sucker?”
“Roun’ the middle,” said Hagrid, demonstrating. “Er - yeh might want ter put
on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus’ as an extra precaution, like. Harry - you come
here an’ help me with this big one....
Hagrid’s real intention, however, was totalk to Harry away from the rest of the
class. He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to
Harry and said, very seriously, “So - yer competin’, Harry. In the tournament.
School champion.”
“One of the champions,” Harry corrected him.
Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows.
“No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?”
“You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said Harry, concealing with difficulty the
rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid’s words.
“Course I do,” Hagrid grunted. “Yeh say it wasn’ you, an’ I believe yeh - an’
Dumbledore believes yer, an’ all.”
“Wish I knew who did do it,” said Harry bitterly.
The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now,
and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over three feet long, and
extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless, they had developed a
kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor. They looked like a cross between giant
scorpions and elongated crabs - but still without recognizable heads or eyes.
They had become immensely strong and very hard to control.
“Look like they’re havin’ fun, don’ they?” Hagrid said happily. Harry
assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly
weren’t; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts’ ends
would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one
person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back
on their feet.
“Ah, I don’ know, Harry,” Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back down at him
with a worried expression on his face. “School champion. . . everythin’ seems
ter happen ter you, doesn’ it?”
Harry didn’t answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to him. . . that was
more or less what Hermione had said as they had walked around the lake, and
that was the reason, according to her, that Ron was no longer talking to him.
The next few days were some of Harry’s worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had
ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year,
when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow
students. But Ron had been on his side then. He thought he could have coped
with the rest of the school’s behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a
friend, but he wasn’t going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn’t
want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all
sides.
He could understand the Hufflepuffs’ attitude, even if he didn’t like it; they had
their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults
from the Slytherins - he was highly unpopular there and always had been,
because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in
the Inter-House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have
found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong,
however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn
himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.
Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more
than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and
gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days,
Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had
been so keen to get Krum’s autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags
one lunchtime.
Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come
anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even
more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in
Professor Flitwick’s class that he was given extra homework - the only person
to get any, apart from Neville.
“It’s really not that difficult, Harry,” Hermione tried to reassure him as they left
Flitwick’s class - she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all
lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters,
wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes. “You just weren’t concentrating properly -
“
“Wonder why that was,” said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past,
surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as
though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt. “Still - never mind,
eh? Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon. . .”
Double Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was nothing
short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and
the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as
possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant
thing Harry could imagine. He had already struggled through one Friday’s
worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning “ignore them, ignore them,
ignore them” under her breath, and he couldn’t see why today should be any
better.
When he and Hermione arrived at Snape’s dungeon after lunch, they found the
Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large badge
on the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment Harry thought they were
S.P.E.W. badges - then he saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous
red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage:
SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY--
THE REAL HOGWARTS CHAMPION!
“Like them, Potter?” said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached. “And this isn’t
all they do - look!”
He pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be
replaced by another one, which glowed green:
POTTER STINKS!
The Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed their badges too,
until the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He
felt the heat rise in his face and neck.
“Oh very funny,” Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her gang
of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, “really witty.”
Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn’t laughing,
but he wasn’t sticking up for Harry either.
“Want one, Granger?” said Malfoy, holding out a badge to Hermione. “I’ve
got loads. But don’t touch my hand, now. I’ve just washed it, you see; don’t
want a Mudblood sliming it up.”
Some of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst
through a dam in his chest. He had reached for his wand before he’d thought
what he was doing. People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing
down the corridor.
“Harry!” Hermione said warningly.
“Go on, then, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand.
“Moody’s not here to look after you now - do it, if you’ve got the guts –“
For a split second, they looked into each other’s eyes, then, at exactly the same
time, both acted.
“Funnunculus!” Harry yelled.
“Densaugeo!” screamed Malfoy.
Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and
ricocheted off at angles -- Harry’s hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy’s hit
Hermione. Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly
boils were springing up - Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her
mouth.
“Hermione!”
Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry
turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione’s hand away from her face. It wasn’t a
pretty sight. Hermione’s front teeth - already larger than average - were now
growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as
her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin - panic-stricken, she
felt them and let out a terrified cry.
“And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly voice.
Snape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, “Explain.”
“Potter attacked me, sir -“
“We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry shouted.
“- and he hit Goyle - look -“
Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that
would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.
“Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.
“Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “Look!”
He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth - she was doing her best to hide
them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past
her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with
silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape’s back.
Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.”.
Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel
and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.
It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at the
same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the
confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling
him. He got the gist, however.
“Let’s see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points from Gryffindor and a
detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it’ll be a week’s
worth of detentions.”
Harry’s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape
into a thousand slimy pieces. He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the back of
the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table. Ron was shaking with
anger too - for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal
between them, but then Ron turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus
instead, leaving Harry alone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon,
Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his badge, smirking. POTTER
STINKS flashed once more across the room.
Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things
happening to him. . . . If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse. . . he’d
have Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching.
“Antidotes!” said Snape, looking around at them all, his cold black eyes
glittering unpleasantly. “You should all have prepared your recipes now. I
want you to brew them carefully, and then, we will be selecting someone on
whom to test one. . .”
Snape’s eyes met Harry’s, and Harry knew what was coming. Snape was going
to poison him. Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the
front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape’s greasy head - And then a
knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry’s thoughts.
It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and walked up
to Snape’s desk at the front of the room.
“Yes?” said Snape curtly.
“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.” Snape stared down
his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his eager face.
“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said Snape coldly. “He will
come upstairs when this class is finished.”
Colin went pink.
“Sir - sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said nervously. “All the champions have
got to go, I think they want to take photographs. . .”
Harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped Colin saying those
last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring
determinedly at the ceiling.
“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped. “Potter, leave your things here, I want
you back down here later to test your antidote.”
“Please, sir - he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked Cohn. “All the

“Very well!” said Snape. “Potter - take your bag and get out of my sight!”
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door. As he
walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from
every direction.
“It’s amazing, isn’t it, Harry?” said Colin, starting to speak the moment Harry
had closed the dungeon door behind him. “Isn’t it, though? You being
champion?”
“Yeah, really amazing,” said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into
the entrance hall. “What do they want photos for, Colin?”
“The Daily Prophet, I think!”
“Great,” said Harry dully. “Exactly what I need. More publicity.”
“Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the right room. Harry knocked
on the door and entered.
He was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been pushed away to
the back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle; three of them,
however, had been placed end-to-end in front of the blackboard and covered
with a long length of velvet. Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered
desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry
had never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes.
Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to
anybody. Cedric and Fheur were in conversation. Fheur looked a good deal
happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept throwing back her head so that
her long silvery hair caught the light. A paunchy man, holding a large black
camera that was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner of his
eye.
Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward.
“Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you come.. .
nothing to worry about, it’s just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the
judges will be here in a moment -“
“Wand weighing?” Harry repeated nervously.
“We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you
know, as they’re your most important tools in the tasks ahead,” said Bagman.
“The expert’s upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there’s going to be a
little photo shoot. This is Rita Skeeter,” he added, gesturing toward the witch in
magenta robes. “She’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily
Prophet. .. .“
“Maybe not that small, Ludo,” said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on Harry.
Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly
with her heavy-jawed face. She wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers
clutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails, painted crimson.
“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start?” she said to
Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. “The youngest champion, you know.
. . to add a bit of color?”
“Certainly!” cried Bagman. “That is - if Harry has no objection?”
“Er -“ said Harry.
“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had
Harry’s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of
the room again and opening a nearby door.
“We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she said. “Let’s see . . . ah,
yes, this is nice and cozy.”
It was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her.
“Come along, dear - that’s right - lovely,” said Rita Skeeter again, perching
herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a
cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness. “Let’s see
now. .”
She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles,
which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that they
could see what they were doing.
“You won’t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill? It leaves me free to
talk to you normally. ..”
“A what?” said Harry.
Rita Skeeter’s smile widened. Harry counted three gold teeth. She reached
again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acid-green quill and a roll of
parchment, which she stretched out between them on a crate of Mrs. Skower’s
All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her
mouth, sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright on
the parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering slightly.
“Testing. . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.”
Harry hooked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken,
the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment:
Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, who’s savage quill has punctured
many inflated reputations –
“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of
parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag. Now she leaned
toward Harry and said, “So, Harry... what made you decide to enter the
Triwizard Tournament?”
“Er -“ said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill. Even though he
wasn’t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could
make out a fresh sentence:
An ugly scar, souvenier of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face
of Harry Potter, whose eyes --
“Ignore the quill, Harry,” said Rita Skeeter firmly. Reluctantly Harry looked
up at her instead. “Now -- why did you decide to enter the tournament, Harry?”
“I didn’t,” said Harry. “I don’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire.
I didn’t put it in there.”
Rita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow.
“Come now, Harry, there’s no need to be scared of getting into trouble. We all
know you shouldn’t really have entered at all. But don’t worry about that. Our
readers hove a rebel.”
“But I didn’t enter,” Harry repeated. “I don’t know who -“
“How do you feel about the tasks ahead?” said Rita Skeeter. “Excited?
Nervous?”
“I haven’t really thought. . . yeah, nervous, I suppose,” said Harry. His insides
squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke.
“Champions have died in the past, haven’t they?” said Rita Skeeter briskly.
“Have you thought about that at all?”
“Well. . . they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year,” said Harry.
The quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back and forward as
though it were skating.
“Of course, you’ve looked death in the face before, haven’t you?” said Rita
Skeeter, watching him closely. “How would you say that’s affected you?”
“Er,” said Harry, yet again.
“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove
yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were
tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because – “
“I didn’t enter,” said Harry, starting to feel irritated.
“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over him.
“No,” said Harry.
“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing in the
Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?”
Harry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to know how his
parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching him
very intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the
quill had just written:
Tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he
can barely remember.
“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly.
Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was
pulled open. Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light. Albus
Dumbledore stood there, looking down at both of them, squashed into the
cupboard.
“Dumbledore!” cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight - but
Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the
box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita’s clawed fingers were hastily snapping
shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag. “How are you?” she said, standing up
and holding out one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore. “I hope you
saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of
Wizards’ Conference?”
“Enchantingly nasty,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. “I particularly
enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.”
Rita Skeeter didn’t look remotely abashed.
“I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned,
Dumbhedore, and that many wizards in the street –“
“I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita,” said
Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have to
discuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands is about to start, and it
cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.”
Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room.
The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat down
quickly next to Cedric, hooking up at the velvet-covered table, where four of the
five judges were now sitting - Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr.
Crouch, and Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner;
Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee,
suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the
parchment.
“May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?” said Dumbledore, taking his place at the
judges’ table and talking to the champions. “He will be checking your wands to
ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.”
Harry hooked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large,
pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before
- he was the wand-maker from whom Harry had bought his own wand over
three years ago in Diagon Alley.
“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said Mr.
Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.
Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Olhivander and handed him her wand.
he said.
He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a
number of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it chose to his eyes and
examined it carefully.
“Yes,” he said quietly, “nine and a half inches. . . inflexible.. rosewood.. . and
containing. . . dear me. . .“
“An ‘air from ze ‘ead of a veela,” said Fleur. “One of my grandmuzzer’s.”
So Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a mental note to tell Ron. . .
then he remembered that Ron wasn’t speaking to him.
“Yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, “yes, I’ve never used veela hair myself, of course.
I find it makes for rather temperamental to each his own, and
if this suits you..”
Mr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for
scratches or bumps; then he muttered, “Orchideous!” and a bunch of flowers
burst from the wand tip.
“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said Mr. Ollivander, scooping
up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand. “Mr. Diggory, you
next.”
Fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.
“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with much more
enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. “Yes, I remember it well.
Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn. . .
must have been seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked
his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches. . . ash. . . pleasantly springy. It’s in fine
treat it regularly?”
“Polished it last night,” said Cedric, grinning.
Harry hooked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all over it. He
gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously.
Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very
patronizing look, and he desisted.
Mr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip
of Cedric’s wand, pronounced himself satisfied, and then said, “Mr. Krum, if
you please.”
Viktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duck-footed, toward
Mr. Ollivander. He thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in
the pockets of his robes.
“Hmm,” said Mr. Olhivander, “this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I’m much
mistaken? A fine wand-maker, though the styling is never quite what I. . .
however. .”
He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his
eyes.
“Yes.. . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at Krum, who nodded.
“Rather thicker than one usually sees. . . quite rigid. . . ten and a quarter inches.
. . Avis!”
The hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun, and a number of small, twittering
birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight.
“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. “Which leaves. . .
Mr. Potter.”
Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. He handed over
his wand.
“Aaaah, yes,” said Mr. Ohlivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. “Yes,
yes, yes. How well I remember.”
Harry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had happened
yesterday....
Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr. Ollivander’s
shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements
and then started handing him wands to try. Harry had waved what felt like
every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him - this
one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single
feather from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that
Harry had been so compatible with this wand. “Curious,” he had said,
“curious,” and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Olhivander
explained that the phoenix feather in Harry’s wand had come from the same
bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort’s.
Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. He was very
fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort’s
wand was something it couldn’t help - rather as he couldn’t help being related
to Aunt Petunia. However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn’t about to
tell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes
Quill might just explode with excitement if he did.
Mr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry’s wand than anyone else’s.
Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it
back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.
“Thank you all,” said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges’ table. “You may
go back to your lessons now - or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to
dinner, as they are about to end –“
Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but
the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.
“Photos, Dumbledore, photos!” cried Bagman excitedly. “All the judges and
champions, what do you think, Rita?”
“Er - yes, let’s do those first,” said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry
again. “And then perhaps some individual shots.”
The photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into
shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn’t stand far enough
back to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else
stood around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it
an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to
this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. The
photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept
hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she
insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go.
Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn’t there - he supposed she was still
in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table,
then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on
Summoning Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across
Ron.
“You’ve had an owl,” said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was
pointing at Harry’s pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there.
“Oh - right,” said Harry.
“And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape’s dungeon,” said
Ron.
He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. For a moment,
Harry considered going after him - he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to talk to
him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing - but the lure of Sirius’s answer
was too strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and
unrolled it.
Harry –
I can’t say everything I would like to in a letter, it’s too risky
in case the owl is intercepted - we need to talk face-to-face. Can you ensure
that you are alone by the fire in Gryffindor Tower at one o’clock in the
morning on the 22nd ofNovember?
I know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while
you’re around Dumbledore and Moody I don’t think anyone will be able to
hurt you. However, someone seems to be having a good try. Entering you in
that tournament would have been very risky, especially right under
Dumbkdore’s nose.
Be on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about anything unusual. Let
me know about the 22nd ofNovember as quickly as you can.
Sirius
CHAPTER NINETEEN – THE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL
The prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all that
sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that
had never looked darker. The shock of finding himself school champion had
worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink
in. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were
crouching ahead of him hike some horrific monster, barring his path. He had
never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin,
which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup. Harry was finding it
hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his whole life had been
heading up to, and would finish with, the first task.
Admittedly, he didn’t see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better
about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in
front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be
something at the moment. Harry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be
beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested; and he and
Hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of
the common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the worst, they
were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn’t have to
resort to that - Filch would skin them alive.
In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the
castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard
Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament
as a highly colored life story of Harry. Much of the front page had been given
over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven)
had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang
champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and
Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.
The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning
feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter
had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn’t remember ever
saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard.
I suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know they’d be very proud of
me if they could see me now. . . . Yes, sometimes at night I still cry about them,
I’m not ashamed to admit it. . . . I know nothing will hurt me during the
tournament, because they’re watching over me. . .
But Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his “er’s” into long,
sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people about him too.
Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close friend, Colin Creevey, says
that Harry is rarely seen out of the company of one Hermione Granger, a
stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like Harry, is one of the top students in
the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people --
Slytherins, mainly -- quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering
comments.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”
“Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter? Or is
this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?”
“Hey - Harry!”
“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the
corridor, having had just about enough. “I’ve just been crying my eyes out over
my dead mum, and I’m just off to do a bit more. . .
“No - it was just - you dropped your quill.”
It was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.
“Oh - right - sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill back.
“Er. . . good luck on Tuesday,” she said. “I really hope you do well.”
Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid.
Hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she hadn’t
yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, Harry was full of admiration
for the way she was handling the situation.
“Stunningly pretty? Her?” Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first time she
had come face-to-face with Hermione after Rita’s article had appeared. “What
was she judging against - a chipmunk?”
“Ignore it,” Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air and
stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though she couldn’t hear them.
“Just ignore it, Harry.”
But Harry couldn’t ignore it. Ron hadn’t spoken to him at all since he had told
him about Snape’s detentions. Harry had half hoped they would make things
up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats’ brains in Snape’s
dungeon, but that had been the day Rita’s article had appeared, which seemed
to have confirmed Ron’s belief that Harry was really enjoying all the attention.
Hermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one to the other,
trying to force them to talk to each other, but Harry was adamant: He would
talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn’t put his name in the
Goblet of Fire and apologized for calling him a liar.
“I didn’t start this,” Harry said stubbornly. “It’s his problem.”
“You miss him!” Hermione said impatiently. “And I know he misses you -“
“Miss him?” said Harry. “I don’t miss him. . .
But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just
wasn’t the same as Ron. There was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging
around in the library when Hermione was your best friend. Harry still hadn’t
mastered Summoning Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a
block about them, and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help.
They consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their
lunchtimes.
Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and Harry wondered what he
was up to. Was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him through
the first task? Hermione often complained about Krum being there - not that he
ever bothered them - but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy
on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the noise distracting.
“He’s not even good-looking!” she muttered angrily, glaring at Krum’s sharp
profile. “They only like him because he’s famous! They wouldn’t look twice at
him if he couldn’t do that WonkyFaint thing -“
“Wronski Feint,” said Harry, through gritted teeth. Quite apart from liking to
get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine Ron’s
expression if he could have heard Hermione talking about Wonky-Faints.
It is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give
anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up. The days
until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to
work at double speed. Harry’s feeling of barely controlled panic was with him
wherever he went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the Daily
Prophet article.
On the Saturday before the first task, all students in the third year and above
were permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade. Hermione told Harry that it
would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit, and Harry didn’t need
much persuasion.
“What about Ron, though?” he said. “Don’t you want to go with him?”
“Oh. . . well.. .“ Hermione went slightly pink. “I thought we might meet up
with him in the Three Broomsticks. . . .“
“No,” said Harry flatly.
“Oh Harry, this is so stupid -“
“I’ll come, but I’m not meeting Ron, and I’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak.”
“Oh all right then. . .“ Hermione snapped, “but I hate talking to you in that
cloak, I never know if I’m looking at you or not.”
So Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went back downstairs,
and together he and Hermione set off for Hogsmeade.
Harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak; he watched other students walking
past them as they entered the village, most of them sporting Support Cedric
Diggory! badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and
nobody was quoting that stupid article.
“People keep looking at me now,” said Hermione grumpily as they came out of
Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large cream-filled chocolates. “They think
I’m talking to myself.”
“Don’t move your lips so much then.”
“Come on, please just take off your cloak for a bit, no one’s going to bother you
here.”
“Oh yeah?” said Harry. “Look behind you.”
Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the Three
Broomsticks pub. Talking in low voices, they passed right by Hermione
without hooking at her. Harry backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita
Skeeter from hitting him with her crocodile-skin handbag. When they were
gone, Harry said, “She’s staying in the village. I bet she’s coming to watch the
first task.”
As he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic. He didn’t
mention this; he and Hermione hadn’t discussed what was coming in the first
task much; he had the feeling she didn’t want to think about it.
“She’s gone,” said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the
street. “Why don’t we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it’s a
bit cold, isn’t it? You don’t have to talk to Ron!” she added irritably, correctly
interpreting his silence.
The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying
their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw
anywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all-wizard
village in Britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not
as adept as wizards at disguising themselves.
It was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case you
accidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions.
Harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while Hermione went to
buy drinks. On his way through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting
with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard
poke in the back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it.
Hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his
cloak.
“I look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own,” she muttered. “Lucky I
brought something to do.”
And she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of
S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his and Ron’s names at the top of the very short
list. It seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions
together, and Hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and
treasurer.
“You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in
S.P.E.W.,” Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around the pub.
“Yeah, right,” said Harry. He took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak.
“Hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuff?”
“When house-elves have decent wages and working conditions!” she hissed
back. “You know, I’m starting to think it’s time for more direct action. I
wonder how you get into the school kitchens?”
“No idea, ask Fred and George,” said Harry.
Hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his butterbeer,
watching the people in the pub. All of them looked cheerful and relaxed. Ernie
Macmillan and Hannah Abbot were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby
table; both of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges on their cloaks.
Right over by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw friends.
She wasn’t wearing a Cedric badge though. . . . This cheered up Harry very
slightly.
What wouldn’t he have given to be one of these peophe, sitting around laughing
and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework? He imagined how it
would have felt to be here if his name hadn’t come out of the Goblet of Fire.
He wouldn’t be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be
sitting with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining what
deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday.
He’d have been really hooking forward to it, watching them do whatever it
on Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the

He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen
Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but
excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she
looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat in
the library, poring over books.
Harry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease
slightly. He would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight was
the night they were meeting at the common room fire - assuming nothing went
wrong, as everything else had done
“Look, it’s Hagrid!” said Hermione.
The back of Hagrid’s enormous shaggy head - he had mercifully abandoned his
bunches - emerged over the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn’t spotted him
at once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid
had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip flask.
Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn’t seem to think much of this; she
was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around
them. Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew
better. Moody had told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts
lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was
so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended cup.
As Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave. He waved, then
remembered that Hagrid couldn’t see him. Moody, however, paused, his
magical eye on the corner where Harry was standing. He tapped Hagrid in the
small of the back (being unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to
him, and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward
Harry and Hermione’s table.
“All right, Hermione?” said Hagrid loudly.
“Hello,” said Hermione, smiling back.
Moody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought he was reading
the S.P.E.W. notebook, until he muttered, “Nice cloak, Potter.”
Harry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing from Moody’s
nose was particularly obvious at a few inches’ distance. Moody grinned.
“Can your eye - I mean, can you - ?“
“Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,” Moody said quietly. “And it’s
come in useful at times, I can tell you.”
Hagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew Hagrid couldn’t see him,
but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was there. Hagrid now bent down on
the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so
low that only Harry could hear it, “Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me
cabin. Wear that cloak.”
Straightening up, Hagrid said loudly, “Nice ter see yeh, Hermione,” winked,
and departed. Moody followed him.
“Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?” Harry said, very
surprised.
“Does he?” said Hermione, looking startled. “I wonder what he’s up to? I
don’t know whether you should go, Harry. . . .“ She looked nervously around
and hissed, “It might make you late for Sirius.”
It was true that going down to Hagrid’s at midnight would mean cutting his
meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig
down to Hagrid’s to tell him he couldn’t go - always assuming she would
consent to take the note, of course - Harry, however, thought it better just to be
quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know what
this might be; Hagrid had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night.
At half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had pretended to go up to bed
early, pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs
through the common room. Quite a few people were still in there. The Creevey
brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggory!
badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say Support Harry
Potter! instead. So far, however, all they had managed to do was get the badges
stuck on POTTER STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and
waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch. Then Hermione opened
the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had planned. He slipped past her
with a whispered “Thanks!” and set off through the castle.
The grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the lawn toward the lights
shining in Hagrid’s cabin. The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage
was also lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as he
knocked on Hagrid’s front door.
“You there, Harry?” Hagrid whispered, opening the door and looking around.
“Yeah,” said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his
head. “What’s up?”
“Got summat ter show yeh,” said Hagrid.
There was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid. He was wearing a
flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as
though he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but he had certainly attempted
to comb his hair - Harry could see the comb’s broken teeth tangled in it.
“What’re you showing me?” Harry said warily, wondering if the skrewts had
laid eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a
stranger in a pub.
“Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered with that cloak,” said
Hagrid. “We won’ take Fang, he won’ like it. . .
“Listen, Hagrid, I can’t stay long. . . . I’ve got to be back up at the castle by one
o’clock -“
But Hagrid wasn’t listening; he was opening the cabin door and striding off into
the night. Harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid
was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.
“Hagrid, what - ?“
“Shhh!” said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the
crossed golden wands.
Madame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her
massive shoulders. She smiled when she saw Hagrid.
“Ah, ‘Agrid . . . it is time?”
“Bong-sewer,” said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her
down the golden steps.
Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her his arm, and
they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime’s giant
winged horses, with Harry, totally bewildered, running to keep up with them.
Had Hagrid wanted to show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old
time he wanted.. . she wasn’t exactly hard to
But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because
after a while she said playfully, “Wair is it you are taking me, ‘Agrid?”
“Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said Hagrid gruffly, “worth seein’, trust me. On’y - don’ go
tellin’ anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh’re not s’posed ter know.”
“Of course not,” said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long black eyelashes.
And still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along
in their wake, checking his watch every now and then. Hagrid had some
harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius. If they didn’t
get there soon, he was going to turn around, go straight back to the castle, and
leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime.
But then - when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that
the castle and the lake were out of sight – Harry heard something. Men were
shouting up ahead. . . then came a deafening, earsplitting roar. . .
Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt. Harry
hurried up alongside them - for a split second, he thought he was seeing
bonfires, and men darting around them - and then his mouth fell open.
Dragons.
Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing onto their
hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and
snorting - torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open,
fanged mouths, fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks. There
was a silvery-blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the
wizards on the ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and
stamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes
around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air;
and a gigantic black one, more lizard-hike than the others, which was nearest to
them.
At least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control
them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks
and legs. Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of
the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with either fear or
rage, he couldn’t tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise, a yowling,
screeching scream.
“Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the
chain he was holding. “They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know!
I’ve seen this Horntail do forty!”
“Is’n’ it beautiful?” said Hagrid softly.
“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard. “Stunning Spells, on the count of three!”
Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.
“Stupefy!” they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the
darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons’ scaly
hides –
Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs;
its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of
flame, though still smoking - then, very slowly, it fell. Several tons of sinewy,
scaly-black dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn
made the trees behind him quake.
The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen
charges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the
chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the
ground with their wands.
“Wan’ a closer look?” Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly. The pair of
them moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed. The wizard who had
warned Hagrid not to come any closer turned, and Harry realized who it was:
Charlie Weasley.
“All right, Hagrid?” he panted, coming over to talk. “They should be okay
now - we put them out with a Sleeping Draft on the way here, thought it might
be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet - but, like you saw, they
weren’t happy, not happy at all -“
“What breeds you got here, Charlie?” said Hagrid, gazing at the closest
dragon, the black one, with something chose to reverence. Its eyes were still
just open. Harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled
black eyelid.
“This is a Hungarian Horntail,” said Charlie. “There’s a Common Welsh
Green over there, the smaller one -- a Swedish Short-Snout, that blue-gray --
and a Chinese Fireball, that’s the red.”
Charlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling away around the edge
of the enclosure, gazing at the stunned dragons.
“I didn’t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,” Charlie said, frowning. “The
champions aren’t supposed to know what’s coming - she’s bound to tell her
student, isn’t she?”
“Jus’ thought she’d like ter see ‘em,” shrugged Hagrid, still gazing, enraptured,
at the dragons.
“Really romantic date, Hagrid,” said Charlie, shaking his head.
“Four. . .“ said Hagrid, “so it’s one fer each o’ the champions, is it? What’ve
they gotta do - fight ‘em?”
“Just get past them, I think,” said Charlie. “We’ll be on hand if it gets nasty,
Extinguishing Spells at the ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don’t know
why. . . but I tell you this, I don’t envy the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious
thing. Its back end’s as dangerous as its front, look.”
Charlie pointed toward the Horntail’s tail, and Harry saw long, bronze-colored
spikes protruding along it every few inches.
Five of Charlie’s fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at that moment,
carrying a clutch of huge granite-gray eggs between them in a blanket. They
placed them carefully at the Horntail’s side. Hagrid let out a moan of longing.
“I’ve got them counted, Hagrid,” said Charlie sternly. Then he said, “How’s
Harry?”
“Fine,” said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.
“Just hope he’s still fine after he’s faced this lot,” said Charlie grimly, looking
out over the dragons’ enclosure. “I didn’t dare tell Mum what he’s got to do for
the first task; she’s already having kittens about him. . . .“ Charlie imitated his
mother’s anxious voice. “How could they let him enter that tournament, he’s
much too young! I thought they were all safe, I thought there was going to
be an age limit!’ She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him.
‘He still cries about his parents! Oh bless him, I never knew!”
Harry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn’t miss him,
with the attractions of four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he
turned silently and began to walk away, back to the castle.
He didn’t know whether he was glad he’d seen what was coming or not.
Perhaps this way was better. The first shock was over now. Maybe if he’d seen
the dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he would have passed out cold in
front of the whole school. . . but maybe he would anyway. .. . He was going to
be armed with his wand - which, just now, felt like nothing more than a narrow
strip of wood -- against a fifty-foot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, fire-breathing
dragon. And he had to get past it. With everyone watching. How?
Harry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under fifteen minutes
to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he couldn’t remember, ever,
wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now -- when, without
warning, he ran into something very solid.
Harry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the cloak around him. A
voice nearby said, “Ouch! Who’s there?”
Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still,
staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He recognized the
goatee. . . it was Karkaroff.
“Who’s there?” said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in the
darkness. Harry remained still and silent. After a minute or so, Karkaroff
seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around at
waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the
cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were.
Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as
he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back
toward Hogwarts.
He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had sneaked off his
ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be. He might even have
spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest together -
they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance. . . and now all Karkaroff had to
do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would know
what was in store for the champions.
By the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the unknown on
Tuesday was Cedric.
Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb
the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn’t dare slow down. . . .
He had less than five minutes to get up to the fire.
“Balderdash!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in
front of the portrait hole.
“If you say so,” she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, and the picture
swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was
deserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal, Hermione had
not needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.
Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair in
front of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only
source of light. Nearby, on a table, the Support Cedric Diggory! badges the
Creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight. They now
read POTTER REALLY STINKS. Harry looked back into the flames, and
jumped.
Sirius’s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn’t seen Mr. Diggory do
exactly this back in the Weasleys’ kitchen, it would have scared him out of his
wits. Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he
scrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, “Sirius -
how’re you doing?”
Sirius looked different from Harry’s memory of him. When they had said goodbye, Sirius’s face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long,
black, matted hair - but the hair was short and clean now, Sirius’s face was
fuller, and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had
of him, which had been taken at the Potters’ wedding.
“Never mind me, how are you?” said Sirius seriously.
“I’m -“ For a second, Harry tried to say “fine” - but he couldn’t do it. Before
he could stop himself, he was talking more than he’d talked in days - about how
no one believed he hadn’t entered the tournament of his own free will, how Rita
Skeeter had lied about him in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn’t walk down a
corridor without being sneered at - and about Ron, Ron not believing him,
Ron’s jealousy...
“. . . and now Hagrid’s just shown me what’s coming in the first task, and it’s
dragons, Sirius, and I’m a goner,” he finished desperately.
Sirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that had not yet lost the look that
Azkaban had given them - that deadened, haunted look He had let Harry talk
himself into silence without interruption, but now he said, “Dragons we can
deal with, Harry, but we’ll get to that in a minute - I haven’t got long here. . .
I’ve broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any
time. There are things I need to warn you about.”
“What?” said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches.. . . Surely
there could be nothing worse than dragons coming?
“Karkaroff,” said Sirius. “Harry, he was a Death Eater. You know what Death
Eaters are, don’t you?”
“Yes - he - what?”
“He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released. I’d bet
everything that’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year - to
keep an eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the
first place.”
“Karkaroff got released?” Harry said slowly - his brain seemed to be struggling
to absorb yet another piece of shocking information. “Why did they release
him?”
“He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,” said Sirius bitterly. “He said he’d
seen the error of his ways, and then he named names. . . he put a load of other
people into Azkaban in his place. . . . He’s not very popular in there, I can tell
you. And since he got out, from what I can tell, he’s been teaching the Dark
Arts to every student who passes through that school of his. So watch out for
the Durmstrang champion as well.”
“Okay,” said Harry slowly. “But. . . are you saying Karkaroff put my name in
the goblet? Because if he did, he’s a really good actor. He seemed furious
about it. He wanted to stop me from competing.”
“We know he’s a good actor,” said Sirius, “because he convinced the Ministry
of Magic to set him free, didn’t he? Now, I’ve been keeping an eye on the
Daily Prophet, Harry..”
“- you and the rest of the world,” said Harry bitterly.
“- and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman’s article last month,
Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she
says it was another false alarm,” Sirius said hastily, seeing Harry about to
speak, “but I don’t think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from
getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more
difficult with him around. And no one’s going to look into it too closely; MadEye’s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn’t mean he can’t still spot
the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had.”
“So. . . what are you saying?” said Harry slowly. “Karkaroff’s trying to kill
me? But - why?”
Sirius hesitated.
“I’ve been nearing some very strange things,” he said slowly. “The Death
Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves
at the Quidditch World Cup, didn’t they? Someone set off the Dark Mark.. .
and then - did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who’s gone
missing?”
“Bertha Jorkins?” said Harry.
“Exactly. . . she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where Voldemort
was rumored to be last. . . and she would have known the Triwizard
Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?”
“Yeah, but. . . it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into Voldemort, is
it?” said Harry.
“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly. “She was at Hogwarts
when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very
nosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not a good combination, Harry. I’d say
she’d be very easy to lure into a trap.”
“So. . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said Harry.
“Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders?”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know...Karkaroff doesn’t strike
me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was
powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that goblet did
it for a reason, and I can’t help thinking the tournament would be a very good
way to attack you and make it hook like an accident.”
“Looks hike a really good plan from where I’m standing,” said Harry grinning
bleaky. “They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff.”
“Right - these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. “There’s a
way, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell - dragons are strong and
too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about
half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon -“
“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.
“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is away, and a simple spell’s all
you need. Just -“
But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as though
it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind
him.
“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “ Go! There’s someone coming!”
Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire - if someone saw Sirius’s face within
the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar - the Ministry
would get dragged in - he, Harry, would be questioned about Sirius’s
whereabouts –
Harry heard a tiny pop! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius had gone. He
watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a stroll at
one o’clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past
a dragon?
It was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped dead facing
Harry across the room, and looked around.
“Who were you talking to?” he said.
“What’s that got to do with you?” Harry snarled. “What are you doing down
here at this time of night?”
“I just wondered where you -“ Ron broke off, shrugging. “Nothing. I’m going
back to bed.”
“Just thought you’d come nosing around, did you?” Harry shouted. He knew
that Ron had no idea what he’d walked in on, knew he hadn’t done it on
purpose, but he didn’t care - at this moment he hated everything about Ron,
right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama
trousers.
“Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with anger. “Should’ve
realized you didn’t want to be disturbed. I’ll let you get on with practicing for
your next interview in peace.”
Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and
chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead and
bounced off.
“There you go,” Harry said. “Something for you to wear on Tuesday. You
might even have a scar now, if yon’re lucky.. . . That’s what you want, isn’t it?”
He strode across the room toward the stairs; he half expected Ron to stop him,
he would even have liked Ron to throw a punch at him, but Ron just stood there
in his too-small pajamas, and Harry, having stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed
fuming for a long time afterward and didn’t hear him come up to bed.
CHAPTER TWENTY – THE FIRST TASK
Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it
was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead
of his sock. When he’d finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body,
he hurried off to find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great
Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too queasy to eat,
Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then
dragged her out onto the grounds. There, he told her all about the dragons, and
about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the
lake.
Alarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about Karkaroff,
Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem.
“Let’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening,” she said desperately,
“and then we can worry about Karkaroff.”
They walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a
simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to
them, so they retired to the library instead. Here, Harry pulled down every
book he could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through
the large pile.
“Talon-clipping by charms. .. treating scale-rot. . .‘ This is no good, this is for
nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy. ..
“Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that
imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can
penetrate. . .‘ But Sirius said a simple one would do it.. .
“Let’s try some simple spellbooks, then,” said Harry, throwing aside Men Who
Love Dragons Too Much.
He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down, and began to
flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.
“Well, there are Switching Spells. . . but what’s the point of Switching it?
Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it
less dangerous.. . . The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get
through a dragon’s hide. . . . I’d say Transfigure it, but something that big, you
really haven’t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall. . . unless you’re
supposed to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers?
But they’re not simple spells, I mean, we haven’t done any of those in class, I
only know about them because I’ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . .“
“Hermione,” Harry said, through gritted teeth, “will you shut up for a bit,
please? I m trying to concentrate.”
But all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that Harry’s brain filled
with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn’t seem to allow room for
concentration. He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the
Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping. . . but dragons had no hair. . . pepper
breath.. . that would probably increase a dragon’s firepower. . . horn tongue. . .
just what he needed, to give it an extra weapon...
“Oh no, he’s back again, why can’t he read on his stupid ship?” said Hermione
irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly look over at the pair of them,
and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books. “Come on, Harry,
we’ll go back to the common room. . . his fan club’ll be here in a moment,
twittering away... .“
And sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed past them, one
of them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her waist.
Harry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he
seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts.
But as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about
what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn’t do it. It was the only
place he had ever been happy. . . well, he supposed he must have been happy
with his parents too, but he couldn’t remember that.
Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than
back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly
calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn’t working too
well), and as he and Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the
Hufflepuff table.
Cedric still didn’t know about the dragons. . . the only champion who didn’t, if
Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur
and Krum....
“Hermione, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” Harry said, coming to his decision
as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. “Go on, I’ll catch you up.”
“Harry, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring -“
“I’ll catch you up, okay?”
By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric was at the
top. He was with a load of sixth-year friends. Harry didn’t want to talk to
Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting Rita
Skeeter’s article at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a
distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave
Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and
took careful aim.
“Diffindo!”
Cedric’s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor.
Several bottles of ink smashed.
“Don’t bother,” said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to
help him. “Tell Flitwick I’m coming, go on. . .
This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand back
into his robes, waited until Cedric’s friends had disappeared into their
classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but
himself and Cedric.
“Hi,” said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration
that was now splattered with ink. “My bag just split. . . brand-new and all. . .“
“Cedric,” said Harry, “the first task is dragons.”
“What?” said Cedric, looking up.
“Dragons,” said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out
to see where Cedric had got to. “They’ve got four, one for each of us, and
we’ve got to get past them.”
Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he’d been feeling since
Saturday night flickering in Cedric’s gray eyes.
“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.
“Dead sure,” said Harry. “I’ve seen them.”
“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to know. . . .“
“Never mind,” said Harry quickly - he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he
told the truth. “But I’m not the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will
know by now - Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too.”
Cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and books, his
ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a
puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.
“Why are you telling me?” he asked.
Harry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn’t have asked that
if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn’t have let his worst enemy
face those monsters unprepared - well, perhaps Malfoy or Snape...
“It’s just . . . fair, isn’t it?” he said to Cedric. “We all know now. . . we’re on
an even footing, aren’t we?”
Cedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when Harry heard a
familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned around and saw Mad-Eye
Moody emerging from a nearby classroom.
“Come with me, Potter,” he growled. “Diggory, off you go.”
Harry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them?
“Er - Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology -“
“Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please...
Harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now. What if
Moody wanted to know how he’d found out about the dragons? Would Moody
go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a ferret? Well, it
might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully,
he’d be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet..
He followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them and
turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal
one.
“That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,” Moody said quietly.
Harry didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the reaction he had expected at all.
“Sit down,” said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around.
He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In Professor
Lockhart’s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of
Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely
to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had
procured for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a
number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in
the days when he had been an Auror.
On his desk stood what looked hike a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry
recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though
it was much smaller than Moody’s. In the corner on a small table stood an
object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It
was humming slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on
the wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving
around inside it, none of them clearly in focus.
“Like my Dark Detectors, do you?” s aid Moody, who was watching Harry
closely.
“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial.
“Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies.. . no use here,
of course, too much interference - students in every direction lying about why
they haven’t done their homework Been humming ever since I got here. I had
to disable my Sneakoscope because it wouldn’t stop whistling. It’s extrasensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking up
more than kid stuff,” he added in a growl.
“And what’s the mirror for?”
“Oh that’s my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around? I’m not really
in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That’s when I open my trunk.”
He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the
window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in there,
until Moody’s next question brought him sharply back to earth.
“So. . . found out about the dragons, have you?”
Harry hesitated. He’d been afraid of this - but he hadn’t told Cedric, and he
certainly wasn’t going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.
“It’s all right,” said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with
a groan. “Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always
has been.”
“I didn’t cheat,” said Harry sharply. “It was - a sort of accident that I found
out.”
Moody grinned. “I wasn’t accusing you, laddie. I’ve been telling Dumbledore
from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you can bet old
Karkaroff and Maxime won’t be. They’ll have told their champions everything
they can. They want to win. They want to beat Dumbledore. They’d like to
prove he’s only human.”
Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it
made Harry feel queasy to watch it.
“So. . . got any ideas how you’re going to get past your dragon yet?” said
Moody.
“No,” said Harry.
“Well, I’m not going to tell you,” said Moody gruffly. “I don’t show
favoritism, me. I’m just going to give you some good, general advice. And the
first bit is - play to your strengths.”
“I haven’t got any,” said Harry, before he could stop himself. “Excuse me,”
growled Moody, “you’ve got strengths if I say you’ve got them. Think now.
What are you best at?”
Harry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy, really --
“Quidditch,” he said dully, “and a fat lot of help -“
“That’s right,” said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely
moving at all. “You’re a damn good flier from what I’ve heard.”
“Yeah, but.. .“ Harry stared at him. “I’m not allowed a broom, I’ve only got
my
“My second piece of general advice,” said Moody loudly, interrupting him, “is
to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.”
Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need?
“Come on, boy. . .“ whispered Moody. “Put them together... it’s not that

And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the air.
For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Fire-bolt, he needed –
“Hermione,” Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes
later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her.
“Hermione - I need you to help me.”
“What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she whispered back, her
eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was
pruning.
“Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by
tomorrow afternoon.”
And so they practiced. They didn’t have lunch, but headed for a free classroom,
where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room
toward him. He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing
heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor.
“Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .“
“What d’you think I’m trying to do?” said Harry angrily. “A great big dragon
keeps popping up in my head for some try again. . . .“
He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused pointblank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her.
He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half
the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at
that moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of sudden,
violent deaths.
“Well, that’s good,” said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him,
“just as long as it’s not drawn-out. I don’t want to suffer.”
Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught
Harry’s eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful
toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small
objects toward him under the table with his wand. He managed to make a fly
zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn’t entirely sure that was his prowess
at Summoning Charms - perhaps the fly was just stupid.
He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty
classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers.
They kept practicing until past midnight. They would have stayed longer, but
Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at
him, started chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a
hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common
room, which was now mercifully empty.
At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by
heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones,
and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang
of the Summoning Charm.
“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted
but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” Harry said,
throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, “threaten
me with a dragon. He raised his wand once more. “Accio
Dictionary!”
The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and
Harry caught it.
“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.
“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The Firebolt’s going to be
much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m
going to be out there on the grounds. . . .“
“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly.“ Just as long as you’re
concentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come. Harry, we’d better get some
sleep.. . you’re going to need it.”
Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that
evening that some of his blind panic had heft him. It returned in full measure,
however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of
great tension and excitement. Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the
students time to get down to the dragons’ enclosure - though of course, they
didn’t yet know what they would find there.
Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing
him good luck or hissing “We’ll have a box of tissues ready, Potter” as he
passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he
mightn’t just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and
start trying to curse everyone in sight. Time was behaving in a more peculiar
fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed
to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking
into lunch.. . and then (where had the morning gone? the last of the dragon-free
hours?), Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall.
Lots of people were watching.
“Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now... . You have
to get ready for your first task.”
“Okay,” said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter.
“Good luck, Harry,” Hermione whispered. “You’ll be fine!”
“Yeah,” said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own.
He heft the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn’t seem herself
either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him
down the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her
hand on his shoulder.
“Now, don’t panic,” she said, “just keep a cool head. . . . We’ve got wizards
standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . . . The main thing is
just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you. . . . Are you all
right?”
“Yes,” Harry heard himself say. “Yes, I’m fine.”
She was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge
of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the
enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a tent had been erected, its
entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.
“You’re to go in here with the other champions,” said Professor McGonagall, in
a rather shaky sort of voice, “and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in
there. . . he’ll be telling you the - the procedure. . . . Good luck.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of the
tent. Harry went inside.
Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool. She didn’t look
nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum looked
even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves.
Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small
smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather
hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it.
“Harry! Good-o!” said Bagman happily, looking around at him. “Come in,
come in, make yourself at home!”
Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing
amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.
“Well, now we’re all here – time to fill you in!” said Bagman brightly. “When
the audience has assembled, I’m going to be offering each of you this bag” - he
held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them - “from which you will
each select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different
- er - varieties, you see. And I have to tell you something else too.. . ah, yes...
your task is to collect the golden egg!”
Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood
Bagman’s words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he looked
slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn’t reacted at all. Perhaps they
thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how
Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for this. .
And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard
passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. . . . Harry felt
as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species. And then -
it seemed like about a second later to Harry - Bagman was opening the neck of
the purple silk sack.
“Ladies first,” he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.
She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a
dragon - a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck And Harry
knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined
resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was
coming.
The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had
a number three around its neck. He didn’t even blink, just sat back down and
stared at the ground.
Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray Swedish ShortSnout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put
his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the
number four. It stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its
minuscule fangs.
“Well, there you are!” said Bagman. “You have each pulled out the dragon
you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the
dragons, do you see? Now, I’m going to have to leave you in a moment,
because I’m commentating. Mr. Diggory, you’re first, just go out into the
enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right? Now. . . Harry. . . could I have a
quick word? Outside?”
“Er. . . yes,” said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with
Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then turned
to him with a fatherly expression on his face.
“Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?”
“What?” said Harry. “I - no, nothing.”
“Got a plan?” said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. “Because I
don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know. I mean,”
Bagman continued, lowering his voice still further, “you’re the underdog here,
Harry. . . . Anything I can do to help. . .“
“No,” said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, “no - I - I know
what I’m going to do, thanks.”
“Nobody would know, Harry,” said Bagman, winking at him.
“No, I’m fine,” said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and
wondering whether he had ever been less fine. “I’ve got a plan worked out, I -“
A whistle had blown somewhere.
“Good lord, I’ve got to run!” said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off.
Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener than
ever. Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came out of his
mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.
Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds hater, they heard the roar
of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure and was now faceto-face with the living counterpart of his model.
It was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and listening.
The crowd screamed. . . yelled.. . gasped like a single many-headed entity, as
Cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the Swedish Short-Snout. Krum
was still staring at the ground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric’s steps,
around and around the tent. And Bagman’s commentary made everything
much, much worse.. . . Horrible pictures formed in Harry’s mind as he heard:
“Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow”. . . “He’s taking risks, this one!”. . .
“Clever move - pity it didn’t work!”
And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could
mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden
egg.
“Very good indeed!” Bagman was shouting. “And now the marks from the
judges!”
But he didn’t shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges were holding
them up and showing them to the crowd.
“One down, three to go!” Bagman yelled as the whistle blew again. “Miss
Delacour, if you please!”
Fleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly toward her than
he had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand
clutching her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at opposite sides of the tent,
avoiding each other’s gaze.
The same process started again. . . .“Oh I’m not sure that was wise!” they
could hear Bagman shouting gleefully. “Oh. . . nearly! Careful now. . . good
lord, I thought she’d had it then!”
Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more. . . .
Fleur must have been successful too. A pause, while Fleur’s marks were being
shown. . . more clapping.. . then, for the third time, the whistle.
“And here comes Mr. Krum!” cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out, leaving
Harry quite alone.
He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his
heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear. . . yet at the same
time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing
the crowd, as though from far away.
“Very daring!” Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball
emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath.
“That’s some nerve he’s showing - and - yes, he’s got the egg!”
Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had finished - it
would be Harry’s turn any moment.
He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow.
He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out through the
entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. And now he
was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence.
He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream.
There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands
that had been magicked there since he’d last stood on this spot. And there was
the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of
eggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly,
black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, heaving yard-long gouge marks in the
hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly
or not, Harry didn’t know or care. It was time to do what he had to do. . . to
focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance.
He raised his wand.
“Accio Firebolt!” he shouted.
Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn’t worked. . . if it
wasn’t coming. . . He seemed to be looking at everything around him through
some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the
enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim
And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw
his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the
enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount.
The crowd was making even more noise. . . . Bagman was shouting something. .
. but Harry’s ears were not working properly anymore. . . listening wasn’t

He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. And a second
later, something miraculous happened....
As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd’s faces
became mere flesh-colored pinpnicks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size
of a dog, he realized that he had heft not only the ground behind, but also his
fear. . . . He was back where he belonged....
This was just another Quidditch match, that was all. . . just another Quidditch
match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team.
He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming
against its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon’s front
legs. “Okay,” Harry told himself, “diversionary tactics. . . let’s go. . .”
He dived. The Horntail’s head followed him; he knew what it was going to do
and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly
where he would have been had he not swerved away. . . but Harry didn’t care.. .
that was no more than dodging a Bludger.
“Great Scott, he can fly!” yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped.
“Are you watching this, Mr. Krum?”
Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following his
progress; its head revolving on its long neck - if he kept this up, it would be
nicely dizzy - but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again
–
Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but this
time he was less lucky - he missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to
meet him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed his
shoulder, ripping his robes --
He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans from
the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be deep. . . . Now he zoomed around the
back of the Horntail, and a possibility occurred to
The Horntail didn’t seem to want to take off, she was too protective
of her eggs. Though she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling her wings
and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid to move too
far from them. . . but he had to persuade her to do it, or he’d never get near
them. . . . The trick was to do it carefully,
He began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to
make her breathe fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient threat to
ensure she kept her eyes on him. Her head swayed this way and that, watching
him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs bared...
He flew higher. The Horntail’s head rose with him, her neck now
stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, hike a snake before its charmer. . .
Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation.
He was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail thrashed again,
but he was too high to reach now. . . . She shot fire into the air, which he
dodged.. . . Her jaws opened
“Come on,” Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, “come on, come
and get me. . . up you get now. .”
And then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at last, as wide
as those of a small airplane - and Harry dived. Before the dragon knew what he
had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground
as fast as he could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs
- he had taken his hands off his Firebolt - he had seized the golden egg –
And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the stands,
the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though somebody
had just turned the volume back up - for the first time, he became properly
aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly
as the Irish supporters at the World Cup –
“Look at that!” Bagman was yelling. “Will you look at that! Our youngest
champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on
Mr. Potter!”
Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail, and, over
at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor McGonagalh, Professor Moody, and
Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him toward them, their smiles
evident even from this distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of the
crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his heart lighter
than it had been in weeks. . . . He had got through the first task, he had
survived.
“That was excellent, Potter!” cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the
Firebolt - which from her was extravagant praise. He noticed that her hand
shook as she pointed at his shoulder. “You’ll need to see Madam Pomfrey
before the judges give out your score. . . . Over there, she’s had to mop up
Diggory already. . . .“
“Yeh did it, Harry!” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Yeh did it! An’ agains’ the
Horntail an’ all, an’ yeh know Charlie said that was the wors’ – “
“Thanks, Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn’t blunder on and
reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand.
Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its
socket.
“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.
“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please. . .“ said Professor McGonagall.
Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey
standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.
“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was
divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas,
but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam
Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while. “Last year
dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next?
You’re very lucky. . . this is quite shallow. . . it’ll need cleaning before I heal it
up, though... .“
She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but
then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.
“Now, just sit quietly for a minute - sit! And then you can go and get your
score.”
She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say, “How does it
feel now, Diggory?”
Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet,
wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d reached the mouth of
the tent, two people had come darting inside - Hermione, followed closely by
Ron.
“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily. There were fingernail
marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear. “You were amazing!
You really were!”
But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring at Harry as
though he were a ghost.
“Harry,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your name in that goblet - I - I
reckon they’re trying to do you in!”
It was as though the last few weeks had never happened - as though Harry were
meeting Ron for the first time, right after he’d been made champion.
“Caught on, have you?” said Harry coldly. “Took you long enough.”
Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other. Ron
opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologize and
suddenly he found he didn’t need to hear it.
“It’s okay,” he said, before Ron could get the words out. “Forget it.”
“No,” said Ron, “I shouldn’t’ve -“
“Forget it, “Harry said.
Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back
Hermione burst into tears.
“There’s nothing to cry about!” Harry told her, bewildered.
“You two are so stupid!” she shouted, stamping her foot on the ground, tears
splashing down her front. Then, before either of them could stop her, she had
given both of them a hug and dashed away, now positively howling.
“Barking mad,” said Ron, shaking his head. “Harry, c’mon, they’ll be putting
up your scores. . . .“
Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated than he would
have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron by his
side, talking fast.
“You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this weird thing
where he Transfigured a rock on the ground. . . turned it into a dog. . . he was
trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a pretty
cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg,
but he got burned as well - the dragon changed its mind halfway through and
decided it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away. And
that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a
trance - well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and
this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire - she put it out with a bit
of water out of her wand. And Krum - you won’t believe this, but he didn’t
even think of flying! He was probably the best after you, though. Hit it with
some sort of spell right in the eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in
agony and squashed half the real eggs - they took marks off for that, he wasn’t
supposed to do any damage to them.”
Ron drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure. Now that
the Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see where the five judges were
sitting - right at the other end, in raised seats draped in gold.
“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and Harry squinting up the
field, saw the first judge - Madame Maxime - raise her wand in the air. What
hooked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which twisted itself into a large
figure eight.
“Not bad!” said Ron as the crowd applauded. “I suppose she took marks off for
your shoulder. . .
Mr. Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into the air.
“Looking good!” Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.
Next, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd was cheering harder than
ever.
Ludo Bagman - ten.
“Ten?” said Harry in disbelief. “But. . . I got hurt. . . . What’s he playing at?”
“Harry, don’t complain!” Ron yelled excitedly.
And now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a moment, and then a
number shot out of his wand too - four.
“What?” Ron bellowed furiously. “Four? You lousy, biased scum-bag, you
gave Krum ten!”
But Harry didn’t care, he wouldn’t have cared if Karkaroff had given him zero;
Ron’s indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him. He
didn’t tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to
leave the enclosure. And it wasn’t just Ron. . . those weren’t only Gryffindors
cheering in the crowd. When it had come to it, when they had seen what he was
facing, most of the school had been on his side as well as Cedric’s. . . . He didn’t
care about the Slytherins, he could stand whatever they threw at him now.
“You’re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!” said Charlie Weasley,
hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school. “Listen, I’ve got
to run, I’ve got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I’d tell her what happened
- but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah - and they told me to tell you you’ve got
to hang around for a few more minutes.. . . Bagman wants a word, back in the
champions’ tent.”
Ron said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which somehow looked
quite different now: friendly and welcoming. He thought back to how he’d felt
while dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the long wait before he’d
walked out to face it.... There was no comparison; the wait had been
immeasurably worse.
Fleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One side of Cedric’s face was
covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn. He
grinned at Harry when he saw him.
“Good one, Harry.”
“And you,” said Harry, grinning back.
“Well done, all of you!” said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the tent and looking
as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon. “Now, just a
quick few words. You’ve got a nice long break before the second task, which
will take place at half past nine on the morning of February the twenty-fourth -
but we’re giving you something to think about in the meantime! If you look
down at those golden eggs you’re all holding, you will see that they open. . . see
the hinges there? You need to solve the clue inside the egg - because it will tell
you what the second task is, and enable you to prepare for it! All clear? Sure?
Well, off you go, then!”
Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back around the edge
of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had
done in more detail. Then, as they rounded the clump of trees behind which
Harry had first heard the dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.
It was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes today; the Quick-Quotes
Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.
“Congratulations, Harry!” she said, beaming at him. “I wonder if you could
give me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How you feel now,
about the fairness of the scoring?”
“Yeah, you can have a word,” said Harry savagely. “Good-bye.”
And he set off back to the castle with Ron.
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE – THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT
Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to
find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had
managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on
everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear
that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron
was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along.
“Fits, doesn’t it?” he said. “Remember what Malfoy said on the
train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they
knew each other. They were probably running around in masks together at the
World Cup.... I’ll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put
your name in the goblet, he’s going to be feeling really stupid now, isn’t he?
Didn’t work, did it? You only got a scratch! Come here - I’ll do it -“
Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around
and around Harry’s head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of
the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg.
“There’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how
could they be?” Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. “You
know what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I’m serious.”
Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the
last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however, leaned
against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron.
“Harry’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,” she said
seriously. “If that was the first task, I hate to think what’s coming next.”
“Right little ray of sunshine, aren’t you?” said Ron. “You and Professor
Trelawney should get together sometime.”
He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet
before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was
much longer and heavier than usual - Harry hadn’t been able to resist giving
Sirius a blow-by-blow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and
dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness,
and then Ron said, “Well, we’d better get downstairs for your surprise party,
Harry - Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by
now.”
Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with
cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin
juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster’s
Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas,
who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most
of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail’s head on his Firebolt,
though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire.
Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel
properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t believe
how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d gotten through the first
task, and he wouldn’t have to face the second one for three months.
“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which
Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. “Open it, Harry, go on!
Let’s just see what’s inside it!”
“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said swiftly. “It’s
in the tournament rules. . . .“
“I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,” Harry
muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.
“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed.
Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran
all the way around it and prised it open.
It was hollow and completely empty - but the moment Harry opened it, the most
horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing
to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s
deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.
“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.
“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed
it shut again. “Sounded like a banshee Maybe you’ve got to get past one of
those next, Harry!”
"It was someone being tortured!" said Neville, who had gone very white and
spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. "You're going to have to fight the
Cruciatus Curse!"
"Don't be a prat, Neville, that's illegal," said George. "They wouldn't use the
Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing
. .. maybe you've got to attack him while he's in the shower. Harry."
"Want a jam tart, Hermione?" said Fred.
Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred grinned.
"It's all right," he said. "I haven't done anything to them. It's the custard creams
you've got to watch -"
Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out. Fred
laughed.
"Just my little joke, Neville.. . ."
Hermione took a jam tart. Then she said, "Did you get all this from the
kitchens, Fred?"
"Yep," said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak and imitated
a house-elf. "'Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!' They're dead
helpful... get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish."
"How do you get in there?" Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice.
"Easy," said Fred, "concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just
tickle the pear, and it giggles and -" He stopped and looked suspiciously at her.
"Why?"
"Nothing," said Hermione quickly.
"Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you?" said
George. "Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into
rebellion?"
Several people chortled. Hermione didn't answer.
"Don't you go upsetting them and telling them they've got to take clothes and
salaries!" said Fred warningly. "You'll put them off their cooking!"
Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary.
"Oh - sorry, Neville!" Fred shouted over all the laughter. "I forgot - it was the
custard
creams we hexed -"
Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen
off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in laughing.
"Canary Creams!" Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. "George and I invented
them - seven Sickles each, a bargain!"
It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory
with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his fourposter shut. Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table
next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry
thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a
point.. . they were all right, really, dragons. . . .
The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty though the
castle always was in winter. Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every
time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high
winds, its black sails billowing
against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be
pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime's horses
well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes
wafting from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the
entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as
they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them.
"I'm not sure whether they hibernate or not," Hagrid told the shivering class in
the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. "Thought we'd jus' try an see if they
fancied a kip . . . we'll jus' settle 'em down in these boxes. . . ."
There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another
had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet
in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful, scuttling legs; their fireblasting ends; their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the
most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the
enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy
blankets.
"We'll jus' lead 'em in here," Hagrid said, "an' put the lids on, and we'll see what
happens."
But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being
forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, "Don
panic, now, don' panic!" while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin
patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class
- Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead - had fled into Hagrid's cabin through
the back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione,
however, were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid.
Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the
cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.
"Don’ frighten him, now!" Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands
to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on
them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. "Jus' try an slip the rope 'round
his sting, so he won hurt any o' the others!"
"Yeah, we wouldn't want that!" Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed
into the wall of Hagrid's cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.
"Well, well, well. . . this does look like fun."
Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid's garden fence, looking in at the mayhem.
She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and
her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.
Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry
and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the
pumpkin plants nearby.
"Who're you?" Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around
the skrewt's sting and tightened it.
“Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter," Rita replied, beaming at him. Her gold
teeth glinted.
"Thought Dumbledore said you weren' allowed inside the school anymore,"
said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and
started tugging it over to its fellows.
Rita acted as though she hadn't heard what Hagrid had said.
"What are these fascinating creatures called?" she asked, beaming still more
widely.
"Blast-Ended Skrewts," grunted Hagrid.
"Really?" said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. "I've never heard of them
do they come from?"
Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid's wild black beard, and
his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who
seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly, "They're very interesting,
aren't they? Aren't they. Harry?"
"What? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting," said Harry as she stepped on his foot.
"Ah, you're here. Harry!" said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. "So you
like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?"
"Yes," said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.
"Lovely," said Rita. "Really lovely. Been teaching long?" she added to Hagrid.
Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one
cheek). Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing
several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class
stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.
"This is o'ny me second year," said Hagrid.
"Lovely... I don't suppose you'd like to give an interview, would you? Share
some of your experience of magical creatures? The Prophet does a zoological
column every Wednesday, as I'm sure you know. We could feature these - er -
Bang-Ended Scoots."
"Blast-Ended Skrewts," Hagrid said eagerly. "Er - yeah, why not?"
Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of
communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and
watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the
Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. Then the bell
rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.
"Well, good-bye, Harry!" Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with
Ron and Hermione. "Until Friday night, then, Hagrid!"
"She'll twist everything he says," Harry said under his breath.
"Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything," said
Hermione desperately. They looked at one another - it was exactly the sort of
thing Hagrid might do.
"Hagrids been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledores never sacked him,"
said Ron consolingly. "Worst that can happen is Hagrid'll have to get rid of the
skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best."
Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to
lunch.
Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still
doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once
more, the whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor Trelawney, who had
been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own
horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her
explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.
"I would think," she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious
annoyance, "that some of us" - she stared very meaningfully at Harry- "might
be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal
gazing last night. As I sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult
the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its
crystalline depths . . . and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?"
"An ugly old bat in outsize specs?" Ron muttered under his breath.
Harry fought hard to keep his face straight.
"Death, my dears."
Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified.
"Yes," said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, "it comes, ever closer,
it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower. . . ever lower over the castle. . . ."
She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously.
"It'd be a bit more impressive if she hadn't done it about eighty times before,"
Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath
Professor Trelawney's room. "But if I'd dropped dead every time she's told me
I'm going to, I'd be a medical miracle."
"You'd be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost," said Ron, chortling, as they
passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring
sinisterly. "At least we didn't get homework. I hope Hermione got loads off
Professor Vector, I love not working when she is. . . ."
But Hermione wasn't at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to
look for her afterward. The only person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron
hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in
whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph - but then Ron
realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating
exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.
"Wonder where she's got to?" Ron said as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor
Tower.
"Dunno . . . balderdash."
But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing
feet behind them announced Hermione's arrival.
"Harry!" she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady stared down at
her, eyebrows raised). "Harry, you've got to come - you've got to come, the
most amazing thing's happened- please -"
She seized Harry's arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor.
"What's the matter?" Harry said.
"I'll show you when we get there - oh come on, quick -"
Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued.
"Okay," Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron
hurrying to keep up.
"Oh don't mind me!" the Fat Lady called irritably after them. "Don't apologize
for bothering me! I'll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?"
"Yeah, thanks!" Ron shouted over his shoulder.
"Hermione, where are we going?" Harry asked, after she had led
them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the
entrance hall.
"You'll see, you'll see in a minute!" said Hermione excitedly.
She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door
through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had
regurgitated his and Harry's names. Harry had never been through here before.
He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of
ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape's
dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with
torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.
"Oh hang on . . ." said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. "Wait a
minute, Hermione. . . ."
"What?" She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face.
"I know what this is about," said Harry.
He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It showed a
gigantic silver fruit bowl.
"Hermione!" said Ron, cottoning on. "You're trying to rope us into that spew
stuff again!"
"No, no, I'm not!" she said hastily. "And it's not spew, Ron -"
"Changed the name, have you?" said Ron, frowning at her. "What are we now,
then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I'm not barging into that kitchen and
trying to make them stop work, I'm not doing it -"
"I'm not asking you to!" Hermione said impatiently. "I came down here just
now, to talk to them all, and I found - oh come on, Harry, I want to show you!"
She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit
bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear. It began to
squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle.
Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back,
forcing him inside.
He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room, large as the
Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped
around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when
something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing,
"Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!"
Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit
him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.
"D-Dobby?" Harry gasped.
"It is Dobby, sir, it is!" squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.
"Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter
has come to see him, sir!"
Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his
enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He
looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose, the
batlike ears, the long fingers and feet - all except the clothes, which were very
different.
When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy
old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of
garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing
himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a
hat, on which he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with
horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of what looked like children's soccer shorts,
and odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had removed
from his own foot and tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting
Dobby free. The other was covered in pink and orange stripes.
"Dobby, what're you doing here?" Harry said in amazement. "Dobby has come
to work at Hogwarts, sir!" Dobby squealed excitedly. "Professor Dumbledore
gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!
"Winky?" said Harry. "She's here too?"
"Yes, sir, yes!" said Dobby, and he seized Harry's hand and pulled him off into
the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of these
tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four
House tables above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food,
dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden
with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts
above.
At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming,
bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing
the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as
Winky's had been, like a toga.
Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed.
"Winky, sir!" he said.
Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not
foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a
matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears. However, while
every one of Dobby's strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared
for that it looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at
all. There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.
"Hello, Winky," said Harry.
Winky's lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great
brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the Quidditch
World Cup.
"Oh dear," said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the
end of the kitchen. "Winky, don't cry, please don't..."
But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at
Harry.
"Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?" he squeaked loudly, over Winky's sobs.
"Er - yeah, okay," said Harry.
Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large
silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk jug,
and a large plate of biscuits.
"Good service!" Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him,
but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated.
"How long have you been here, Dobby?" Harry asked as Dobby handed
around the tea.
"Only a week. Harry Potter, sir!" said Dobby happily. "Dobby came to see
Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who
has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed -"
At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a nose dribbling all
down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow.
"Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!"
Dobby squeaked. "But Dobby hasn't found work, sir, because Dobby wants
paying now!"
The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching
with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said
something rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, "Good for you,
Dobby!"
"Thank you, miss!" said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. "But most wizards
doesn't want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. 'That's not the point of a
house-elf,' they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby's face! Dobby likes
work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid. Harry Potter....
Dobby likes being free!"
The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though
he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she
was, though there was a definite increase in the volume other crying.
"And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky has
been freed too, sir!" said Dobby delightedly.
At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay face-down on the
flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with
misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to
comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference. Dobby
continued with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky's screeches.
"And then Dobby had the idea. Harry Potter, sir! 'Why doesn't Dobby and
Winky find work together?' Dobby says. 'Where is there enough work for two
house-elves?' says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir!
Hogwarts! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and
Professor Dumbledore took us on!"
Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again.
"And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants
paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and
one day off a month!"
"That's not very much!" Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over
Winky's continued screaming and fist-beating.
"Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,"
said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much
leisure and riches were frightening, "but Dobby beat him down, miss. . . .
Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn't wanting too much, miss, he likes work
better."
"And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?" Hermione
asked kindly.
If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly mistaken. Winky
did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her
massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.
"Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!" she squeaked.
"Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!"
"Ashamed?" said Hermione blankly. "But - Winky, come on! It's Mr. Crouch
who should be ashamed, not you! You didn't do anything wrong, he was really
horrible to you -"
But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat,
flattening her ears so that she couldn't hear a word, and screeched, "You is not
insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a
good wizard, miss! Mr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!"
"Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter," squeaked Dobby
confidentially. "Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is
allowed to speak her mind now, but she won't do it."
"Can't house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?" Harry asked.
"Oh no, sir, no," said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. "'Tis part of the houseelf's enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We upholds
the family's honor, and we never speaks ill of them - though Professor
Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore
said we is free to - to-"
Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent
forward. Dobby whispered, "He said we is free to call him a - a barmy old
codger if we likes, sir!"
Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.
"But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter," he said, talking normally again,
and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. "Dobby likes Professor
Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for
him."
"But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?" Harry asked him,
grinning.
A slightly fearful look came into Dobby's immense eyes.
"Dobby - Dobby could," he said doubtfully. He squared his small shoulders.
"Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were - were - bad Dark
wizards'."
Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his own daring
- then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very
hard, squealing, "Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!"
Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table.
"Thank you. Harry Potter, thank you," said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his
head.
"You just need a bit of practice," Harry said.
"Practice!" squealed Winky furiously. "You is ought to be ashamed of
yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!"
"They isn't my masters anymore, Winky!" said Dobby defiantly. "Dobby
doesn't care what they think anymore!"
"Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!" moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face
once more. "My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is
needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life,
and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her
... oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the
shame!" She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.
"Winky," said Hermione firmly, "I'm quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along
perfectly well without you. We've seen him, you know -"
"You is seeing my master?" said Winky breathlessly, raising her tearstained
face out of her skirt once more and goggling at Hermione. "You is seeing him
here at Hogwarts?"
"Yes," said Hermione, "he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard
Tournament."
"Mr. Bagman comes too?" squeaked Winky, and to Harry 's great surprise (and
Ron's and Hermione's too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.
"Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My master isn't liking him,
oh no, not at all!"
"Bagman - bad?" said Harry.
"Oh yes," Winky said, nodding her head furiously, "My master is telling Winky
some things! But Winky is not saying.. . Winky - Winky keeps her master's
secrets. ..."
She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt,
"Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more!”
They couldn't get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her
crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a
free elf and his plans for his wages.
"Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!" he said happily, pointing
at his bare chest,
"Tell you what, Dobby," said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to
the elf, "I'll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one
from her. You don't mind maroon, do you?”
Dobby was delighted.
"We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you," Ron told him, "but it'll go well
with your tea cozy."
As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in
upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a
pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron
loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.
"Thanks a lot!" Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to
say good night. "See you, Dobby!"
"Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?" Dobby asked
tentatively.
" 'Course you can," said Harry, and Dobby beamed.
"You know what?" said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the
kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. "All
these years I've been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from
the kitchens - well, it's not exactly difficult, is it? They can't wait to give it
away!"
"I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you
know," said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. "Dobby
coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being
free, and slowly it'll dawn on them that they want that too!"
"Let's hope they don't look too closely at Winky," said Harry.
"Oh she'll cheer up," said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful. "Once
the shock's worn off, and she's got used to Hogwarts, she'll see how much better
off she is without that Crouch man."
"She seems to love him," said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake).
"Doesn't think much of Bagman, though, does she?" said Harry. "Wonder
what Crouch says at home about him?"
"Probably says he's not a very good Head of Department," said Hermione, "and
let's face it... he's got a point, hasn't he?"
"I'd still rather work for him than old Crouch," said Ron. "At least Bagman's got
a sense of humor."
"Don't let Percy hear you saying that," Hermione said, smiling slightly.
"Yeah, well, Percy wouldn't want to work for anyone with a sense of humor,
would he?" said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair. "Percy wouldn't
recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby's tea cozy."
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO – THE UNEXPECTED TASK
Potter! Weasley! Will you pay attention?"
Professor McGonagall's irritated voice cracked like a whip through the
Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron both jumped and looked
up.
It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they
had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on
Professor McGonagall's desk (Neville's still had feathers); they had copied
down their homework from the blackboard ("Describe, with examples, the
ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing CrossSpecies The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and
Ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George's
fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin parrot and
Harry, a rubber haddock.
"Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age," said
Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of
Harry's haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor - Ron's parrot's beak had
severed it moments before - "I have something to say to you all.
"The Yule Ball is approaching - a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament
and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests. Now, the ball
will be open only to fourth years and above - although you may invite a
younger student if you wish -"
Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the
ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle. They both
looked around at Harry, Professor McGonagall ignored them, which Harry
thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and Ron.
"Dress robes will be worn," Professor McGonagall continued, "and the ball will
start at eight o'clock on Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great Hall.
Now then -"
Professor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class.
"The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to - er - let our hair down," she
said, in a disapproving voice.
Lavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard against her
mouth to stifle the sound. Harry could see what was funny this time: Professor
McGonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though she had never let her
hair down in any sense.
"But that does NOT mean," Professor McGonagall went on, "that we will be
relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students. I will be
most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any
way."
The bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed
their bags and swung them onto their shoulders.
Professor McGonagall called above the noise, "Potter - a word, if you please."
Assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock, Harry
proceeded gloomily to the teacher's desk. Professor McGonagall waited until
the rest of the class had gone, and then said, "Potter, the champions and their
partners -"
"What partners?" said Harry.
Profesor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she thought he was
trying to be funny.
"Your partners for the Yule Ball, Potter," she said coldly. "Your dance
partners."
Harry's insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.
"Dance partners?" He felt himself going red. "I don't dance," he said quickly.
"Oh yes, you do," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "That's what I'm telling
you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball."
Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails, accompanied
by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to Uncle Vernon's
work parties.
"I'm not dancing," he said.
"It is traditional," said Professor McGonagall firmly. "You are a Hogwarts
champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the
school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter."
"But-I don't-"
"You heard me, Potter," said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of way.
A week ago. Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a
cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done
the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought
he'd rather have another round with the dragon.
Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at
Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was
usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the
minority before now. This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and
above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with
the coming ball - or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many
girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before.
Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as
boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to
wear on Christmas night... .
"Why do they have to move in packs?" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls
walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. "How're you supposed to
get one on their own to ask them?"
"Lasso one?" Ron suggested. "Got any idea who you're going to try?"
Harry didn't answer. He knew perfectly well whom he'd like to ask, but working
up the nerve was something else. . . . Cho was a year older than he was; she was
very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch player, and she was also very
popular.
Ron seemed to know what was going on inside Harry's head.
"Listen, you're not going to have any trouble. You're a champion. You've just
beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they'll be queuing up to go with you."
In tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the bitterness in his
voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry's amazement, he turned out to be
quite right.
A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in
his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so
taken aback he said no before he'd even stopped to consider the matter. The girl
walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean's, Seamus's, and
Ron's taunts about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two
more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked
as though she might knock him out if he refused.
"She was quite good-looking," said Ron fairly, after he'd stopped laughing.
"She was a foot taller than me," said Harry, still unnerved. "Imagine what I'd
look like trying to dance with her."
Hermione's words about Krum kept coming back to him. "They only like him
because he's famous!" Harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had
asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he
hadn't been a school champion. Then he wondered if this would bother him if
Cho asked him.
On the whole. Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of
opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got
through the first task. He wasn't attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the
corridors anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric - he had an
idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude
for Harry's tip-off about the dragons. There seemed to be fewer Support Cedric
Diggory! badges around too. Draco Malfoy, of course, was still quoting Rita
Skeeter's article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer
and fewer laughs out of it - and just to heighten Harry's feeling of well-being, no
story about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet.
"She didn' seem very int'rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth,"
Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione asked him how his interview with
Rita Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the
term. To their very great relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the
skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at
a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the
skrewts.
"She jus' wanted me ter talk about you, Harry," Hagrid continued in a low
voice. "Well, I told her we'd been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the
Dursleys. 'Never had to tell him off in four years?' she said. 'Never played you
up in lessons, has he?' I told her no, an she didn' seem happy at all. Yeh'd think
she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry."
" 'Course she did," said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal
bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more. "She can't keep writing about
what a tragic little hero I am, it'll get boring."
"She wants a new angle, Hagrid," said Ron wisely as he shelled salamander
eggs. "You were supposed to say Harry's a mad delinquent!"
"But he's not!" said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked.
"She should've interviewed Snape," said Harry grimly. "He'd give her the goods
on me any day. 'Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at
this school. . . .'"
"Said that, did he?" said Hagrid, while Ron and Hermione laughed. "Well, yeh
might've bent a few rules. Harry, bu' yeh're all righ' really, aren' you?"
"Cheers, Hagrid," said Harry, grinning.
"You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?" said Ron.
"Though' I might look in on it, yeah," said Hagrid gruffly. "Should be a good
do, I reckon. You'll be openin the dancin', won yeh, Harry? Who're you
takin'?"
"No one, yet," said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn't pursue
the subject.
The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumors
about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though Harry didn't believe half of
them - for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of
mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had
booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry
didn't know, never having had access to a wizard's wireless, but he deduced
from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN
(Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group.
Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them
much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play
games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about
the perfect Summoning Charm
Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Other
teachers were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns, for
example, from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions - as Binns
hadn't let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a
small thing like Christmas wasn't going to put him off. It was amazing how he
could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percys
cauldron-bottom report. Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working
until the very last second of their classes too, and Snape, of course, would no
sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at
them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes
during the last lesson of the term.
"Evil, he is," Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room.
"Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole
load of studying."
"Mmm . . . you're not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?" said
Hermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy
building a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack - a much more interesting
pastime than with Muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing
would blow up at any second.
"It's Christmas, Hermione," said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with the
Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.
Hermione looked severely over at him too. "I'd have thought you'd be doing
something constructive, Harry, even if you don't want to learn your antidotes!"
"Like what?" Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a
Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.
"That egg!" Hermione hissed.
"Come on, Hermione, I've got till February the twenty-fourth," Harry said.
He had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn't opened it since the
celebration party after the first task. There were still two and a half months to
go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all.
"But it might take weeks to work it out!" said Hermione. "You're going to look
a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don't!"
"Leave him alone, Hermione, he's earned a bit of a break," said Ron, and he
placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing
his eyebrows.
"Nice look, Ron ... go well with your dress robes, that will."
It was Fred and George. They sat down at the table with Harry, Ron, and
Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done.
"Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?" George asked.
"No, he's off delivering a letter," said Ron. "Why?"
"Because George wants to invite him to the ball," said Fred sarcastically.
"Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat," said George.
"Who d'you two keep writing to, eh?" said Ron.
"Nose out, Ron, or I'll burn that for you too," said Fred, waving his wand
threateningly. "So . . . you lot got dates for the ball yet?"
"Nope," said Ron.
"Well, you'd better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone," said Fred.
"Who're you going with, then?" said Ron.
"Angelina," said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment.
"What?" said Ron, taken aback. "You've already asked her?"
"Good point," said Fred. He turned his head and called across the common
room, "Oi! Angelina!"
Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over
at him.
"What?" she called back.
"Want to come to the ball with me?"
Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.
"All right, then," she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting
with a bit of a grin on her face.
"There you go," said Fred to Harry and Ron, "piece of cake."
He got to his feet, yawning, and said, "We'd better use a school owl then,
George, come on. .. ."
They left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering
wreck of his card castle at Harry.
"We should get a move on, you know . . . ask someone. He's right. We don't
want to end up with a pair of trolls."
Hermione let out a sputter of indignation.
"A pair of... what, excuse me?"
"Well - you know," said Ron, shrugging. "I'd rather go alone than with - with
Eloise Midgen, say."
"Her acne's loads better lately - and she's really nice!"
"Her nose is off-center," said Ron.
"Oh I see," Hermione said, bristling. "So basically, you're going to take the
best-looking girl who'll have you, even if she's completely horrible?"
"Er - yeah, that sounds about right," said Ron.
"I'm going to bed," Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls'
staircase without another word.
The Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors
from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its
best this Christmas. When the decorations went up. Harry noticed that they
were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles
had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve
Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous
holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armor had all been
bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite something
to hear "0 Come, All Ye Faithful" sung by an empty helmet that only knew half
the words. Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside
the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with
lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude.
And still. Harry hadn't asked Cho to the ball. He and Ron were getting very
nervous now, though as Harry pointed out, Ron would look much less stupid
than he would without a partner;
Harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions.
"I suppose there's always Moaning Myrtle," he said gloomily, referring to the
ghost who haunted the girls' toilets on the second floor.
"Harry - we've just got to grit our teeth and do it," said Ron on Friday morning,
in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable
fortress. "When we get back to the common room tonight, we'll both have
partners - agreed?"
"Er . . . okay," said Harry.
But every time he glimpsed Cho that day - during break, and then lunchtime,
and once on the way to History of Magic - she was surrounded by friends.
Didn't she ever go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps ambush her as she was
going into a bathroom? But no - she even seemed to go there with an escort of
four or five girls. Yet if he didn't do it soon, she was bound to have been asked
by somebody else.
He found it hard to concentrate on Snape's Potions test, and consequently forgot
to add the key ingredient - a bezoar - meaning that he received bottom marks.
He didn't care, though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he
was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the
dungeon door.
"I'll meet you at dinner," he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off
upstairs.
He'd just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all. ... He hurried off
through the packed corridors looking for her, and (rather sooner than he had
expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.
"Er - Cho? Could I have a word with you?"
Giggling should be made illegal. Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around
Cho started doing it. She didn't, though. She said, "Okay," and followed him
out of earshot other classmates.
Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he
had missed a step going downstairs.
"Er," he said.
He couldn't ask her. He couldn't. But he had to. Cho stood there looking
puzzled, watching him. The words came out before Harry had quite got his
tongue around them.
"Wangoballwime?"
"Sorry?" said Cho.
"D'you - d'you want to go to the ball with me?" said Harry. Why did he have
to go red now? Why?
"Oh!" s aid Cho, and she went red too. "Oh Harry, I'm really sorry," and she
truly looked it. "I've already said I'll go with someone else."
"Oh," said Harry.
It was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but
suddenly he didn't seem to have any insides at all.
"Oh okay," he said, "no problem."
"I'm really sorry," she said again.
"That's okay," said Harry.
They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said, "Well-"
"Yeah," said Harry.
"Well, 'bye," said Cho, still very red. She walked away.
Harry called after her, before he could stop himself.
"Who're you going with?"
"Oh - Cedric," she said. "Cedric Diggory."
"Oh right," said Harry.
His insides had come back again. It felt as though they had been filled with
lead in their absence.
Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor
Tower, Cho's voice echoing in his ears with every step he took. "Cedric -
Cedric Diggory." He had been starting to quite like Cedric - prepared to
overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome,
and popular, and nearly everyone's favorite champion. Now he suddenly
realized that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn't have enough
brains to fill an eggcup.
"Fairy lights," he said dully to the Fat Lady - the password had been changed
the previous day.
"Yes, indeed, dear!" she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hair band as she
swung forward to admit him.
Entering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his surprise he saw
Ron sitting ashen-faced in a distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him, talking
to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.
"What's up, Ron?" said Harry, joining them.
Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.
"Why did I do it?" he said wildly. "I don't know what made me do it!
"What?" said Harry.
"He - er - just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him," said Ginny.
She looked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting Ron's
arm sympathetically.
"You what?' said Harry.
"I don't know what made me do it!" Ron gasped again. "What was I playing
at? There were people - all around - I've gone mad - everyone watching! I was
just walking past her in the entrance hall - she was standing there talking to
Diggory - and it sort of came over me - and I asked her!"
Ron moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept talking, though the words
were barely distinguishable.
"She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. Didn't even answer. And
then - I dunno - I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it."
"She's part veela," said Harry. "You were right - her grandmother was one. It
wasn't your fault, I bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old
charm for Diggory and got a blast of it - but she was wasting her time. He's
going with Cho Chang."
Ron looked up.
"I asked her to go with me just now," Harry said dully, "and she told me."
Ginny had suddenly stopped smiling.
"This is mad," said Ron. "We're the only ones left who haven't got anyone -
well, except Neville. Hey - guess who he asked? Hermione!"
"What?" said Harry, completely distracted by this startling news.
"Yeah, I know!" said Ron, some of the color coming back into his face as he
started to laugh. "He told me after Potions! Said she's always been really nice,
helping him out with work and stuff- but she told him she was already going
with someone. Ha! As if! She just didn't want to go with Neville ... I mean,
who would?"
"Don't!" said Ginny, annoyed. "Don't laugh -"
Just then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole.
"Why weren't you two at dinner?" she said, coming over to join them.
"Because - oh shut up laughing, you two - because they've both just been turned
down by girls they asked to the ball!" said Ginny.
That shut Harry and Ron up.
"Thanks a bunch, Ginny," said Ron sourly.
"All the good-looking ones taken, Ron?" said Hermione loftily. "Eloise
Midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I'm sure you'll find
someone somewhere who'll have you."
But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new
light.
"Hermione, Neville's right - you are a girl. . . ."
"Oh well spotted," she said acidly.
"Well - you can come with one of us!"
"No, I can't," snapped Hermione.
"Oh come on," he said impatiently, "we need partners, we're going to look really
stupid if we haven't got any, everyone else has . . ."
"I can't come with you," said Hermione, now blushing, "because I'm already
going with someone."
"No, you're not!" said Ron. "You just said that to get rid of Neville!"
"Oh did I?" said Hermione, and her eyes flashed dangerously. "Just because it's
taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn't mean no one else has spotted I'm a
girl!"
Ron stared at her. Then he grinned again.
"Okay, okay, we know you're a girl," he said. "That do? Will you come now?"
"I've already told you!" Hermione said very angrily. "I'm going with someone
else!"
And she stormed off toward the girls' dormitories again.
"She's lying," said Ron flatly, watching her go.
"She's not," said Ginny quietly.
"Who is it then?" said Ron sharply.
"I'm not telling you, it's her business," said Ginny.
"Right," said Ron, who looked extremely put out, "this is getting stupid. Ginny,
you can go with Harry, and I'll just -"
"I can't," said Ginny, and she went scarlet too. "I'm going with - with Neville.
He asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought. . . well. . . I'm not going to
be able to go otherwise, I'm not in fourth year." She looked extremely
miserable. "I think I'll go and have dinner," she said, and she got up and walked
off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.
Ron goggled at Harry.
"What's got into them?" he demanded.
But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole.
The time had come for drastic action.
"Wait here," he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and
said, "Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?"
Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers
crossed in the pocket of his robes.
"Yes, all right then," she said finally, blushing furiously.
"Thanks," said Harry, in relief. "Lavender - will you go with Ron?"
"She's going with Seamus," said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder
than ever.
Harry sighed.
"Can't you think of anyone who'd go with Ron?" he said, lowering his voice so
that Ron wouldn't hear.
"What about Hermione Granger?" said Parvati.
"She's going with someone else."
Parvati looked astonished.
"Ooooh - who?" she said keenly.
Harry shrugged. "No idea," he said. "So what about Ron?"
"Well. . ." said Parvati slowly, "I suppose my sister might. . . Padma, you know
... in Ravenclaw. I'll ask her if you like."
"Yeah, that would be great," said Harry. "Let me know, will you?"
And he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than
it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil's nose was dead center.
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE – THE YULE BALL
Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given
for the holidays. Harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the
week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with
everyone else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during
term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so
much rowdier than usual. Fred and George had had a great success with their
Canary Creams, and for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept
bursting into feather all over the place. Before long, however, all the
Gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme
caution, in case it had a Canary Cream concealed in the center, and George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now working on developing something
else. Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred
and George in future. He still hadn't forgotten Dudley and the Ton-Tongue
Toffee.
Snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now. The pale blue
Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the
iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid's cabin, while the Durmstrang ship's
portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white with frost. The house-elves
down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming
stews and savory puddings, and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find
anything to complain about.
"It is too 'eavy, all zis 'Ogwarts food," they heard her saying grumpily as they
left the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron skulking behind Harry, keen
not to be spotted by Fleur). "I will not fit into my dress robes!"
"Oooh there's a tragedy," Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the entrance
hall. "She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn't she?"
"Hermione - who are you going to the ball with?" said Ron.
He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by
asking it when she least expected it. However, Hermione merely frowned and
said, "I'm not telling you, you'll just make fun of me."
"You're joking, Weasley!" said Malfoy, behind them. "You're not telling me
someone's asked that to the ball? Not the long-molared Mudblood?"
;
Harry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione said loudly, waving to
somebody over Malfoys shoulder, "Hello, Professor Moody!"
Malfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking wildly around for Moody, but
he was still up at the staff table, finishing his stew.
"Twitchy little ferret, aren't you, Malfoy?" said Hermione scathingly, and she,
Harry, and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily.
"Hermione," said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, "your teeth
..."
"What about them?" she said.
"Well, they're different. . . I've just noticed. . . ."
"Of course they are - did you expect me to keep those fangs Malfoy gave me?"
"No, I mean, they're different to how they were before he put that hex on you. . .
. They're all... straight and - and normal-sized."
Hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry noticed it too: It was
a very different smile from the one he remembered.
"Well. . . when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she held up a
mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally
were," she said. "And I just. . . let her carry on a bit." She smiled even more
widely. "Mum and Dad won't be too pleased. I've been trying to persuade them
to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on with my braces.
You know, they're dentists, they just don't think teeth and magic should - look!
Pigwidgeons back!"
Ron's tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle-laden banisters, a
scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him were pointing and
laughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and said, "Oh look at the
weeny owl! Isn't he cute?"
Stupid little feathery git!" Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up
Pigwidgeon. "You bring letters to the addressee! You don't hang around
showing off!"
Pigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron's fist. The third-year
girls all looked very shocked.
"Clear off!" Ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding Pigwidgeon, who
hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air. "Here - take it,
Harry," Ron added in an undertone as the third-year girls scuttled away looking
scandalized. He pulled Sirius's reply off Pigwidgeons leg. Harry pocketed it,
and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.
Everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday
steam to observe what anyone else was up to. Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat
apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with
snow, and Harry read out:
Dear Harry,
Congratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever put your name in
that goblet shouldn't be feeling too happy right now! I was going to suggest
a Conjunctivitus Curse, as a dragon's eyes are its weakest point - "That's
what Krum did!" Hermione whispered - but your way was better, I'm
impressed.
Don't get complacent, though. Harry. You've only done one task; whoever
put you in for the tournament's got plenty more opportunity if they're trying
to hurt you. Keep your eyes open -particularly when the person we
discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble.
Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.
Sirius
"He sounds exactly like Moody," said Harry quietly, tucking the letter away
again inside his robes. "'Constant vigilance!' You'd think I walk around with
my eyes shut, banging off the walls. ..."
"But he's right, Harry," said Hermione, "you have still got two tasks to do. You
really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start working out what it
means. . . ."
"Hermione, he's got ages!" snapped Ron. "Want a game of chess, Harry?"
"Yeah, okay," said Harry. Then, spotting the look on Hermione's face, he said,
"Come on, how'm I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on? I
won't even be able to hear the egg over this lot."
"Oh I suppose not," she sighed, and she sat down to watch their chess match,
which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron's, involving a couple of
recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop.
Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what had caused
his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw something with
very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness, so close they
were almost nose to nose.
"Dobby!" Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out
of bed. "Don't do that!"
“Dobby is sorry, sir!" squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backward with his
long fingers over his mouth. "Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter
'Merry Christmas' and bring him a present, Sir! Harry Potter did say Dobby
could come and see him sometimes, sir!"
It's okay," said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart
rate returned to normal. "Just - just prod me or something in future, all right,
don't bend over me like that. .."
Harry pulled back the curtains around his four-poster, took his glasses from his
bedside table, and put them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean, and
Neville. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings,
heavy-eyed and tousle-haired.
"Someone attacking you, Harry?" Seamus asked sleepily.
"No, it's just Dobby," Harry muttered. "Go back to sleep."
"Nah . . . presents!" said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed.
Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well
get down to some present-opening too. Harry turned back to Dobby, who was
now standing nervously next to Harrys bed, still looking worried that he had
upset Harry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea
cozy.
"Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?" he squeaked tentatively.
"'Course you can," said Harry. "Er. . . I've got something for you too."
It was a lie; he hadn't bought anything for Dobby at all, but he quickly opened
his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks. They
were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle
Vernon. The reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using
them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the
Sneako-scope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, "Sorry, I forgot to wrap

But Dobby was utterly delighted.
"Socks are Dobby's favorite, favorite clothes, sir!" he said, ripping off his odd
ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon's. "I has seven now, sir. . . . But sir ..." he
said, his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to their highest extent, so
that they reached to the bottom of his shorts, "they has made a mistake in the
shop, Harry Potter, they is giving you two the same!"
"Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn't spot that?" said Ron, grinning over from
his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. "Tell you what,
Dobby - here you go - take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And
here's your sweater."
He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the handknitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent, Dobby looked quite overwhelmed.
"Sir is very kind!" he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing
deeply to Ron. "Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter's
greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit,
as noble, as selfless -"
"They're only socks," said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears,
though he looked rather pleased all the same. "Wow, Harry -" He had just
opened Harry's present, a Chudley Cannon hat. "Cool!" He jammed it onto his
head, where it clashed horribly with his hair.
Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be - socks.
"Dobby is making them himself, sir!" the elf said happily. "He is buying the
wool out of his wages, sir!"
The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right
sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.
"They're . . . they're really . . . well, thanks, Dobby," said Harry, and he pulled
them on, causing Dobby's eyes to leak with happiness again.
"Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the
kitchens!" said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good-bye
to Ron and the others as he passed.
Harry's other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby's odd socks -
with the obvious exception of the Dursleys', which consisted of a single tissue,
an all-time low - Harry supposed they too were remember ing the Ton-Tongue
Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain
and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with
attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of
sweets including all Harrys favorites: Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans,
Chocolate Frogs, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There
was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley's usual package, including a new sweater
(green, with a picture of a dragon on it - Harry supposed Charlie had told her all
about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies.
Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went
down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor
Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great
Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and
Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage's Wizarding Crackers.
They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched
except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons
students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch Harry and the
Weasleys' snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o'clock said she was
going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.
"What, you need three hours?" said Ron, looking at her incredulously and
paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by George,
hit him hard on the side of the head. "Who're you going with?" he yelled after
Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.
There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven
o'clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their
snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting
in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely
tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture.
"Lairy fights, that's the one!" she giggled when they gave the password, and she
swung forward to let them inside.
Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in
their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as
Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled
look on his face. There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked
more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look
more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly
well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn't done a very neat job, and
the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.
"I still can't work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,"
muttered Dean.
"Animal magnetism," said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs.
The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors
instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of
the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her
long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists.
Harry was relieved to see that she wasn't giggling.
"You - er - look nice," he said awkwardly.
"Thanks," she said. "Padma's going to meet you in the entrance hall," she added
to Ron.
"Right," said Ron, looking around. "Where's Hermione?"
Parvati shrugged. "Shall we go down then, Harry?"
"Okay," said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred
winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.
The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for
eight o'clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those
people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging through
the crowd trying to find one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led
her over to Harry and Ron.
"Hi," said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright
turquoise. She didn't look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner,
though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes
as she looked him up and down.
"Hi," said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd. "Oh no ..."
He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur Delacour was
passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and accompanied by the
Ravenclaw Quidditch captain, Roger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron
stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.
"Where is Hermione?" he said again.
A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room.
Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high
collar, which in Harry's opinion made him look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson
in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy's arm. Crabbe and Goyle
were both wearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither of
them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner.
The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang
students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the party,
accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn't know. Over their heads
he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into
a sort of grotto full of fairy lights - meaning hundreds of actual living fairies
were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over
the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.
Then Professor McGonagall's voice called, "Champions over here, please!"
Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said, "See you in a
minute" to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to
let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red
tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other
hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside;
they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had
sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the
doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a
partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to
Harry too; he looked away from them so he wouldn't have to talk to them. His
eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.
It was Hermione.
But she didn't look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair;
it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot
at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkleblue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow - or maybe it
was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her
back. She was also smiling - rather nervously, it was true - but the reduction in
the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever; Harry couldn't
understand how he hadn't spotted it before.
"Hi, Harry!" she said. "Hi, Parvati!"
Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn't the only
one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum's fan club from the
library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy
Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn't seem
to be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron, however, walked right past
Hermione without looking at her.
Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told the
champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her. They did
so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started
walking up toward a large round table at the top of the Hall, where the judges
were sitting.
The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with
hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The
House tables had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred smaller,
lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people.
Harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed to be enjoying
herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so forcefully that
he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces. He
caught sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top table. Ron was watching
Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was looking sulky.
Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but
Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron's as he watched Krum and
Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman, tonight in robes of bright purple with
large yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students; and
Madame Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a
flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them politely. But Mr. Crouch,
Harry suddenly realized, was not there. The fifth seat at the table was occupied
by Percy Weasley.
When the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out the
empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint and sat
down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress robes and an
expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined.
"I've been promoted," Percy said before Harry could even ask, and from his
tone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the
universe. "I'm now Mr. Crouch's personal assistant, and I'm here representing
him."
"Why didn't he come?" Harry asked. He wasn't looking forward to being
lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.
"I'm afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn't well, not well at all. Hasn't been right since
the World Cup. Hardly surprising - overwork. He's not as young as he was -
though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was.
But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr. Crouch
suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house-elf of his,
Blinky, or whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her immediately
afterward, but - well, as I say, he's getting on, he needs looking after, and I think
he's found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left. And then we had
the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with - that
revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around - no, poor man, he's having a well
earned, quiet Christmas. I'm just glad he knew he had someone he could rely
upon to take his place."
Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling Percy
"Weatherby" yet, but resisted the temptation.
There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus were
lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainly and looked
around - there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked carefully down
at his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate, "Pork chops!"
And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their
orders with their plates too. Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt
about this new and more complicated method of dining - surely it meant plenty
of extra work for the house-elves? - but for once, Hermione didn't seem to be
thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with Viktor Krum and hardly
seemed to notice what she was eating.
It now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum speak before,
but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.
"Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am
thinking," he was telling Hermione. "Ve have just four floors, and the fires are
lit only for magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even than these -
though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But
in summer ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the mountains -"
"Now, now, Viktor!" said Karkaroff with a laugh that didn't reach his cold
eyes, "don't go giving away anything else, now, or your charming friend will
know exactly where to find us!"
Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. "Igor, all this secrecy ., . one would
almost think you didn't want visitors."
"Well, Dumbledore," said Karkaroff, displaying his yellowing teeth to their
fullest extent, "we are all protective of our private domains, are we not? Do we
not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us? Are we
not right to be proud that we alone know our school's secrets, and right to
protect them?"
"Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts' secrets, Igor," said
Dumbledore amicably. "Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong
turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully
proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather
magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more
closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out
for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only
appear at the quarter moon - or when the seeker has an exceptionally full
bladder."
Harry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry could have
sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.
Meanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to Roger
Davies.
"Zis is nothing," she said dismissively, looking around at the sparkling walls of
the Great Hall. "At ze Palace of Beauxbatons, we 'ave ice sculptures all around
ze dining chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not melt, of course . . . zey are like
'uge statues of diamond, glittering around ze place. And ze food is seemply
superb. And we 'ave choirs of wood nymphs, 'oo serenade us as we eat. We
'ave none of zis ugly armor in ze 'alls, and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into
Beauxbatons, 'e would be expelled like zat." She slapped her hand onto the
table impatiently.
Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face, and he
kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the impression that Davies was
too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying.
"Absolutely right," he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on the table in
imitation of Fleur. "Like that. Yeah."
Harry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff
tables; he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top
table. Harry saw him give a small wave, and looking around, saw Madame
Maxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight.
Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her
"Hermy-own."
"Her-my-oh-nee," she said slowly and clearly.
"Herm-own-ninny."
"Close enough," she said, catching Harry's eye and grinning.
When all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood up and asked the
students to do the same. Then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed
back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised
platform into existence along the right wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a
lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it.
The "Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic
applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been
artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had
been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was
coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out,
and that the other champions and their partners were standing up.
"Come on!" Parvati hissed. "We're supposed to dance!"
Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck up
a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully
avoiding catching anyone's eye (he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him
and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one
around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.
It wasn't as bad as it could have been. Harry thought, revolving slowly on the
spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the
watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance
floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention. Neville and
Ginny were dancing nearby - he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville
trod on her feet - and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He
was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin;
however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody
was doing an extremely ungainly two-step with Professor Sinistra, who was
nervously avoiding his wooden leg.
"Nice socks. Potter," Moody growled as he passed, his magical eye staring
through Harry's robes.
"Oh - yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me," said Harry, grinning.
"He is so creepy!” Parvati whispered as Moody clunked away. "I don't think
that eye should be allowed."
Harry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief. The Weird
Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of
Parvati at once.
"Let's sit down, shall we?"
"Oh - but - this is a really good one!" Parvati said as the Weird Sisters struck
up a new song, which was much faster.
"No, I don't like it," Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past
Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them
were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and
Padma were sitting.
"How's it going?" Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of
butterbeer.
Ron didn't answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were dancing
nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in
time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron,
who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry's other side,
crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy
from Beauxbatons.
"You don't mind, do you, Harry?" Parvati said.
"What?" said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.
"Oh never mind," snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from
Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.
Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati's empty chair. She was a bit pink
in the face from dancing.
"Hi," said Harry. Ron didn't say anything.
"It's hot, isn't it?" said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand. "Viktors just
gone to get some drinks."
Ron gave her a withering look. "Viktor?" he said. "Hasn't he asked you to call
him Vicky yet?"
Hermione looked at him in surprise. "What's up with you?" she said.
"If you don't know," said Ron scathingly, "I'm not going to tell you.”
Hermione stared at him, then at Harry, who shrugged.
"Ron, what - ?"
"He's from Durmstrang!" spat Ron. "He's competing against Harry! Against
Hogwarts! You - you're -" Ron was obviously casting around for words strong
enough to describe Hermione's crime, "fraternizing with the enemy, that's what
you're doing!"
Hermione's mouth fell open.
"Don't be so stupid!" she said after a moment. "The enemy! Honestly - who
was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive? Who was the one
who wanted his autograph? Who's got a model of him up in their dormitory?"
Ron chose to ignore this. "I s'pose he asked you to come with him while you
were both in the library?"
"Yes, he did," said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more
brightly. "So what?"
"What happened - trying to get him to join spew, were you?"
"No, I wasn't! If you really want to know, he - he said he'd been coming up to
the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn't been able to pluck up
the courage!"
Hermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she was the same
color as Parvati's robes.
"Yeah, well - that's his story," said Ron nastily.
"And what's that supposed to mean?"
"Obvious, isn't it? He's Karkaroff's student, isn't he? He knows who you hang
around with. . . . He's just trying to get closer to Harry - get inside information
on him - or get near enough to jinx him -"
Hermione looked as though Ron had slapped her. When she spoke, her voice
quivered.
"For your information, he hasn't asked me one single thing about Harry, not
one -"
Ron changed tack at the speed of light.
"Then he's hoping you'll help him find out what his egg means! I suppose you've
been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions -"
"I'd never help him work out that egg!" said Hermione, looking outraged.
"Never. How could you say something like that - I want Harry to win the
tournament. Harry knows that, don't you, Harry?"
"You've got a funny way of showing it," sneered Ron.
"This whole tournament's supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards
and making friends with them!" said Hermione hotly.
"No it isn't!" shouted Ron. "It's about winning!"
People were starting to stare at them.
"Ron," said Harry quietly, "I haven't got a problem with Hermione coming with
Krum -"
But Ron ignored Harry too.
"Why don't you go and find Vicky, he'll be wondering where you are," said
Ron.
"Don't call him Vicky!"
Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor,
disappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and
satisfaction on his face.
"Are you going to ask me to dance at all?" Padma asked him.
"No," said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.
"Fine," snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and the
Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that
Harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a Summoning Charm.
"Vare is Herm-own-ninny?" said a voice.
Krum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers.
"No idea," said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. "Lost her, have you?"
Krum was looking surly again.
"Veil, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks," he said, and he slouched off.
"Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?"
Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely
pompous. "Excellent! That's the whole point, you know - international magical
cooperation!"
To Harry's displeasure, Percy now took Padma's vacated seat. The top table
was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout,
Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were
cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students,
and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody
applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor
McGonagall's hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point
Fred and George accosted him.
"What do they think they're doing, annoying senior Ministry members?" Percy
hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. "No respect..."
Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting
Harry, waved and came over to their table.
"I hope my brothers weren't bothering you, Mr. Bagman?" said Percy at once.
"What? Oh not at all, not at all!" said Bagman. "No, they were just telling me a
bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on
the marketing. I've promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of
mine at Zonko's Joke Shop. ..."
Percy didn't look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet he
would be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got home.
Apparently Fred and George's plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if
they were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry
something, but Percy diverted him.
"How do you feel the tournament's going, Mr. Bagman? Our department's
quite satisfied - the hitch with the Goblet of Fire" - he glanced at Harry - "was a
little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don't
you think?"
"Oh yes," Bagman said cheerfully, "it's all been enormous fun. How's old Barty
doing? Shame he couldn't come."
"Oh I'm sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time," said Percy
importantly, "but in the meantime, I'm more than willing to take up the slack.
Of course, it's not all attending balls" - he laughed airily - "oh no, I've had to
deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence - you heard Ali
Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country?
And then we've been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the
International Ban on Dueling. I've got a meeting with their Head of Magical
Cooperation in the new year -"
"Let's go for a walk," Ron muttered to Harry, "get away from Percy. ..."
Pretending they wanted more drinks. Harry and Ron left the table, edged
around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall. The front doors
stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and
twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves
surrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues.
Harry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain. Here and
there, people were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off along one of
the winding paths through the rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way
when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.
"... don't see what there is to fuss about, Igor."
"Severus, you cannot pretend this isn't happening!" Karkaroffs voice sounded
anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. "It's been getting
clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously concerned, I can't deny
it
"Then flee," said Snapes voice curtly. "Flee - I will make your excuses. I,
however, am remaining at Hogwarts."
Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out and was
blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued from
many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.
"Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!" Snape snarled as a girl ran past him.
"And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!" as a boy went rushing after
her. "And what are you two doing?" he added, catching sight of Harry and Ron
on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see
them standing there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began
winding it around his finger.
"We re walking," Ron told Snape shortly. "Not against the law, is it?"
"Keep walking, then!" Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black
cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry
and Ron continued down the path.
"What's got Karkaroff all worried?" Ron muttered.
"And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?"said Harry
slowly.
They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the
sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous people
were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. And then
Harry heard Hagrid speak.
"Momen' I saw yeh, I knew," he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.
Harry and Ron froze. This didn't sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk
in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur
Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby. He
tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they
could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked
very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur,
shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the
reindeer.
"What did you know, 'Agrid?" said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low voice.
Harry definitely didn't want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be
overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) - if it had been
possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that
wasn't really an option. Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling
along the stone reindeer's back, but the beetle just wasn't interesting enough to
block out Hagrid's next words.
"I jus' knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother or yer father?"
"I - I don't know what you mean, 'Agrid. ..."
"It was my mother," said Hagrid quietly. "She was one o' the las' ones in
Britain. 'Course, I can' remember her too well. . . she left, see. When I was
abou' three. She wasn' really the maternal sort. Well. . . it's not in their natures,
is it? Dunno what happened to her . . . might be dead fer all I know. ..."
Madame Maxime didn't say anything. And Harry, in spite of himself, took his
eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer's antlers, listening. ...
He had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before.
"Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen'. Tiny little bloke, my dad was. By
the time I was six I could lift him up an' put him on top o' the dresser if he
annoyed me. Used ter make him laugh. . . ." Hagrid's deep voice broke.
Madame Maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring at the silvery
fountain. "Dad raised me . . . but he died, o' course, jus' after I started school.
Sorta had ter make me own way after that. Dumbledore was a real help, mind.
Very kind ter me, he was. . . ."
Hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily.
"So ... anyway . . . enough abou' me. What about you? Which side you got it
on?"
But Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.
"It is chilly," she said - but whatever the weather was doing, it was nowhere
near as cold as her voice. "I think I will go in now."
"Eh?" said Hagrid blankly. "No, don go! I've - I've never met another one
before!"
"Anuzzer what, precisely?" said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.
Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in the
shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn't - but it was no good.
"Another half-giant, o' course!" said Hagrid.
"'Ow dare you!" shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through the
peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him. Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall
out of their rosebush. "I 'ave nevair been more insulted in my life! 'Alf-giant?
Moi? I 'ave - I 'ave big bones!"
She stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she
passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the bench,
staring after her. It was much too dark to make out his expression. Then, after
about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off out
into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.
"C'mon," Harry said, very quietly to Ron. "Let's go. . . ."
But Ron didn't move.
"What's up?" said Harry, looking at him.
Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.
"Did you know?" he whispered. "About Hagrid being half-giant?"
"No," Harry said, shrugging. "So what?"
He knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that he was once
again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world. Brought up by the
Dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that were
revelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer with each successive
year. Now, however, he could tell that most wizards would not have said "So
what?" upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother.
"I'll explain inside," said Ron quietly, "c'mon. . .."
Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of
bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and Padma were
now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of Beauxbatons boys, and
Hermione was once more dancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat down at a
table far removed from the dance floor.
"So?" Harry prompted Ron. "What's the problem with giants?"
"Well, they're . . . they're . . ." Ron struggled for words. ". . . not very nice," he
finished lamely.
"Who cares?" Harry said. "There's nothing wrong with Hagrid!"
"I know there isn't, but. . . blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet," Ron said,
shaking his head. "I always thought he'd got in the way of a bad Engorgement
Charm when he was a kid or something. Didn't like to mention it. ..."
"But what's it matter if his mother was a giantess?" said Harry.
"Well... no one who knows him will care, 'cos they'll know he's not dangerous,"
said Ron slowly. "But. . . Harry, they're just vicious, giants. It's like Hagrid
said, it's in their natures, they're like trolls . . . they just like killing, everyone
knows that. There aren't any left in Britain now, though."
"What happened to them?"
"Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed by
Aurors. There're supposed to be giants abroad, though. . . . They hide out in
mountains mostly. . . ."
"I don't know who Maxime thinks she's kidding," Harry said, watching
Madame Maxime sitting alone at the judges' table, looking very somber. "If
Hagrid's half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones . .. the only thing that's got
bigger bones than her is a dinosaur."
Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner, neither
of them having any inclination to dance. Harry tried not to watch Cho and
Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to kick something.
When the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave them a last,
loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall.
Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer,
but Harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as far as he was concerned,
the evening hadn't been much fun.
Out in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good night to
Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very cold
look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking. Harry and
Ron followed her, but halfway up the staircase Harry heard someone calling
him.
"Hey-Harry!"
It was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the entrance
hall below.
"Yeah?" said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him.
Cedric looked as though he didn't want to say whatever it was in front of Ron,
who shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the stairs.
"Listen ..." Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared. "I owe you one for
telling me about the dragons. You know that golden egg? Does yours wail
when you open it?"
"Yeah," said Harry.
"Well... take a bath, okay?"
"What?"
"Take a bath, and - er - take the egg with you, and - er - just mull things over in
the hot water. It'll help you think. . . . Trust me."
Harry stared at him.
"Tell you what," Cedric said, "use the prefects' bathroom. Fourth door to the
left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password's 'pine
fresh.' Gotta go ... want to say good night -"
He grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to Cho.
Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That had been extremely
strange advice. Why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg
meant? Was Cedric pulling his leg? Was he trying to make Harry look like a
fool, so Cho would like him even more by comparison?
The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait
hole. Harry had to yell "Fairy lights!" before he woke them up, and when he
did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common room and
found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they
were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.
"Well, if you don't like it, you know what the solution is, don't you?" yelled
Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face
was screwed up in anger.
"Oh yeah?" Ron yelled back. "What's that?"
"Next time there's a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last
resort!"
Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned on
her heel and stormed up the girls' staircase to bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.
"Well," he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, "well - that just proves -
completely missed the point -"
Harry didn't say anything. He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too
much to speak his mind right now - but he somehow thought that Hermione had
gotten the point much better than Ron had.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR – RITA SKEETER’S SCOOP
Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was
much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy
conversations. Hermione's hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that
she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy's Hair Potion on it for the ball, "but
it's way too much bother to do every day," she said matter-of-factly, scratching a
purring Crookshanks behind the ears.
Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to
discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though
oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the
conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but
Hermione didn't seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as
shocking as Ron did.
"Well, I thought he must be," she said, shrugging. "I knew he couldn't be pure
giant because they're about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about
giants. They can't all be horrible. . . . It's the same sort of prejudice that people
have toward werewolves. . . . It's just bigotry, isn't it?"
Ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he
didn't want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head
disbelievingly while Hermione wasn't looking.
It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first
week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that
Christmas was over - everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once
again) to feel slightly nervous.
The trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer from this
side of Christmas, and he still hadn't done anything about working out the clue
inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every
time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that
this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the sound
reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard
anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again
to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn't. He tried asking the egg questions,
shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the egg
across the room - though he hadn't really expected that to help.
Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-thanfriendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his
help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed to him that if Cedric had really
wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He,
Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task - and Cedric's
idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn't
need that sort of rubbishy help - not from someone who kept walking down
corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term
arrived, and Harry set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and
quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach,
as though he were carrying that around with him too.
Snow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were
covered in condensation so thick that they couldn't see out of them in
Herbology. Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much
in this weather, though as Ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up
nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that Hagrid's cabin
would catch fire.
When they arrived at Hagrid 's cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with
closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front
door.
"Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago," she barked at them as they
struggled toward her through the snow.
"Who're you?" said Ron, staring at her. "Wheres Hagrid?"
"My name is Professor Grubbly-Plank," she said briskly. "I am your temporary
Care of Magical Creatures teacher."
"Where's Hagrid?" Harry repeated loudly.
"He is indisposed," said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly.
Soft and unpleasant laughter reached Harrys ears. He turned; Draco Malfoy and
the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class. All of them looked gleeful, and
none of them looked surprised to see Professor Grubbly-Plank.
"This way, please," said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode off around the
paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione followed her, looking back over their shoulders at Hagrid's cabin.
All the curtains were closed. Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?
"What's wrong with Hagrid?" Harry said, hurrying to catch up with Professor
Grubbly-Plank.
"Never you mind," she said as though she thought he was being nosy.
"I do mind, though," said Harry hotly. "What's up with him?"
Professor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn't hear him. She led them
past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled
against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and
beautiful unicorn was tethered.
Many of the girls "ooooohed!" at the sight of the unicorn.
"Oh it's so beautiful!" whispered Lavender Brown. "How did she get it?
They're supposed to be really hard to catch!"
The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray. It
was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its
horned head.
"Boys keep back!" barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, throwing out an arm and
catching Harry hard in the chest. "They prefer the woman's touch, unicorns.
Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does it. ..."
She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the boys
standing near the paddock fence, watching. The moment Professor GrubblyPlank was out of earshot. Harry turned to Ron.
"What d'you reckons wrong with him? You don't think a skrewt - ?"
"Oh he hasn't been attacked, Potter, if that's what you're thinking," said Malfoy
softly. "No, he's just too ashamed to show his big, ugly face."
"What d'you mean?" said Harry sharply.
Malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page
of newsprint.
"There you go," he said. "Hate to break it to you. Potter. ..."
He smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE'S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments,
writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. In September of this year, he
hired Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach
Defense Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at
the Ministry of Magic, given Moody's well-known habit of attacking anybody
who makes a sudden movement in his presence. Mad-Eye Moody, however,
looks responsible and kindly when set beside the part-human Dumbledore
employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year,
has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured
for him by Dumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious
influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical
Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better-qualified candidates.
An alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has been using his
newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of
horrific creatures. While Dumbledore turns a blind eye, Hagrid has maimed
several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being "very
frightening."
'I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off
a flobberworm," says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student. "We all hate Hagrid,
but we're just too scared to say anything."
Hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however. In
conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding
creatures he has dubbed "Blast-Ended Skrewts," highly dangerous crosses
between manti-cores and fire-crabs. The creation of new breeds of magical
creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the Department
for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Hagrid, however,
considers himself to be above such petty restrictions.
"I was just having some fun," he says, before hastily changing the subject.
As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that
Hagrid is not - as he has always pretended - a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in
fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other
than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.
Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction
by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that
remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were
responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror.
While many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were
killed by Aurors working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among
them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in
foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons
are any guide, however, Frid-wulfa's son appears to have inherited her brutal
nature.
In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with
the boy who brought around You-Know-Who's fall from power - thereby
driving Hagrid's own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who's supporters, into
hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large
friend - but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter,
along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with
part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.
"How did she find out?" he whispered.
But that wasn't what was bothering Harry.
"What d'you mean, 'we all hate Hagrid'?" Harry spat at Malfoy. "What's this
rubbish about him" - he pointed at Crabbe - "getting a bad bite off a
flobberworm? They haven't even got teeth!"
Crabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.
"Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf's teaching career," said Malfoy,
his eyes glinting. "Half-giant. . . and there was me thinking he'd just swallowed
a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. ... None of the mummies and daddies
are going to like this at all. ... They'll be worried he'll eat their kids, ha, ha. ..."
“You-“
"Are you paying attention over there?"
Professor Grubbly-Planks voice carried over to the boys; the girls were all
clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the
Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the
unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now
enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.
"I hope she stays, that woman!" said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended
and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch. "That's more what I
thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like . . . proper creatures like
unicorns, not monsters. . . ."
"What about Hagrid?" Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.
"What about him?" said Parvati in a hard voice. "He can still be gamekeeper,
can't he?"
Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he
ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good
time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she
had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on
the next weekend trip.
"That was a really good lesson," said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall.
"I didn't know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni -"
"Look at this!" Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under
Hermione's nose.
Hermione's mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same as
Ron's.
"How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don't think Hagrid told
her?"
"No," said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing
himself into a chair, furious. "He never even told us, did he? I reckon she was
so mad he wouldn't give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting
around to get him back."
"Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball," said Hermione
quietly.
"We'd have seen her in the garden!" said Ron. "Anyway, she's not supposed to
come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. . . ."
"Maybe she's got an Invisibility Cloak," said Harry, ladling chicken casserole
onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. "Sort of thing she'd do,
isn't it, hide in bushes listening to people."
"Like you and Ron did, you mean," said Hermione.
"We weren't trying to hear him!" said Ron indignantly. "We didn't have any
choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could
have heard him!"
"We've got to go and see him," said Harry. "This evening, after Divination. Tell
him we want him back . . . you do want him back?" he shot at Hermione.
"I - well, I'm not going to pretend it didn't make a nice change, having a proper
Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once - but I do want Hagrid back, of
course I do!" Hermione added hastily, quailing under Harry's furious stare.
So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more and went
down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid's cabin. They knocked, and Fang's
booming barks answered.
"Hagrid, it's us!" Harry shouted, pounding on the door. "Open up!"
Hagrid didn't answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the door, whining,
but it didn't open. They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even went
and banged on one of the windows, but there was no response.
"What's he avoiding us for?" Hermione said when they had finally given up
and were walking back to the school. "He surely doesn't think we'd care about
him being half-giant?"
But it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn't see a sign of him all week. He
didn't appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn't see him going about his
gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to
take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every
possible opportunity.
"Missing your half-breed pal?" he kept whispering to Harry whenever there was
a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry's retaliation. "Missing the
elephant-man?"
There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very
surprised that Harry was going to go.
"I just thought you'd want to take advantage of the common room being quiet,"
she said. "Really get to work on that egg."
"Oh I - I reckon I've got a pretty good idea what it's about now," Harry lied.
"Have you really?" said Hermione, looking impressed. "Well done!"
Harrys insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five
weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages. . . whereas if he
went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade
him to come back.
He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off through
the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang ship
moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in
nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot
tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship,
stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake.
"He's mad!" said Harry, staring at Krums dark head as it bobbed out into the
middle of the lake. "It must be freezing, it's January!"
"It's a lot colder where he comes from," said Hermione. "I suppose it feels quite
warm to him."
"Yeah, but there's still the giant squid," said Ron. He didn't sound anxious - if
anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned.
"He's really nice, you know," she said. "He's not at all like you'd think, coming
from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he told me."
Ron said nothing. He hadn't mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but Harry
had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked
very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing
Bulgarian Quidditch robes.
Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy
High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had
ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.
The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables
told Harry that Hagrid wasn't there. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with
Ron and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and
thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to
the egg wailing after all.
"Doesn't he ever go into the office?" Hermione whispered suddenly. "Look!"
She pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman
reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins. Bagman
was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms
crossed and were looking rather menacing.
It was indeed odd. Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three
Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and therefore no
judging to be done. He watched Bagman in the mirror. He was looking
strained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the
Dark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, saw
Harry, and stood up.
"In a moment, in a moment!" Harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins,
and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry, his boyish grin back in
place.
"Harry!" he said. "How are you? Been hoping to run into you! Everything
going all right?"
"Fine, thanks," said Harry.
"Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?" said Bagman eagerly.
"You couldn't give us a moment, you two, could you?"
"Er - okay," said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table.
Bagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam Rosmerta.
"Well, I just thought I'd congratulate you again on your splendid performance
against that Horntail, Harry," said Bagman. "Really superb."
"Thanks," said Harry, but he knew this couldn't be all that Bagman wanted to
say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione.
Bagman didn't seem in any particular rush to spill the beans, though. Harry saw
him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching
him and Harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.
"Absolute nightmare," said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing Harry
watching the goblins too. "Their English isn't too good . . . it's like being back
with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup . . . but at least they used
sign language another human could recognize. This lot keep gabbling in
Gobblede-gook . . . and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It
means 'pickax.' I don't like to use it in case they think I'm threatening them."
He gave a short, booming laugh.
"What do they want?" Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still watching
Bagman very closely.
"Er - well. . ." said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous. "They ... er ... they're
looking for Barty Crouch."
"Why are they looking for him here?" said Harry. "He's at the Ministry in
London, isn't he?"
"Er ... as a matter of fact, I've no idea where he is," said Bagman. "He's sort
of... stopped coming to work. Been absent for a couple of weeks now. Young
Percy, his assistant, says he's ill. Apparently he's just been sending instructions
in by owl. But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone. Harry?
Because Rita Skeeter's still poking around everywhere she can, and I'm willing
to bet she'd work up Bartys illness into something sinister. Probably say he's
gone missing like Bertha Jorkins."
"Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?" Harry asked.
"No," said Bagman, looking strained again. "I've got people looking, of course
..." (About time, thought Harry) "and it's all very strange. She definitely
arrived in Albania, because she met her second cousin there. And then she left
the cousin's house to go south and see an aunt. . . and she seems to have
vanished without trace en route. Blowed if I can see where she's got to ... she
doesn't seem the type to elope, for instance . . . but still. . . . What are we doing,
talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to ask you" - he
lowered his voice - "how are you getting on with your golden egg?"
"Er . . . not bad," Harry said untruthfully.
Bagman seemed to know he wasn't being honest.
"Listen, Harry," he said (still in a very low voice), "I feel very bad about all this
. . . you were thrown into this tournament, you didn't volunteer for it... and if. .
." (his voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean closer to listen) "if I can help
at all... a prod in the right direction . . . I've taken a liking to you . . . the way
you got past that dragon! . . . well, just say the word."
Harry stared up into Bagman's round, rosy face and his wide, baby-blue eyes.
"We're supposed to work out the clues alone, aren't we?" he said, careful to
keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the
Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules.
"Well. . . well, yes," said Bagman impatiently, "but - come on. Harry - we all
want a Hogwarts victory, don't we?"
"Have you offered Cedric help?" Harry said.
The smallest of frowns creased Bagman's smooth face. "No, I haven't," he said.
"I - well, like I say, I've taken a liking to you. Just thought I'd offer ..."
"Well, thanks," said Harry, "but I think I'm nearly there with the egg . . . couple
more days should crack it."
He wasn't entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman's help, except that
Bagman was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would feel
somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron, Hermione, or
Sirius.
Bagman looked almost affronted, but couldn't say much more as Fred and
George turned up at that point.
"Hello, Mr. Bagman," said Fred brightly. "Can we buy you a drink?"
"Er . . . no," said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, "no, thank
you, boys ..."
Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying
Harry as though he had let him down badly.
"Well, I must dash," he said. "Nice seeing you all. Good luck, Harry.”
He hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after
him. Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.
"What did he want?" Ron said, the moment Harry had sat down.
"He offered to help me with the golden egg," said Harry.
"He shouldn't be doing that!" said Hermione, looking very shocked. "He's one
of the judges! And anyway, you've already worked it out - haven't you?"
"Er . . . nearly," said Harry.
"Well, I don't think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to
persuade you to cheat!" said Hermione, still looking deeply disapproving. "I
hope he's trying to help Cedric as much!"
"He's not, I asked," said Harry.
"Who cares if Diggorys getting help?" said Ron. Harry privately agreed.
"Those goblins didn't look very friendly," said Hermione, sipping her
butterbeer. "What were they doing here?"
"Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman," said Harry. "He's still ill. Hasn't
been into work."
"Maybe Percys poisoning him," said Ron. "Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it
he'll be made head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation."
Hermione gave Ron a don't-joke-about-things-like-that look, and said, "Funny,
goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They'd normally deal with the Department
for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures."
"Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though," said Harry. "Maybe
they need an interpreter."
"Worrying about poor 'ickle goblins, now, are you?" Ron asked Hermione.
"Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of
Ugly Goblins?"
"Ha, ha, ha," said Hermione sarcastically. "Goblins don't need protection.
Haven't you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about
goblin rebellions?"
"No," said Harry and Ron together.
"Well, quite capable of dealing with wizards," said Hermione, taking
another sip of butterbeer. "They're very clever. They're not like house-elves,
who never stick up for themselves."
"Uh-oh," said Ron, staring at the door.
Rita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing banana-yellow robes today; her
long nails were painted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by her
paunchy photographer. She bought drinks, and she and the photographer made
their way through the crowds to a table nearby. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
glaring at her as she approached. She was talking fast and looking very
satisfied about something.
"... didn't seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo? Now, why would that be,
do you think? And what's he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway?
Showing them the sights . .. what nonsense ... he was always a bad liar. Reckon
something's up? Think we should do a bit of digging? 'Disgraced Ex-Head of
Magical Games and Sports, Ludo Bagman . . .' Snappy start to a sentence, Bozo
- we just need to find a story to fit it -"
"Trying to ruin someone else's life?" said Harry loudly.
A few people looked around. Rita Skeeter's eyes widened behind her jeweled
spectacles as she saw who had spoken.
"Harry!" she said, beaming. "How lovely! Why don't you come and join- ?"
"I wouldn't come near you with a ten-foot broomstick," said Harry furiously.
"What did you do that to Hagrid for, eh?"
Rita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.
"Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am merely doing my—“
"Who cares if he's half-giant?" Harry shouted. "There's nothing wrong with
him!"
The whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta was staring over from
behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling
with mead was overflowing.
Rita Skeeters smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at
once; she snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her QuickQuotes Quill, and said, "How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid
you know. Harry? The man behind the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and
the reasons behind it. Would you call him a father substitute?"
Hermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though
it were a grenade.
"You horrible woman," she said, through gritted teeth, "you don't care, do you,
anything for a story, and anyone will do, wont they? Even Ludo Bagman -"
"Sit down, you silly little girl, and don't talk about things you don't understand,"
said Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione. "I know
things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl... not that it needs it
-" she added, eyeing Hermione's bushy hair.
"Let's go," said Hermione, "c'mon. Harry - Ron . .."
They left; many people were staring at them as they went. Harry glanced back
as they reached the door. Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill was out; it was
zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table.
"She'll be after you next, Hermione," said Ron in a low and worried voice as
they walked quickly back up the street.
"Let her try!" said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage. "I'll show
her! Silly little girl, am I? Oh, I'll get her back for this. First Harry, then
Hagrid ..."
"You don't want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter," said Ron nervously. "I'm serious,
Hermione, she'll dig up something on you -"
"My parents don't read the Daily Prophet. She can't scare me into hiding!"
said Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could
do to keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like
this, she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face. "And Hagrid isn't hiding
anymore! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him!
Come on!"
Breaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road, through the
gates flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to Hagrid's cabin.
The curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking as they
approached.
"Hagrid!" Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. "Hagrid, that's
enough! We know you're in there! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess,
Hagrid! You can't let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you! Hagrid, get out
here, you're just being -"
The door opened. Hermione said, "About t-!" and then stopped, very suddenly,
because she had found herself face-to-face, not with Hagrid, but with Albus
Dumbledore.
"Good afternoon," he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.
"We-er-we wanted to see Hagrid," said Hermione in a rather small voice.
"Yes, I surmised as much," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. "Why don't
you come in?"
"Oh . . . um ... okay," said Hermione.
She, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon Harry the
moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry fended off
Fang and looked around.
Hagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea. He
looked a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to
the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it
behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire.
"Hi, Hagrid," said Harry.
Hagrid looked up.
"'Lo," he said in a very hoarse voice.
"More tea, I think," said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron, and
Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray
appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore magicked the tray
onto the table, and everybody sat down. There was a slight pause, and then
Dumbledore said, "Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was
shouting, Hagrid?"
Hermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued,
"Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way
they were attempting to break down the door."
"Of course we still want to know you!" Harry said, staring at Hagrid. "You
don't think anything that Skeeter cow - sorry, Professor," he added quickly,
looking at Dumbledore.
"I have gone temporarily deaf and haven't any idea what you said. Harry," said
Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.
"Er-right," said Harry sheepishly. "I just meant-Hagrid, how could you think
we'd care what that-woman-wrote about you?"
Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his
tangled beard.
"Living proof of what I've been telling you, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, still
looking carefully up at the ceiling. "I have shown you the letters from the
countless parents who remember you from their own days here, telling me in no
uncertain terms that if I sacked you, they would have something to say about it -
"
"Not all of 'em," said Hagrid hoarsely. "Not all of 'em wan me ter stay.”
"Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I'm afraid you
will be in this cabin for a very long time," said Dumbledore, now peering
sternly over his half-moon spectacles. "Not a week has passed since I became
headmaster of this school when I haven't had at least one owl complaining about
the way I run it. But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and
refuse to talk to anybody?"
"Yeh - yeh're not half-giant!" said Hagrid croakily.
"Hagrid, look what I've got for relatives!" Harry said furiously. "Look at the
Dursleys!"
"An excellent point," said Professor Dumbledore. "My own brother, Aberforth,
was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over
the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and
went about his business as usual! Of course, I'm not entirely sure he can read, so
that may not have been bravery. . .."
"Come back and teach, Hagrid," said Hermione quietly, "please come back, we
really miss you."
Hagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled
beard.
Dumbledore stood up. "I refuse to accept your resignation, Hagrid, and I
expect you back at work on Monday," he said. "You will join me for breakfast
at eight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon to you all."
Dumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fangs ears. When the door
had shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his dustbin-lid-sized hands.
Hermione kept patting his arm, and at last, Hagrid looked up, his eyes very red
indeed, and said, "Great man, Dumbledore . . . great man . .."
"Yeah, he is," said Ron. "Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?"
"Help yerself," said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. "Ar, he's
righ', o' course - yeh're all righ' . . .I bin stupid . .. my ol' dad woulda bin
ashamed o' the way I've bin behavin'...." More tears leaked out, but he wiped
them away more forcefully, and said, "Never shown you a picture of my old
dad, have I? Here..."
Hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a
picture of a short wizard with Hagrid's crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat
on top of Hagrid's shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging
by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round, and
smooth - he looked hardly older than eleven.
"Tha was taken jus' after I got inter Hogwarts," Hagrid croaked. "Dad was
dead chuffed ... thought I migh' not be a wizard, see, 'cos me mum ... well,
anyway. 'Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really... but at least he
never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me second year. . . .”
"Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me the
gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives 'em second chances ... tha's
what sets him apar' from other heads, see. He'll accept anyone at Hogwarts,
s'long as they've got the talent. Knows people can turn out okay even if their
families weren' ... well... all tha' respectable. But some don understand that.
There's some who'd always hold it against yeh . . . there's some who'd even
pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an' say - I am what I am, an'
I'm not ashamed. 'Never be ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some
who'll hold it against you, but they're not worth botherin' with.' An' he was right.
I've bin an idiot. I'm not botherin' with her no more, I promise yeh that. Big
bones . . . I'll give her big bones."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another nervously; Harry would
rather have taken fifty Blast-Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid
that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime, but Hagrid was still
talking, apparently unaware that he had said anything odd.
"Yeh know wha, Harry?" he said, looking up from the photograph of his father,
his eyes very bright, "when I firs' met you, you reminded me o' me a bit. Mum
an' Dad gone, an' you was feelin' like yeh wouldn' fit in at Hogwarts,
remember? Not sure yeh were really up to it... an' now look at yeh, Harry!
School champion!"
He looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very seriously, "Yeh know
what I'd love. Harry? I'd love yeh ter win, I really would. It'd show 'em all...
yeh don' have ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh don have ter be ashamed of what
yeh are. It'd show 'em Dumbledore's the one who's got it righ', lettin' anyone in
as long as they can do magic. How you doin' with that egg, Harry?"
"Great," said Harry. "Really great."
Hagrid's miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile.
"Tha's my boy. . . you show 'em, Harry, you show 'em. Beat 'em all."
Lying to Hagrid wasn't quite like lying to anyone else. Harry went back to the
castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image
of the happy expression on Hagrid's whiskery face as he had imagined Harry
winning the tournament. The incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than
ever on Harrys conscience that evening, and by the time he had got into bed, he
had made up his mind - it was time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric's hint
was worth anything.
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE – THE EGG AND THE EYE
Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the
golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be able to take as much
time as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to accept more favors from Cedric,
he also decided to use the prefects' bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in
there, so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed.
Harry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of bed
and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before,
and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak would, of
course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would take
the Marauders Map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid to rulebreaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its
many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most important of all, it revealed
the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the
corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the
bathroom.
On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back
downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him
the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who
waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password ("banana fritters"), "Good
luck," Ron muttered, climbing into the room as Harry crept out past him.
It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because Harry had the heavy
egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other.
However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map
at strategic intervals, Harry was able to ensure that he wouldn't run into anyone
he wanted to avoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lostlooking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door,
leaned close to it, and muttered the password, "Pine fresh," just as Cedric had
told him.
The door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and
pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.
His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be
able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled
chandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked
like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor.
About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pools edges, each with a
differently colored Jewel set into its handle. There was also a diving board.
Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white
towels sat in a corner, and there was a single golden-framed painting on the
wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who
was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she
snored.
Harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls.
Magnificent though the bathroom was - and quite keen though he was to try out
a few of those taps - now he was here he couldn't quite suppress the feeling that
Cedric might have been having him on. How on earth was this supposed to help
solve the mystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the Huffy towels, the
cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then
knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.
He could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with
the water, though it wasn't bubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it. One
tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice-white
foam so thick that Harry thought it would have supported his weight if he'd
cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the
surface of the water. Harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and
off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of
the water in large arcs. Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam,
and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size, Harry turned off
all the taps, pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the
water.
It was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a
couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring
at the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water
with clouds of different-colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of
brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding.
Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it. The
wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the
marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so
with all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would
attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn't been Cedric's plan - and then,
making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across
the bathroom floor, someone spoke.
"I'd try putting it in the water, if I were you."
Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up,
sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-legged on
top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard
sobbing in the S-bend of a toilet three floors below.
"Myrtle!" Harry said in outrage, "I'm - I'm not wearing anything!"
The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that
Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had
arrived.
"I closed my eyes when you got in," she said, blinking at him through her thick
spectacles. "You haven't been to see me for ages.”
"Yeah . . . well. . ." said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make
absolutely sure Myrtle couldn't see anything but his head, "I'm not supposed to
come into your bathroom, am I? It's a girls' one."
"You didn't used to care," said Myrtle miserably. "You used to be in there all
the time."
This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found
Myrtle's out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in
secret - a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas of
Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin
common room.
"I got told off for going in there.” said Harry, which was half-true; Percy had
once caught him coming out of Myrtles bathroom. "I thought I'd better not
come back after that."
"Oh ... I see ..." said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of
way. "Well... anyway... I'd try the egg in the water. That's what Cedric Diggory
did."
"Have you been spying on him too?" said Harry indignantly. "What d'you do,
sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?"
"Sometimes," said Myrtle, rather slyly, "but I've never come out to speak to
anyone before."
“I’m honored," said Harry darkly. "You keep your eyes shut!"
He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of
the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve the
egg. Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and
said, "Go on, then . .. open it under the water!"
Harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it... and this time,
it did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out of it, a song whose words he
couldnt distinguish through the water.
"You need to put your head under too," said Myrtle, who seemed to be
thoroughly enjoying bossing him around. "Go on!"
Harry took a great breath and slid under the surface - and now, sitting on the
marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices
singing to him from the open egg in his hands:
"Come seek us where our voices sound,
We cannot sing above the ground,
And while you re searching, ponder this:
Wove taken what you’ll sorely miss,
An hour long you’ll have to look,
And to recover what we took,
But past an hour- the prospect's black,
Too late, it's gone, it wont come back"
Harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking his
hair out of his eyes.
"Hear it?" said Myrtle.
"Yeah ... 'Come seek us where our voices sound .. .' and if I need persuading ...
hang on, I need to listen again...."
He sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater renditions of
the egg's song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod water for a while,
thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him.
"I've got to go and look for people who can't use their voices above the ground. .
. ." he said slowly. "Er . . . who could that be?"
"Slow, aren't you?"
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a dose
of PolyJuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat. Harry
stared around the bathroom, thinking ... if the voices could only be heard
underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures. He
ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.
"Well, thats what Diggory thought," she said. "He lay there talking to himself
for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had gone. ..."
"Underwater ..." Harry said slowly. "Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake, apart
from the giant squid?"
"Oh all sorts," she said. "I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don't have
any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I'm not expecting it...."
Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake
with the contents of a toilet. Harry said, "Well, does anything in there have a
human voice? Hang on -"
Harry's eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall.
"Myrtle, there aren't merpeople in there, are there?"
"Oooh, very good," she said, her thick glasses twinkling, "it took Diggory much
longer than that! And that was with her awake too" - Myrtle jerked her head
toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face -
"giggling and showing off and flashing her fins.. .."
"Thats it, isn't it?" said Harry excitedly. "The second tasks to go and find the
merpeople in the lake and ... and ..."
But he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the excitement drain
out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach. He wasn't
a very good swimmer; he'd never had much practice. Dudley had had lessons in
his youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that Harry
would drown one day, hadn't bothered to give him any. A couple of lengths of
this bath were all very well, but that lake was very large, and very deep . . . and
merpeople would surely live right at the bottom. . . .
"Myrtle," Harry said slowly, "how am I supposed to breathe?”
At this, Myrtle's eyes filled with sudden tears again.
"Tactless!" she muttered, groping in her robes for a handkerchief.
"What's tactless?" said Harry, bewildered.
"Talking about breathing in front of me!" she said shrilly, and her voice echoed
loudly around the bathroom. "When I can't. . . when I haven't. . . not for ages
..."
She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly. Harry remembered
how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other
ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it.
"Sorry," he said impatiently. "I didn't mean - I just forgot. . ."
"Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle's dead," said Myrtle, gulping, looking at
him out of swollen eyes. "Nobody missed me even when I was alive. Took
them hours and hours to find my body - I know, I was sitting there waiting for
them. Olive Hornby came into the bathroom - Are you in here again, sulking,
Myrtle?' she said, 'because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you -' And
then she saw my body . . . ooooh, she didn't forget it until her dying day, I made
sure of that... followed her around and reminded her, I did. I remember at her
brother's wedding -"
But Harry wasn't listening; he was thinking about the merpeople's song again.
"We've taken what you II sorely miss." That sounded as though they were
going to steal something of his, something he had to get back. What were they
going to take?
“--and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me stalking
her, so I had to come back here and live in my toilet."
"Good," said Harry vaguely. "Well, I'm a lot further on than I was. . . . Shut
your eyes again, will you? I'm getting out."
He retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out, dried himself,
and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again.
"Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime?" Moaning
Myrtle asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.
"Er . . . I'll try," Harry said, though privately thinking the only way he'd be
visiting Myrtle's bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got
blocked. "See you. thanks for your help."
“Bye, 'bye," she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibllity Cloak he
saw her zoom back up the tap.
Out in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauders Map to check that the
coast was still clear. Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris,
were safely in their office . .. nothing else seemed to be moving apart from
Peeves, though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above. ...
Harry had taken his first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something
else on the map caught his eye . . . something distinctly odd.
Peeves was not the only thing that was moving. A single dot was flitting
around a room in the bottom left-hand corner - Snapes office. But the dot
wasn't labeled "Severus Snape" ... it was Bartemius Crouch.
Harry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or
to come to the Yule Ball - so what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one
o'clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as the dot moved around and
around the room, pausing here and there. ...
Harry hesitated, thinking . . . and then his curiosity got the better of him. He
turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase. He was
going to see what Crouch was up to.
Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of
the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of his
pajamas. He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about
halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would
take him down two floors. He kept glancing down at the map, wondering ... It
just didn't seem in character, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr. Crouch to
be sneaking around somebody else's office this late at night....
And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing,
not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch, Harrys
leg suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always forgot to jump.
He gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath,
slipped from under his arm. He lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late;
the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every
step - the Invisibility Cloak slipped - Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder s
Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to
above his knee, he couldn't reach it.
The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst
open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out his
wand and struggled to touch the Marauder s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was
too far away to reach -
Pulling the cloak back over himself Harry straightened up, listening hard with
his eyes screwed up with fear. . . and, almost immediately –
"PEEVES!"
It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker. Harry could hear
his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised
in fury.
"What's this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I'll have you, Peeves,
I'll have you, you'll... and what is this?"
Filch's footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing
stopped - Filch had picked up the egg and closed it. Harry stood very still, one
leg still Jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any moment now, Filch
was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there would
be no Peeves ... but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the Marauder's Map .
. . and Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would show "Harry Potter" standing
exactly where he was.
"Egg?" Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. "My sweet!" - Mrs. Norris
was obviously with him - "This is a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a school
champion!"
Harry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast -
"PEEVES!" Filch roared gleefully. "You've been stealing!"
He ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible, pouchy face and
bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase.
"Hiding, are you?" he said softly. "I'm coming to get you, Peeves. . . . You’ve
gone and stolen a Triwizard clue, Peeves... . Dumbledore’ll have you out of
here for this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. ..."
Filch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-colored cat at his heels. Mrs.
Morris's lamp-like eyes, so very like her masters, were fixed directly upon
Harry. He had had occasion before now to wonder whether the Invisibility
Cloak worked on cats. . . . Sick with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing
nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown - he tried desperately to pull
his trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches - any second now,
Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him -
"Filch? Whats going on?"
Filch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At the foot of the stairs stood
the only person who could make Harry's situation worse: Snape. He was
wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid.
"Its Peeves, Professor," Filch whispered malevolently. "He threw this egg down
the stairs."
Snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch. Harry gritted his
teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second.
. . .
"Peeves?" said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch's hands. "But Peeves
couldn't get into my office. . . ."
"This egg was in your office. Professor?"
"Of course not," Snape snapped. "I heard banging and wailing -"
"Yes, Professor, that was the egg -"
"- I was coming to investigate -"
"- Peeves threw it. Professor -"
“- and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard
door was ajar! Somebody has been searching it!"
But Peeves couldn't -"
"I know he couldn't, Filch!" Snape snapped again. "I seal my office with a spell
none but a wizard could break!" Snape looked up the stairs, straight through
Harry, and then down into the corridor below. "I want you to come and help
me search for the intruder, Filch."
"I - yes, Professor - but -"
Filch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who could see that
he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves. Go, Harry
pleaded with him silently, go with Snape . . . go. . . Mrs. Norris was peering
around Filch's legs.... Harry had the distinct impression that she could smell
him.. . . Why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foam?
"The thing is, Professor," said Filch plaintively, "the headmaster will have to
listen to me this time. Peeves has been stealing from a student, it might be my
chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all -"
"Filch, I don't give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it's my office that's -"
Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.
Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the
foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the
narrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak
over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual.
"Pajama party, is it?" he growled up the stairs.
"Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor," said Filch at once. "Peeves the
Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual - and then Professor Snape
discovered that someone had broken into his off -"
"Shut up!" Snape hissed to Filch.
Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moodys magical
eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself.
Harrys heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through Invisibility
Cloaks... he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene:
Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the
stairs behind them. Moody's lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a
few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other's eyes. Then Moody
closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again.
"Did I hear that correctly, Snape?" he asked slowly. "Someone broke into your
office?"
"It is unimportant," said Snape coldly. "On the contrary," growled Moody, "it
is very important. Who'd want to break into your office?"
"A student, I daresay," said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly
on Snape's greasy temple. "It has happened before. Potion ingredients have
gone missing from my private store cupboard ... students attempting illicit
mixtures, no doubt...."
"Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?" said Moody. "Not hiding
anything else in your office, are you?"
Harry saw the edge of Snapes sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in
his temple pulsing more rapidly.
"You know I'm hiding nothing, Moody," he said in a soft and dangerous voice,
"as you've searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself."
Moodys face twisted into a smile. "Auror's privilege, Snape. Dumbledore told
me to keep an eye -"
"Dumbledore happens to trust me,” said Snape through clenched teeth. "I
refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office!"
"Course Dumbledore trusts you," growled Moody. "Hes a trusting man, isn't
he? Believes in second chances. But me - I say there are spots that don't come
off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d'you know what I mean?"
Snape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm
convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him.
Moody laughed. "Get back to bed, Snape."
"You don't have the authority to send me anywhere!" Snape hissed, letting go
of his arm as though angry with himself. "I have as much right to prowl this
school after dark as you do!"
"Prowl away," said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. "I look forward
to meeting you in a dark corridor some time.... You've dropped something, by
the way. ..."
With a stab of horror. Harry saw Moody point at the Marauders Map, still lying
on the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and Filch both turned to look at
it, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his arms under the cloak and
waved furiously at Moody to attract his attention, mouthing "It's mine! Mine!”
Snape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning comprehension
on his face -
"Accio Parchment!"
The map flew up into the air, slipped through Snapes outstretched fingers, and
soared down the stairs into Moodys hand.
"My mistake," Moody said calmly. "It's mine - must've dropped it earlier -"
But Snape's black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch's arms to the map in
Moodys hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together, as
only Snape could. . . .
"Potter," he said quietly.
"What's that?" said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.
"Potter!" Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the
place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. "That egg is
Potters egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before, I
recognize it! Potter is here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!"
Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs;
Harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff
Harry out - trapped. Harry leaned backward, trying to avoid Snapes fingertips,
but any moment now-
"There's nothing there, Snape!" barked Moody, "but I'll be happy to tell the
headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter!"
"Meaning what?" Snape turned again to look at Moody, his hands still
outstretched, inches from Harry's chest.
"Meaning that Dumbledore's very interested to know who's got it in for that
boy!" said Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs. "And so am I,
Snape . . . very interested...." The torchlight flickered across his mangled face,
so that the scars, and the chunk missing from
his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever.
Snape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn't see the expression on
his face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape slowly
lowered his hands.
"I merely thought," said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, "that if Potter was
wandering around after hours again ... it's an unfortunate habit of his ... he
should be stopped. For - for his own safety."
"Ah, I see," said Moody softly. "Got Potter's best interests at heart, have you?"
There was a pause. Snape and Moody were still staring at each other, Mrs.
Norris gave a loud meow, still peering around Filch's legs, looking for the
source of Harry's bubble-bath smell.
"I think I will go back to bed," Snape said curtly.
"Best idea you've had all night," said Moody. "Now, Filch, if you'll just give
me that egg-"
"No!" said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son.
"Professor Moody, this is evidence of Peeves' treachery!"
"It’s the property of the champion he stole it from," said Moody. Hand it over,
now.”
Snape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another word. Filch made a
chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more
seconds before turning and following her master. Still breathing very fast.
Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the
egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris. "Never mind. my
sweet.. . we'll see Dumbledore in the morning ... tell him what Peeves was up
to...."
A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his staff
on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull
clunk on every other step.
"Close shave. Potter," he muttered.
"Yeah ... I - er ... thanks," said Harry weakly.
"What is this thing?" said Moody, drawing the Marauder's Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
"Map of Hogwarts," said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the
staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
"Merlins beard," Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going
haywire. "This . .. this is some map. Potter!"
"Yeah, its . . . quite useful," Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from the
pain. "Er - Professor Moody, d'you think you could help me - ?"
"What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . .."
Moody took hold of Harrys arms and pulled; Harrys leg came free of the trick
step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the map.
"Potter ..." he said slowly, "you didn't happen, by any chance, to see who broke
into Snapes office, did you? On this map, I mean?”
"Er . . . yeah, I did . . ." Harry admitted. "It was Mr. Crouch."
Moodys magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He looked
suddenly alarmed.
"Crouch?" he said. "You're - you're sure. Potter?"
"Positive," said Harry.
"Well, he's not here anymore," said Moody, his eye still whizzing over the map.
"Crouch . .. that's very - very interesting... ."
He said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map. Harry could tell
that this news meant something to Moody and very much wanted to know what
it was. He wondered whether he dared ask. Moody scared him slightly. . . yet
Moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble. . . .
"Er ... Professor Moody . . . why d'you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look
around Snapes office?"
Moodys magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It was a
penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up,
wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him.
"Put it this way. Potter," Moody muttered finally, "they say old Mad-Eye's
obsessed with catching Dark wizards . . . but I'm nothing – nothing - compared
to Barty Crouch."
He continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more.
"Professor Moody?" he said again. "D'you think... could this have anything to
do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there's something going on. ..."
"Like what?" said Moody sharply.
Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn't want Moody to guess that he
had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky
questions about Sirius.
"I don't know," Harry muttered, "odd stuffs been happening lately, hasn't it? It's
been in the Daily Prophet... the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death
Eaters and everything...."
Both of Moody's mismatched eyes widened.
"You're a sharp boy. Potter," he said. His magical eye roved back to the
Marauder's Map. "Crouch could be thinking along those lines," he said slowly.
"Very possible. . . there have been some funny rumors flying around lately -
helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It's making a lot of people nervous, I
reckon." A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. "Oh if there's one thing I
hate," he muttered, more to himself than to Harry, and his magical eye was
fixed on the left-hand corner of the map, "its a Death Eater who walked free. ..."
Harry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he
meant?
"And now I want to ask you a question. Potter," said Moody in a more
businesslike tone.
Harrys heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to ask
where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical object - and the
story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him, but his own
father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map in front of Harry, who
braced himself-
"Can I borrow this?"
"Oh!" said Harry.
He was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved
that Moody wasn't asking where he'd got it, and there was no doubt that he
owed Moody a favor.
"Yeah, okay."
"Good boy," growled Moody. “I can make good use of this . .. this might be
exactly what I've been looking for. . . . Right, bed, Potter, come on, now. ..."
They climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the map as
though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before. They
walked in silence to the door of Moody's office, where he stopped and looked up
at Harry.
"You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?"
"No," said Harry, taken aback.
"You want to consider it," said Moody, nodding and looking at Harry
thoughtfully. "Yes, indeed ... and incidentally ... I'm guessing you werent Just
taking that egg for a walk tonight?"
"Er - no," said Harry, grinning. "I've been working out the clue.”
Moody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again. "Nothing like a
nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter. . .. See you in the morning...."
He went back into his office, staring down at the Marauders Map again, and
closed the door behind him.
Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about Snape,
and Crouch, and what it all meant.... Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he
could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he think Snape
was concealing in his office?
And Moody thought he. Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea.. . but
somehow. Harry thought, as he got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later,
the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought he'd like to check
how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career.
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX – THE SECOND TASK
You said you'd already worked out that egg clue!" said Hermione indignantly.
"Keep your voice down!" said Harry crossly. "I just need to - sort of fine-tune
it, all right?"
He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a
table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the
Summoning Charm today - the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for
nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room. Professor Flitwick
had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory
being that these wouldn't hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good
theory, but it wasn't working very well. Neville's aim was so poor that he kept
accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room - Professor
Flitwick, for instance.
"Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?" Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick
went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top of a large cabinet. "I'm
trying to tell you about Snape and Moody. ..."
This class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having
far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been recounting his
adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.
"Snape said Moodys searched his office as well?" Ron whispered, his eyes
alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared
into the air and knocked Parvati's hat off). "What. . . d'you reckon Moody's
here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff?"
"Well, I dunno if that's what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he's definitely
doing it," said Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that
his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk. "Moody said Dumbledore
only lets Snape stay here because he's giving him a second chance or something.
..."
"What?" said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into the
air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick's desk.
"Harry... maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire!"
"Oh Ron," said Hermione, shaking her head sceptically, "we thought Snape was
trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry's life,
remember?"
She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they
were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking... it was
true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely
loathed him, just as he'd loathed Harry s father when they had been at school
together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed
an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be
suspended from the school.
"I don't care what Moody says," Hermione went on. "Dumbledore's not stupid.
He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people
wouldn't have given them jobs, so why shouldn't he be right about Snape, even
if Snape is a bit -"
"- evil," said Ron promptly. "Come on, Hermione, why are all these Dark
wizard catchers searching his office, then?"
"Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?" said Hermione, ignoring Ron.
"Its a bit funny, isn't it, that he cant manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can
get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to?"
"You just don't like Crouch because of that elf, Winky," said Ron, sending a
cushion soaring into the window.
"You just want to think Snapes up to something," said Hermione, sending her
cushion zooming neatly into the box.
"I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he’s on his second
one," said Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight
across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione’s.
Obedient to Sirius's wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent
him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking
into Snape s office, and Moody and Snape's conversation. Then Harry turned
his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive
underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.
Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again - Harry had
explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn't see why Harry shouldn't
Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by
pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to
operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be
disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy - it was
too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming across
the countryside to Hogwarts.
"Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a
submarine or something," Hermione said. "If only we'd done human
Transfiguration already! But I don't think we start that until sixth year, and it
can go badly wrong if you don't know what you're doing...."
"Yeah, I don't fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,"
said Harry. "I s'pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody; he
might do it for me...."
"I don't think he'd let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,"
said Hermione seriously. "No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm."
So Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last
him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for
any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However,
though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and
whole weekends - though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of
permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulturelike librarian. Madam Pince, for help - they found nothing whatsoever that
would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, and he was
finding it difficult to concentrate in class again. The lake, which Harry had
always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes
whenever he was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly
water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.
Just as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was slipping away as though
somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra-fast. There was a week to go
before February the twenty-fourth (there was still time) . . . there were five days
to go (he was bound to find something soon) .. . three days to go (please let me
find something... please). . .
With two days left. Harry started to go off food again. The only good thing
about breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to
Sirius. He pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter
Sirius had ever written to him.
Send date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl.
Harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see
something else, but it was blank.
"Weekend after next," whispered Hermione, who had read the note over Harrys
shoulder. "Here - take my quill and send this owl back straight away."
Harry scribbled the dates down on the back of Sirius's letter, tied it onto the
brown owl's leg, and watched it take flight again. What had he expected?
Advice on how to survive underwater? He had been so intent on telling Sirius
all about Snape and Moody he had completely forgotten to mention the eggs
clue.
"What's he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for?" said Ron.
"Dunno," said Harry dully. The momentary happiness that had flared inside
him at the sight of the owl had died. "Come on ...Care of Magical Creatures."
Whether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast-Ended Skrewts, or because
there were now only two skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he
could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank could. Harry didnt know, but
Hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he'd returned to
work. It turned out that Hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did
about monsters, though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs
disappointing.
Today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals. Unlike full-grown
unicorns, they were pure gold. Parvati and Lavender went into transports of
delight at the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had to work hard to
conceal how much she liked them.
"Easier ter spot than the adults," Hagrid told the class. "They turn silver when
they're abou' two years old, an' they grow horns at aroun four. Don' go pure
white till they're full grown, 'round about seven. They're a bit more trustin
when they're babies .. . don mind boys so much.... C'mon, move in a bit, yeh can
pat 'em if yeh want. . . give 'em a few o' these sugar lumps. . . .
"You okay. Harry?" Hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of the
others swarmed around the baby unicorns.
"Yeah," said Harry. "Jus' nervous, eh?" said Hagrid.
"Bit," said Harry.
"Harry," said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that Harry's
knees buckled under its weight, "I’d've bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha
Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin' yeh set yer mind ter. I'm not
worried at all. Yeh're goin ter be fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven' yeh?"
Harry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess that he didn't
have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over
him. He looked up at Hagrid - perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to
deal with the creatures in it? He looked after everything else on the grounds,
after all-
"Yeh're goin’ ter win," Hagrid growled, patting Harrys shoulder again, so that
Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground. "I know
it. I can feel it. Yeh’re goin’ ter win, Harry n
Harry just couldn't bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off Hagrid's
face. Pretending he was interested in the young unicorns, he forced a smile in
return, and moved forward to pat them with the others.
By the evening before the second task. Harry felt as though he were trapped in
a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to
find a suitable spell, he'd have a real job mastering it overnight. How could he
have let this happen? Why hadn't he got to work on the egg's clue sooner?
Why had he ever let his mind wander in class - what if a teacher had once
mentioned how to breathe underwater?
He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing
feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the
massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry s heart gave
a huge leap every time he saw the word "water" on a page, but more often than
not it was merely "Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake
leaves, and a newt..."
"I don't reckon it can be done," said Rons voice flatly from the other side of the
table. "There's nothing. Nothing. Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and
ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful enough to
drain the lake."
"There must be something," Hermione muttered, moving a candle closer to her.
Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and Forgotten
Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose about an inch from the page.
"They'd never have set a task that was undoable."
"They have," said Ron. "Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick
your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they've nicked, and
see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate."
"There's a way of doing it!" Hermione said crossly. "There Just has to be!"
She seemed to be taking the library's lack of useful information on the subject
as a personal insult; it had never failed her before.
"I know what I should have done," said Harry, resting, face-down, on Saucy
Tricks for Tricky Sorts. "I should've learned to be an Animagus like Sirius."
An Animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal.
"Yeah, you could've turned into a goldfish any time you wanted!" said Ron.
"Or a frog," yawned Harry. He was exhausted. "It takes years to become an
Animagus, and then you have to register yourself and everything," said
Hermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of Weird Wizarding
Dilemmas and Their Solutions. "Professor McGonagall told us, remember...
you've got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic Office ...what
animal you become, and your markings, so you can't abuse
"Hermione, I was joking," said Harry wearily. "I know I haven't got a
chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning...."
"Oh this is no use," Hermione said, snapping shut Weird Wizarding Dilemmas.
"Who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets?"
"I wouldn't mind," said Fred Weasleys voice. "Be a talking point, wouldn't it?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Fred and George had just emerged from
behind some bookshelves.
"What're you two doing here?" Ron asked.
"Looking for you," said George. "McGonagall wants you, Ron. And you,
Hermione."
"Why?" said Hermione, looking surprised.
"Dunno ... she was looking a bit grim, though," said Fred.
"We're supposed to take you down to her office," said George.
Ron and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his stomach drop. Was Professor
McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off? Perhaps she'd noticed how
much they were helping him, when he ought to be working out how to do the
task alone?
"We'll meet you back in the common room," Hermione told Harry as she got up
to go with Ron - both of them looked very anxious. "Bring as many of these
books as you can, okay?"
"Right," said Harry uneasily.
By eight o'clock. Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to
chivvy Harry out of the library. Staggering under the weight of as many books
as he could carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room, pulled a
table into a corner, and continued to search. There was nothing in Madcap
Magic for Wacky Warlocks. . . nothing in A Guide to Medieval Sorcery . . . not
one mention of underwater exploits in An Anthology of Eighteenth-Century
Charms, or in Dreadful Denizens of the Deep, or Powers You Never Knew
You Had and What to Do with Them Now Youve Wised Up.
Crookshanks crawled into Harrys lap and curled up, purring deeply. The
common room emptied slowly around Harry. People kept wishing him luck for
the next morning in cheery, confident voices like Hagrid s, all of them
apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning
performance like the one he had managed in the first task. Harry couldn't
answer them, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his
throat. By ten to midnight, he was alone in the room with Crookshanks. He had
searched all the remaining books, and Ron and Hermione had not come back.
It's over, he told himself. You can't do it. You'll just have to go down to the
lake in the morning and tell the judges....
He imagined himself explaining that he couldn't do the task. He pictured
Bagman's look of round-eyed surprise, Karkaroffs satisfied, yellow-toothed
smile. He could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying “I knew it. . . 'e is too
young, 'e is only a little boy." He saw Malfoy flashing his POTTER STINKS
badge at the front of the crowd, saw Hagrid s crestfallen, disbelieving face. . . .
Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap. Harry stood up very suddenly;
Crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor, gave Harry a disgusted
look, and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air, but Harry was
already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory. ... He would grab the
Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library, he'd stay there all night if he had
to. ...
"Lumos," Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door.
Wand tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves, pulling down more books -
books of hexes and charms, books on merpeople and water monsters, books on
famous witches and wizards, on magical inventions, on anything at all that
might include one passing reference to underwater survival. He carried them
over to a table, then set to work, searching them by the narrow beam of his
wand, occasionally checking his watch. . . .
One in the morning. . . two in the morning . . . the only way he could keep going
was to tell himself, over and over again, next book. . . in the next one. . . the
next one. . .
The mermaid in the painting in the prefects' bathroom was laughing. Harry was
bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while she held his Firebolt
over his head.
"Come and get it!" she giggled maliciously. "Come on, jump!"
"I can't," Harry panted, snatching at the Firebolt, and struggling not to sink.
"Give it to me!"
But she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick,
laughing at him.
"That hurts - get off- ouch -"
"Harry Potter must wake up, sir!"
"Stop poking me -"
"Dobby must poke Harry Potter, sir, he must wake up!"
Harry opened his eyes. He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had
slipped off his head as he'd slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages
of Where There's a Wand, There's a Way. He sat up, straightening his glasses,
blinking in the bright daylight.
"Harry Potter needs to hurry!" squeaked Dobby. "The second task starts in ten
minutes, and Harry Potter -"
"Ten minutes?" Harry croaked. "Ten - ten minutes?”
He looked down at his watch. Dobby was right. It was twenty past nine. A
large, dead weight seemed to fall through Harry's chest into his stomach.
"Hurry, Harry Potter!" squeaked Dobby, plucking at Harry's sleeve. "You is
supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sir!"
"It's too late, Dobby," Harry said hopelessly. "I'm not doing the task, I don't
know how-"
"Harry Potter will do the task!" squeaked the elf. "Dobby knew Harry had not
found the right book, so Dobby did it for him!"
"What?" said Harry. "But you don't know what the second task is –“
"Dobby knows, sir! Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy -"
"Find my what?"
"- and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!"
"What's a Wheezy?"
"Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy-Wheezy who is giving Dobby his sweater!"
Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his
shorts.
"What?" Harry gasped. "They've got. . . they've got Ron?"
"The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!" squeaked Dobby. "'But past an
hour-'"
"- 'the prospect's black,'" Harry recited, staring, horror-struck, at the elf. " 'Too
late, it's gone, it won't come back.' Dobby - what've I got to do?"
"You has to eat this, sir!" s queaked the elf, and he put his hand in the pocket of
his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy, grayish-green rat tails.
"Right before you go into the lake, sir - gillyweed!"
"What's it do?" said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.
"It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!"
"Dobby," said Harry frantically, "listen - are you sure about this?"
He couldn't quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to "help" him, he had
ended up with no bones in his right arm.
"Dobby is quite sure, sir!" said the elf earnestly. "Dobby hears things, sir, he is
a house-elf, he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors.
Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom,
talking about the next task. . . . Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his
Wheezy!"
Harrys doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility
Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket,
then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.
"Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!" Dobby squealed as they burst
into the corridor. "Dobby will be missed - good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good
luck!"
"See you later, Dobby!" Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and
down the stairs, three at a time.
The entrance hall contained a few last-minute stragglers, all leaving the Great
Hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the
second task. They stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis
Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly
grounds.
As he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the
dragons' enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank,
rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake
below. The excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as
Harry ran flat-out around the other side of the lake toward the judges, who were
sitting at another gold-draped table at the water's edge. Cedric, Fleur, and
Krum were beside the judges' table, watching Harry sprint toward them.
"I'm . .. here ..." Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally
splattering Fleurs robes.
"Where have you been?" said a bossy, disapproving voice. "The task's about to
start!"
Harry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges' table - Mr.
Crouch had failed to turn up again.
"Now, now, Percy!" said Ludo Bagman, who was looking intensely relieved to
see Harry. "Let him catch his breath!"
Dumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn't look
at all pleased to see him. ... It was obvious from the looks on their faces that
they had thought he wasn't going to turn up.
Harry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath; he had a stitch in his
side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs, but there was no time to
get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions, spacing
them along the bank at intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end of the
line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his
wand ready.
"All right. Harry?" Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few feet farther
away from Krum. "Know what you're going to do?"
"Yeah," Harry panted, massaging his ribs.
Bagman gave Harry's shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges'
table; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said,
"Sonorus!" and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands.
"Well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my
whistle. They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them.
On the count of three, then. One . . . two . . . three!"
The whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the stands erupted with cheers
and applause; without looking to see what the other champions were doing,
Harry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his
pocket, stuffed it into his mouth, and waded out into the lake.
It was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire, not icy
water. His sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper; now the
water was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt
and flat, slimy stones. He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he
could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles. Waist-deep
in the freezing water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to
happen.
He could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking
into the lake without showing any sign of magical power. The part of him that
was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a
cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided
looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls
and jeering from the Slytherins. ...
Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed
over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head spin; his
lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck
-
Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his
ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . He had gills. Without pausing to think, he did
the only thing that made sense - he flung himself forward into the water.
The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had stopped
spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through
his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front
of him and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and
they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet - they
had become elongated and the toes were webbed too:
It looked as though he had sprouted flippers.
The water didn't feel icy anymore either ... on the contrary, he felt pleasantly
cool and very light. . . . Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and
fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the vater, and noticing how
clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had
soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. He
flipped over and dived into its depths.
Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy
landscape. He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped throuugh
the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness:
forests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull,
glimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the
lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the
shadow beyond, where the water became opaque.
Small fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he saw
something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it
to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed. There was
no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron - nor, thankfully, the
giant squid.
Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep,
like a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead
of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom . . . and then, without
warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.
Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water
demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry's
leg, its pointed fangs bared - Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his
robes and fumbled for his wand. By the time he had grasped it, two more
grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry's robes, and
were attempting to drag him down.
"Relashio!" Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. ... A large bubble
issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the
grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where
it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his
ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally
sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then
he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard;
finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the
dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at
Harry and sank back into the weed.
Harry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back inside his robes, and looked
around, listening again. He turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing
harder than ever against his eardrums. He knew he must be even deeper in the
lake now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed.
"How are you getting on?"
Harry thought he was having a heart attack. He whipped around and saw
Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her thick,
pearly glasses.
"Myrtle!" Harry tried to shout - but once again, nothing came out of his mouth
but a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled.
"You want to try over there!" she said, pointing. "I won't come with you. ... I
don't like them much, they always chase me when I get too close. ..."
Harry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks and set off once more, careful
to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be
lurking there.
He swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. He was passing over
vast expanses of black mud now, which swirled murkily as he disturbed the
water. Then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mersong.
"An hour long you'll have to look,
And to recover what we took..."
Harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water
ahead. It had paintings of merpeople on it; they were carrying spears and
chasing what looked like the giant squid. Harry swam on past the rock,
following the mersong.
". . . your time's half gone, so tarry not
Lest what you seek stays here to rot. ..."
A cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of
the gloom on all sides. Here and there at the dark windows, Harry saw faces . .
. faces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the
prefects' bathroom. . . .
The merpeople had grayish skin and long, wild, dark green hair. Their eyes
were yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles
around their necks. They leered at Harry as he swam past; one or two of them
emerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails
beating the water, spears clutched in their hands.
Harry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous;
there were gardens of weed around some of them, and he even saw a pet
grindylow tied to a stake outside one door. Merpeople were emerging on all
sides now, watching him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills,
talking behind their hands to one another. Harry sped around a corner and a
very strange sight met his eyes.
A whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what
looked like a mer-version of a village square. A choir of merpeople was singing
in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude
sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people were
bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.
Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who
looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure
that she was Fleur Delacour's sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very
deep sleep. Their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of
bubbles kept issuing from their mouths.
Harry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their
spears and charge at him, but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the
hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong. For a fleeting second
he thought of the knife Sirius had bought him for Christmas - locked in his
trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever.
He looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying
spears. He swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long green
beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the
spear. The merman laughed and shook his head.
"We do not help," he said in a harsh, croaky voice.
"Come ON!" Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from his mouth), and
he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it
back, still shaking his head and laughing.
Harry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp . . . anything . . .
There were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and snatched up a
particularly jagged one and returned to the statue. He began to hack at the
ropes binding Ron, and after several minutes' hard work, they broke apart. Ron
floated, unconscious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the
ebb of the water.
Harry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other champions. What
were they playing at? Why didn't they hurry up? He turned back to Hermione,
raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at her bindings too -
At once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him. Half a dozen mermen
were pulling him away from Hermione, shaking their green-haired heads, and
laughing.
"You take your own hostage," one of them said to him. "Leave the others ..."
“No way!" said Harry furiously - but only two large bubbles came out.
Your task is to retrieve your own friend . . . leave the others ..." She's my friend
too!" Harry yelled, gesturing toward Hermione, an enormous silver bubble
emerging soundlessly from his lips. "And I don't want them to die either!"
Cho's head was on Hermiones shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly
green and pale. Harry struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed
harder than ever, holding him back. Harry looked wildly around. Where were
the other champions? Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and come
back down for Hermione and the others? Would he be able to find them again?
He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left - it had stopped
working.
But then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head. Harry
looked up and saw Cedric swimming toward them. There was an enormous
bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched.
"Got lost!" he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. "Fleur and Krum're coming
now!"
Feeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his
pocket and cut Cho free. He pulled her upward and out of sight.
Harry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and Krum? Time was
getting short, and according to the song, the hostages would be lost after an
hour. . . .
The merpeople started screeching animatedly. Those holding Harry loosened
their grip, staring behind them. Harry turned and saw something monstrous
cutting through the water toward them: a human body in swimming trunks
with the head of a shark. ... It was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured
himself- but badly.
The shark-man swam straight to Hermione and began snapping and biting at
her ropes; the trouble was that Krum's new teeth were positioned very
awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry was quite sure
that if Krum wasn't careful, he was going to rip Hermione in half. Darting
forward. Harry hit Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone.
Krum seized it and began to cut Hermione free. Within seconds, he had done it;
he grabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a backward glance, began
to rise rapidly with her toward the surface.
Now what? Harry thought desperately. If he could be sure that Fleur was
coming. . . . But still no sign. There was nothing to be done except. . .
He snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, but the mermen now
closed in around Ron and the little girl, shaking their heads at him. Harry pulled
out his wand.
"Get out of the way!"
Only bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct impression that the
mermen had understood him, because they suddenly stopped laughing. Their
yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry's wand, and they looked scared. There
might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the
looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did.
"You've got until three!" Harry shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst from
him, but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message. "One . . ."
(he put down a finger) "two . . ." (he put down a second one) -
They scattered. Harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the
small girl to the statue, and at last she was free. He seized the little girl around
the waist, grabbed the neck of Rons robes, and kicked off from the bottom.
It was very slow work. He could no longer use his webbed hands to propel
himself forward; he worked his flippers furiously, but Ron and Fleur's sister
were like potato-filled sacks dragging him back down. ... He fixed his eyes
skyward, though he knew he must still be very deep, the water above him was
so dark, . . .
Merpeople were rising with him. He could see them swirling around him with
ease, watching him struggle through the water. .. . Would they pull him back
down to the depths when the time was up? Did they perhaps eat humans?
Harry's legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders
were aching horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and the
He was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. He could feel pain on the sides
of his neck again ... he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in
his mouth .. . yet the darkness was definitely thinning now... he could see
daylight above him.. ..
He kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more
than was flooding through his mouth into his lungs ... he was
starting to feel dizzy, but he knew light and air were only ten feet above him ...
he had to get there ... he had to ...
Harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were
screaming in protest; his very brain felt waterlogged, he couldn't breathe, he
needed oxygen, he had to keep going, he could not stop -
And then he felt his head break the surface of the lake; wonderful, cold, clear air
was making his wet face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he had
never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled Ron and the little girl up
with him. All around him, wild, green-haired heads were emerging out of the
water with him, but they were smiling at him.
The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and
screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet; Harry had the impression they
thought that Ron and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong . . . both
of them had opened their eyes; the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron
merely expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to
Harry, and said, "Wet, this, isn't it?" Then he spotted Fleur's sister. "What did
you bring her for?"
"Fleur didn't turn up, I couldn't leave her," Harry panted.
"Harry, you prat," said Ron, "you didn't take that song thing seriously, did you?
Dumbledore wouldn't have let any of us drown!"
"The song said -"
"It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!" said Ron. "I hope
you didn't waste time down there acting the hero!"
Harry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very well for Ron; he'd been
asleep, he hadn't felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spearcarrying merpeople who'd looked more than capable of murder.
"C'mon," Harry said shortly, "help me with her, I don't think she can swim very
well."
They pulled Fleur's sister through the water, back toward the bank where the
judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of
honor, singing their horrible screechy songs.
Harry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over Hermione, Krum, Cedric, and
Cho, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets.
Dumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the bank
as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much
younger than usual, came splashing out to meet them. Meanwhile Madame
Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical,
fighting tooth and nail to return to the water.
"Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Is she alive? Is she 'urt?”
"She's fine!" Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly
talk, let alone shout.
Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank ("Gerroff, Percy, I'm
all right!"); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had
broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.
"It was ze grindylows . . . zey attacked me ... oh Gabrielle, I thought... I
thought.. ."
"Come here, you," said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him
over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt
as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion
down his throat. Steam gushed out of his ears.
"Harry, well done!" Hermione cried. "You did it, you found out how all by
yourself!"
"Well -" said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just
noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the
table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron,
and Fleur's sister had got back safely. "Yeah, that's right," said Harry, raising
his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him.
"You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny," said Krum. Harry had
the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps
to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed
away the beetle impatiently and said, "You're well outside the time limit,
though, Harry. . . . Did it take you ages to find us?"
"No ... I found you okay...."
Harry's feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was out of the water, it
seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledores safety precautions wouldn't have
permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn't turned up.
Why hadn't he just grabbed Ron and gone? He would have been first back....
Cedric and Krum hadn't wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn't
taken the mersong seriously. ...
Dumbledore was crouching at the water's edge, deep in conversation with what
seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly wild and ferocious-looking
female. He was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople
made when they were above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak Mermish.
Finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said, "A conference
before we give the marks, I think."
The judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from
Percy's clutches; she led him over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket
and some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister. Fleur had
many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn't seem to
care, nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.
"Look after Gabrielle," she told her, and then she turned to Harry. "You saved
'er," she said breathlessly. "Even though she was not your 'ostage."
"Yeah," said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he'd left all three girls tied to
the statue.
Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and
wouldn't have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then
said to Ron, "And you too-you 'elped -"
"Yeah," said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, "yeah, a bit -"
Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him. Hermione looked simply
furious, but just then, Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice boomed out
beside them, making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go
very quiet.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision. Merchieftainess Murcus
has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have
therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions, as
follows. . . .
"Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble-Head
Charm, was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to
retrieve her hostage. We award her twenty-five points."
Applause from the stands.
"I deserved zero," said Fleur throatily, shaking her magnificent head.
"Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return
with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an
hour." Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; Harry saw Cho
give Cedric a glowing look. "We therefore award him forty-seven points."
Harrys heart sank. If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly
had been.
"Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration, which was
nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage. We award
him forty points."
Karkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior.
"Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect," Bagman continued. "He returned
last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess
informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in
his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not
merely his own."
Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated, half-commiserating
looks.
"Most of the judges," and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look, "feel
that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks. However . . . Mr. Potter's
score is forty-five points."
Harry's stomach leapt - he was now tying for first place with Cedric. Ron and
Hermione, caught by surprise, stared at Harry, then laughed and started
applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.
"There you go. Harry!" Ron shouted over the noise. "You weren't being thick
after all - you were showing moral fiber!"
Fleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn't look happy at all. He
attempted to engage Hermione in conversation again, but she was too busy
cheering Harry to listen.
"The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of June,"
continued Bagman. "The champions will be notified of what is coming precisely
one month beforehand. Thank you all for your support of the champions."
It was over. Harry thought dazedly, as Madam Pomfrey began herding the
champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes ... it was over,
he had got through ... he didn't have to worry about anything now until June the
twenty-fourth. . ..
Next time he was in Hogsmeade, Harry decided as he walked back up the stone
steps into the castle, he was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of
the year.
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN – PADFOOT RETURNS
One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that
everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the
lake, which meant that Ron was getting to share Harry's limelight for once.
Harry noticed that Ron's version of events changed subtly with every retelling.
At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione's story,
anyway - Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in
Professor McGonagall's office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe,
and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later,
however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled singlehandedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into
submission before tying him up.
"But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve," he assured Padma Patil, who
seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and
was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors. "I
could've taken those mer-idiots any time I wanted."
"What were you going to do, snore at them?" said Hermione waspishly. People
had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would
most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.
Ron's ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of
events.
As they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their
hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds. There were delays
in the post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that
Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at
breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way;
Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius's reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it
was going to be sent outside again.
Sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one.
Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and
Banges) at two o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Bring as much
food as you can.
"He hasn't come back to Hogsmeade?" said Ron incredulously.
"It looks like it, doesn't it?" said Hermione.
"I can't believe him," said Harry tensely, "if he's caught. . ."
"Made it so far, though, hasn't he?" said Ron. "And it's not like the place is
swarming with dementors anymore."
Harry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest with himself, he really
wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the
afternoon - double Potions - feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually
did when descending the steps to the dungeons.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom
door with Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking
at something Harry couldn't see and sniggering heartily. Pansys pug-like face
peered excitedly around Goyle's broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione
approached.
"There they are, there they are!" she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke
apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands - Witch Weekly. The
moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was smiling
toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.
"You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!" Pansy said
loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking
startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them
all inside.
Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as
usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of
todays potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine
under the desk. At last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were
looking for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color photograph of Harry
headed a short piece entitled:
Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache
A boy like no other, perhaps - yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of
adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter. Deprived of love since the tragic demise
of his parents, fourteen-year-old Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his
steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle-born Hermione Granger. Little did he
know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life
already littered with personal loss.
Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous
wizards that Harry alone cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor
Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss
Granger has been toying with both boys' affections. Krum, who is openly
smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in
Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has "never felt this way
about any other girl."
However, it might not be Miss Granger's doubtful natural charms that have
captured these unfortunate boys' interest.
"She's really ugly," says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth-year
student, "but she'd be well up to making a Love Potion, she's quite brainy. I
think that's how she's doing it."
Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus
Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry
Potters well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a
worthier candidate.
"I told you!" Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article. "I told
you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She's made you out to be some sort of- of scarlet
woman!"
Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. "Scarlet
woman?" she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around
at Ron.
"It's what my mum calls them," Ron muttered, his ears going red.
"If that's the best Rita can do, she's losing her touch," said Hermione, still
giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her. "What a
pile of old rubbish."
She looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry closely
across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave
them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking
the ingredients they would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.
"There's something funny, though," said Hermione ten minutes later, holding
her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles. "How could Rita Skeeter
have known . . . ?"
"Known what?" said Ron quickly. "You haven't been mixing up Love Potions,
have you?"
"Don't be stupid," Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again.
"No, it's just. . . how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the
summer?"
Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron's eyes.
"What?" said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.
"He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,"
Hermione muttered. "After he'd got rid of his shark's head. Madam Pomfrey
gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so
they wouldn't hear, and he said, if I wasn't doing anything over the summer,
would I like to -"
"And what did you say?" said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was
grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking
at Hermione.
"And he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else," Hermione
went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from
her, "but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn't there ... or was
she? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the
grounds to watch the second task. ..."
"And what did you say?" Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it
dented the desk.
"Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to-“
"Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is. Miss Granger," said an icy
voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, "I must ask you not to
discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor."
Snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The whole class
was now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash
POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry.
"Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?" Snape added, snatching up
the copy of Witch Weekly. "A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of
course ..." Snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter's article.
"Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . ."
The dungeon rang with the Slytherins' laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled
Snape's thin mouth. To Harry's fury, he began to read the article aloud.
"'Harry Potter's Secret Heartache. . . dear, dear. Potter, what's ailing you
now? 'A boy like no other, perhaps. . .'"
Harry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every
sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times
worse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now.
"'. . . Harry Potter's well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his
heart upon a worthier candidate.' How very touching," sneered Snape, rolling
up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. "Well, I
think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your
potions rather than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss
Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter - that table in front of my
desk. Move. Now."
Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged
it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at
his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at
Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to
have Snape's face.
"All this press attention seems to have inflated your already over-large head.
Potter," said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again.
Harry didn't answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done
this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points
from Gryffindor before the end of the class.
"You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is
impressed with you," Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him
(Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already
reduced them to a very fine powder), "but I don't care how many times your
picture appears in the papers. To me. Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little
boy who considers rules to be beneath him."
Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his
ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes
down, as though he couldn't hear what Snape was saying to him.
"So I give you fair warning, Potter," Snape continued in a sorter and more
dangerous voice, "pint-sized celebrity or not - if I catch you breaking into my
office one more time -"
"I haven't been anywhere near your office!" said Harry angrily, forgetting his
feigned deafness.
"Don't lie to me," Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harrys.
"Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I know
who stole them."
Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In truth,
he hadn't stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the
boomslang skin back in their second year - they had needed it for the Polyjuice
Potion - and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been
able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed.
"I don't know what you're talking about," Harry lied coldly.
"You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!" Snape hissed.
"I know it. Potter! Now, Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but
I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office,
Potter, and you will pay!"
"Right," said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. "I'll bear that in
mind if I ever get the urge to go in there."
Snape's eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For
one wild moment. Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and
curse him - then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a
completely clear potion. Harry stared at it.
"Do you know what this is. Potter?" Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously
again.
"No," said Harry, with complete honesty this time.
"It is Veritaserum - a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you
spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear," said Snape
viciously. "Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry
guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand
slips" - he shook the crystal bottle slightly - "right over your evening pumpkin
juice. And then. Potter . . . then we'll find out whether you've been in my office
or not."
Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up
his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn't like the sound of that Truth
Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a
shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape
did it... quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble - Hermione and
Dobby for a start - there were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the
fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . and - his insides squirmed at the
thought - how he felt about Cho. ... He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron
too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody s book and
start drinking only from a private hip flask.
There was a knock on the dungeon door.
"Enter," said Snape in his usual voice.
The class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in.
Everyone watched him as he walked up toward Snape's desk. He was twisting
his finger around his goatee and looking agitated.
"We need to talk," said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. He
seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was
barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist.
Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard.
"I'll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff," Snape muttered, but Karkaroff
interrupted him.
"I want to talk now, while you can't slip off, Severus. You've been avoiding
me."
"After the lesson," Snape snapped.
Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he'd poured out
enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them.
Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry.
Karkaroff hovered behind Snape's desk for the rest of the double period. He
seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen
to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his
bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an
excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class
moved noisily toward the door.
"What's so urgent?" he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.
"This," said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw
Karkaroff pull up the left-hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on
his inner forearm.
"Well?" said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. "Do you
see? It's never been this clear, never since - "
"Put it away!" snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom.
"But you must have noticed -" Karkaroff began in an agitated voice.
"We can talk later, Karkaroff!" spat Snape. "Potter! What are you doing?"
"Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor," said Harry innocently, straightening
up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding.
Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked both
worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry
Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top
speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed.
They left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down
upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the
time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and
thrown them over their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in
Harry's bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask
of pumpkin juice from the lunch table.
They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they
had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned
with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they
became too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High
Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village.
Harry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading
them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were
fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the
mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw
a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost
bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers
in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . .
"Hello, Sirius," said Harry when they had reached him.
The black dog sniffed Harry's bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and
began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to
meet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over
the stile and followed.
Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered
with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but Harry,
Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up
onto the mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding,
and stony path, following Sirius's wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder
straps of Harry's bag cutting into his shoulders.
Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where
he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it
and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one
end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray
horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak's fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of
them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione
to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at
the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather.
Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when
he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had
appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked very
thin.
"Chicken!" he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his
mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor.
Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and
bread.
"Thanks," said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the
cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. "I've been living off rats
mostly. Can't steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I'd draw attention to
myself."
He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly.
"What're you doing here, Sirius?" he said.
"Fulfilling my duty as godfather," said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a
very doglike way. "Don't worry about it, I'm pretending to be a lovable stray."
He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harrys face, said more seriously,
"I want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let's just say things are
getting fishier. I've been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out,
and by the looks of things, I'm not the only one who's getting worried."
He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron picked
them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius.
"What if they catch you? What if you're seen?"
"You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I'm an
Animagus," said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg.
Ron nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets. There were two: The
first bore the headline Mystery Illness ofBartemius Crouch, the second,
Ministry Witch Still Missing-Minister of Magic Now Personally Involved.
Harry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases jumped out at him: hasn't been
seen in public since November. . . house appears deserted. . . St. Mungo's
Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment. . . Ministry
refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness. . . .
"They're making it sound like he's dying," said Harry slowly. "But he can't be
that ill if he managed to get up here. . . ."
"My brothers Crouch's personal assistant," Ron informed Sirius. "He says
Crouch is suffering from overwork."
"Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close," said Harry slowly,
still reading the story. "The night my name came out of the goblet. ..."
"Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn't he?" said Hermione,
an edge to her voice. She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up
Sirius's chicken bones. "I bet he wishes he hadn't done it now - bet he feels the
difference now she's not there to look after him."
"Hermione's obsessed with house-elfs," Ron muttered to Sirius, casting
Hermione a dark look. Sirius, however, looked interested.
"Crouch sacked his house-elf?"
"Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup," said Harry, and he launched into the story
of the Dark Mark's appearance, and Winky being found with Harrys wand
clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch's fury. When Harry had finished, Sirius
was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave.
"Let me get this straight," he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg.
"You first saw the elfin the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?"
"Right," said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.
"But Crouch didn't turn up for the match?"
"No," said Harry. "I think he said he'd been too busy."
Sirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, "Harry, did you check
your pockets for your wand after you'd left the Top Box?"
"Erm . . ." Harry thought hard. "No," he said finally. "I didn't need to use it
before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that
was in there were my Omnioculars." He stared at Sirius. "Are you saying
whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?"
"It's possible," said Sirius.
"Winky didn't steal that wand!" Hermione insisted.
"The elf wasn't the only one in that box," said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he
continued to pace. "Who else was sitting behind you?"
"Loads of people," said Harry. "Some Bulgarian ministers .. . Cornelius Fudge
... the Malfoys ..."
"The Malfoys!" said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around
the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. "I bet it was Lucius
Malfoy!"
"Anyone else?" said Sirius.
"No one," said Harry.
"Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman," Hermione reminded him.
"Oh yeah . . ."
"I don't know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the
Wimbourne Wasps," said Sirius, still pacing. "What's he like?"
"He's okay," said Harry. "He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard
Tournament."
"Does he, now?" said Sirius, frowning more deeply. "I wonder why he'd do
that?"
"Says he's taken a liking to me," said Harry.
"Hmm," said Sirius, looking thoughtful.
"We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared," Hermione told
Sirius. "Remember?" she said to Harry and Ron.
"Yeah, but he didn't stay in the forest, did he?" said Ron. "The moment we told
him about the riot, he went off to the campsite."
"How d'you know?" Hermione shot back. "How d'you know where he
Disapparated to?"
"Come off it," said Ron incredulously. "Are you saying you reckon Ludo
Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?"
"It's more likely he did it than Winky," said Hermione stubbornly.
"Told you," said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, "told you she's obsessed
with house -"
But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron.
"When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered
holding Harry's wand, what did Crouch do?"
"Went to look in the bushes," said Harry, "but there wasn't anyone else there."
"Of course," Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, "of course, he'd want to pin
it on anyone but his own elf... and then he sacked her?"
"Yes," said Hermione in a heated voice, "he sacked her, just because she hadn't
stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled -"
"Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!" said Ron.
Sirius shook his head and said, "She's got the measure of Crouch better than
you have, Ron. If you want to know what a mans like, take a good look at how
he treats his inferiors, not his equals."
He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard.
"All these absences of Barty Crouch's ... he goes to the trouble of making sure
his house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn't bother to
turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament,
and then stops coming to that too. . . . It's not like Crouch. If he's ever taken a
day off work because of illness before this, I'll eat Buckbeak."
"D'you know Crouch, then?" said Harry.
Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night
when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a
murderer.
"Oh I know Crouch all right," he said quietly. "He was the one who gave the
order for me to be sent to Azkaban - without a trial."
"What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
"You're kidding!" said Harry.
"No, I'm not," said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. "Crouch used to
be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn't you know?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads.
"He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic," said Sirius. "He's a great
wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical - and power-hungry. Oh never a
Voldemort supporter," he said, reading the look on Harrys face. "No, Barty
Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of
people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn't understand . . .
you're too young. ..."
"That's what my dad said at the World Cup," said Ron, with a trace of irritation
in his voice. "Try us, why don't you?"
A grin flashed across Sirius's thin face.
"All right, I'll try you. . . ." He walked once up the cave, back again, and then
said, "Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now. You don't know who his
supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know
he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop
themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends.
Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing .
. . the Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying
to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are
dying too. Terror everywhere . . . panic . . . confusion . . . that's how it used to
be.
"Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others.
Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning - I wouldn't know. He
rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures
against Voldemorts supporters. The Aurors were given new powers - powers to
kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was
handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with
violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I
would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had
his supporters, mind you - plenty of people thought he was going about things
the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to
take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like
only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather
unfortunate happened. ..." Sirius smiled grimly. "Crouch's own son was caught
with a group of Death Eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of Azkaban.
Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power."
"Crouch's son was caught?" gasped Hermione.
"Yep," said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself
back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. "Nasty
little shock for old Barty, I'd imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at
home with his family, shouldn't he? Ought to have left the office early once in a
while . . . gotten to know his own son."
He began to wolf down large pieces of bread.
"Was his son a Death Eater?" said Harry.
"No idea," said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. "I was in Azkaban myself
when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I've found out since I got out. The
boy was definitely caught in the company of people I'd bet my life were Death
Eaters - but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like
the house-elf."
"Did Crouch try and get his son off?" Hermione whispered.
Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.
"Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione!
Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated
his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted
house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again - doesn't that
tell you what he's like? Crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to
give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for
Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to
Azkaban."
"He gave his own son to the dementors?" asked Harry quietly.
"That's right," said Sirius, and he didn't look remotely amused now. "I saw the
dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He
can't have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near mine. He
was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days,
though . . .they all went quiet in the end. . . except when they shrieked in their
sleep. ..."
For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius's eyes became more pronounced than
ever, as though shutters had closed behind them.
"So he's still in Azkaban?" Harry said.
"No," said Sirius dully. "No, he's not in there anymore. He died about a year
after they brought him in."
"He died?”
"He wasn't the only one," said Sirius bitterly. "Most go mad in there, and plenty
stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a
death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That
boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry
member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I
saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself,
apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the boy. Crouch
never came for his sons body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I
watched them do it."
Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked
up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it.
"So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made," he continued,
wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. "One moment, a hero, poised to
become Minister of his son dead, his wife dead, the family name
dishonored, and, so I've heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once
the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son
and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly
astray. The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. So
Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the
Department of International Magical Cooperation."
There was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch's eyes had
bulged as he'd looked down at his disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the
Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted
to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories
of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry.
"Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards," Harry told
Sirius.
"Yeah, I've heard it's become a bit of a mania with him," said Sirius, nodding.
"If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching
one more Death Eater."
"And he sneaked up here to search Snape's office!" s aid Ron triumphantly,
looking at Hermione.
"Yes, and that doesn't make sense at all," said Sirius.
"Yeah, it does!" said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head.
"Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn't he been coming to
judge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to
Hogwarts and keep an eye on him."
"So you think Snape could be up to something, then?" asked Harry, but
Hermione broke in.
"Look, I don't care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape -"
"Oh give it a rest, Hermione," said Ron impatiently. "I know Dumbledores
brilliant and everything, but that doesn't mean a really clever Dark wizard
couldn't fool him -"
"Why did Snape save Harry's life in the first year, then? Why didn't he just let
him die?"
"I dunno - maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out-"
"What d'you think, Sirius?" Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped
bickering to listen.
"I think they've both got a point," said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and
Hermione. "Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I've wondered why
Dumbledore hired him. Snape's always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he
was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was," Sirius
added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. "Snape knew more curses
when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of
a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters."
Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names.
"Rosier and Wilkes - they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort
fell. The Lestranges - they're a married couple - they're in Azkaban. Avery -
from what I've heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he'd been
acting under the Imperius Curse - he's still at large. But as far as I know, Snape
was never even accused of being a Death Eater - not that that means much.
Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape s certainly clever and cunning
enough to keep himself out of trouble."
"Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet," said Ron.
"Yeah, you should've seen Snape's face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions
yesterday!" said Harry quickly. "Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says
Snape's been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape
something on his arm, but I couldn't see what it was."
He showed Snape something on his arm?" said Sirius, looking frankly
bewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then
shrugged again. "Well, I've no idea what that's about. . . but if Karkaroff s
genuinely worried, and he's going to Snape for answers ..."
Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration.
"There's still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore
trusts where a lot of other people wouldn't, but I just can't see him letting Snape
teach at Hogwarts if he'd ever worked for Voldemort."
"Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snapes office then?" said Ron
stubbornly.
"Well," said Sirius slowly, "I wouldn't put it past Mad-Eye to have searched
every single teacher's office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense
Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I'm not sure he trusts anyone at all,
and after the things he's seen, it's not surprising. I'll say this for Moody, though,
he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters.
Crouch, though . . . he's a different matter ... is he really ill? If he is, why did he
make the effort to drag himself up to Snape's office? And if he's not. . . what's
he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn't
turn up in the Top Box? What's he been doing while he should have been
judging the tournament?"
Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting
around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked.
Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron.
"You say your brother s Crouch's personal assistant? Any chance you could
ask him if he's seen Crouch lately?"
"I can try," said Ron doubtfully. "Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch
is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch."
"And you might try and find out whether they've got any leads on Bertha
Jorkins while you're at it," said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily
Prophet.
"Bagman told me they hadn't," said Harry.
"Yes, he's quoted in the article in there," said Sirius, nodding at the paper.
"Blustering on about how bad Bertha's memory is. Well, maybe she's changed
since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn't forgetful at all - quite the reverse.
She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get
her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see
her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that's why
Bagman didn't bother to look for her for so long. ..."
Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes.
"What's the time?"
Harry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn't been working since it had
spent over an hour in the lake.
"It's half past three," said Hermione.
"You'd better get back to school," Sirius said, getting to his feet. "Now listen . .
." He looked particularly hard at Harry. "I don't want you lot sneaking out of
school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about
anything odd. But you're not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it
would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you."
"No one's tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of
grindylows," Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him.
"I don't care . . . I'll breathe freely again when this tournament's over, and that's
not until June. And don't forget, if you're talking about me among yourselves,
call me Snuffles, okay?"
He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak goodbye. "I'll walk to the edge of the village with you," said Sirius, "see if I can
scrounge another paper."
He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they
walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn
ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the
head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.
"Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?" Ron said as they walked
up the drive to the castle. "But maybe he doesn't care . . . It'd probably just
make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He'd just say
Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son."
"Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors," said Hermione
severely.
"I don't know," said Ron. "If he thought we were standing in the way of his
career .. . Percy's really ambitious, you know. ..."
They walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious
smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall.
"Poor old Snuffles," said Ron, breathing deeply. "He must really like you.
Harry. . . . Imagine having to live off rats."
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT – THE MADNESS OF MR CROUCH
Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery after breakfast on Sunday to
send a letter to Percy, asking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen Mr.
Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had been so long since she'd had a
job. When they had watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery window,
they proceeded down to the kitchen to give Dobby his new socks.
The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying and
bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present.
"Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!" he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his
enormous eyes.
"You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did," said Harry.
"No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?" said Ron, who was looking
around at the beaming and bowing house-elves.
"You've just had breakfast!" said Hermione irritably, but a great silver platter of
eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves.
"We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles," Harry muttered.
"Good idea," said Ron. "Give Pig something to do. You couldn't give us a bit of
extra food, could you?" he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed
delightedly and hurried off to get some more.
"Dobby, where's Winky?" said Hermione, who was looking around.
"Winky is over there by the fire, miss," said Dobby quietly, his ears drooping
slightly.
"Oh dear," said Hermione as she spotted Winky.
Harry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same stool as
last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not
immediately distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her
clothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer
and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fire. As they watched her, she
gave an enormous hiccup.
"Winky is getting through six bottles a day now," Dobby whispered to Harry.
"Well, it's not strong, that stuff," Harry said.
But Dobby shook his head. "'Tis strong for a house-elf, sir," he said.
Winky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her
disapproving looks as they returned to work.
"Winky is pining, Harry Potter," Dobby whispered sadly. "Winky wants to go
home. Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby says
will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now."
"Hey, Winky," said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her,
and bending down, "you don't know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do you?
Because he's stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament."
Winky's eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry. She swayed
slightly again and then said, "M - Master is stopped - hic - coming?"
"Yeah," said Harry, "we haven't seen him since the first task. The Daily
Prophet's saying he's ill."
Winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.
"Master- hic- ill?"
Her bottom lip began to tremble.
"But we're not sure if that's true," said Hermione quickly.
"Master is needing his - hie - Winky!" whimpered the elf. "Master cannot - hic
- manage - hic - all by himself. . . ."
"Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky,"
Hermione said severely.
"Winky - hic - is not only - hic - doing housework for Mr. Crouch!" Winky
squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down
her already heavily stained blouse. "Master is - hic - trusting Winky with - hic
- the most important - hic - the most
"What?" said Harry.
But Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down herself.
"Winky keeps - hic - her master's secrets," she said mutinously, swaying very
heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed. "You is - hic -
nosing, you is."
"Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!" said Dobby angrily. "Harry
Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy!"
"He is nosing - hic - into my master's - hic - private and secret - hic - Winky is a
good house-elf- hic - Winky keeps her silence - hic - people trying to – hic - pry
and poke - hic -"
Winky's eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool
into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away
across the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-elves came hurrying
forward, looking disgusted. One of them picked up the bottle; the others
covered Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly,
hiding her from view.
"We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!" squeaked a nearby elf, shaking
his head and looking very ashamed. "We is hoping you will not judge us all by
Winky, sirs and miss!"
"She's unhappy!" said Hermione, exasperated. "Why don't you try and cheer
her up instead of covering her up?"
"Begging your pardon, miss," said the house-elf, bowing deeply again, "but
house-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and
masters to be served."
"Oh for heavens sake!" Hermione cried. "Listen to me, all of you! You've got
just as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You've got the right to wages and
holidays and proper clothes, you don't have to do everything you're told - look
at Dobby!"
"Miss will please keep Dobby out of this," Dobby mumbled, looking scared.
The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the
kitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she were mad and
dangerous.
"We has your extra food!" squeaked an elf at Harry's elbow, and he shoved a
large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry's arms. "Good-bye!"
The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began
shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of
their backs.
"Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!" Dobby called miserably from the
hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.
"You couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?" said Ron angrily
as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. "They won't want us visiting
them now! We could've tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch!"
"Oh as if you care about that!" scoffed Hermione. "You only like coming down
here for the food!"
It was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron and
Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that
he took Sirius's food up to the Owlery that evening on his own.
Pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by
himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well. When
they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large package
between them. Harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at
the dark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the rippling sails of the
Durmstrang ship. An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from
Hagrids chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the Owlery, and out of
sight. Looking down, Harry saw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his
cabin. Harry wondered what he was doing; it looked as though he were making
a new vegetable patch. As he watched, Madame Maxime emerged from the
Beauxbatons carriage and walked over to Hagrid. She appeared to be trying to
engage him in conversation. Hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem
keen to prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime returned to the carriage
shortly afterward.
Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and Hermione
snarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging until the darkness
swallowed him and the owls around Harry began to awake, swooshing past him
into the night.
By breakfast the next day Ron's and Hermione's bad moods had burnt out, and
to Harrys relief, Ron's dark predictions that the house-elves would send
substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because Hermione had insulted
them proved false; the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.
When the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up eagerly; she seemed to be
expecting something.
"Percy won't've had time to answer yet," said Ron. "We only sent Hedwig
yesterday."
"No, it's not that," said Hermione. "I've taken out a subscription to the Daily
Prophet. I'm getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins."
"Good thinking!" said Harry, also looking up at the owls. "Hey, Hermione, I
think you're in luck -"
A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.
"It hasn't got a newspaper, though," she said, looking disappointed. "It's -"
But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely
followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.
"How many subscriptions did you take out?" said Harry, seizing Hermione's
goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were
jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first.
"What on earth - ?" Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl, opening
it, and starting to read. "Oh really!" she sputtered, going rather red.
"What's up?" said Ron.
"It,'s - oh how ridiculous -"
She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but
composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the Daily
Prophet.
YOU ARE A WICKED GIRL. HARRY POTTER DESERVES
BETTER. GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM MUGGLE.
"They're all like it!" said Hermione desperately, opening one letter after
another. "'Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you. . . .' 'You
deserve to be boiled in frog spawn. . . .' Ouch!"
She had opened the last envelope, and yellowish-green liquid smelling strongly
of petrol gushed over her hands, which began to erupt in large yellow boils.
"Undiluted bubotuber pus!" said Ron, picking up the envelope gingerly and
sniffing it.
"Ow!" said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off
her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful
sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves.
"You'd better get up to the hospital wing," said Harry as the owls around
Hermione took flight. "We'll tell Professor Sprout where you've gone. . . ."
"I warned her!" said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great Hall, cradling
her hands. "I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at this one ..." He
read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind: "I read In Witch Weekly
about how you are playing Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough
hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find
a big enough envelope.' Blimey, she'd better watch out for herself."
Hermione didn't turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse
for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle
descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy Parkinson was whispering and
giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry,
Pansy called, "Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so
upset at breakfast?"
Harry ignored her; he didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how
much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused.
Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was
waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet.
Harrys heart sank at the sight of the crates - surely not another skrewt hatching?
- but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of flurry black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously
flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled
at all the attention.
"These're nifflers," said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around. "Yeh find
'em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. . . . There yeh go, look."
One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy
Parkinson's watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backward.
"Useful little treasure detectors," said Hagrid happily. "Thought we'd have
some fun with 'em today. See over there?" He pointed at the large patch of
freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window.
"I've buried some gold coins. I've got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that
digs up most. Jus' take off all yer valuables, an' choose a niffler, an get ready
ter set 'em loose."
Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn't
work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he picked up a niffler. It
put its long snout in Harry's ear and sniffed enthusiastically. It was really quite
cuddly.
"Hang on," said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, "there's a spare niffler here
. . . who's missin? Where's Hermione?"
"She had to go to the hospital wing," said Ron.
"We'll explain later," Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was listening.
It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures. The
nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water, each
scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their
hands. Ron's was particularly efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.
"Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?" he asked excitedly as his niffler dived
back into the soil, splattering his robes.
"Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, Ron," said Hagrid, grinning. "They wreck
houses, nifflers. I reckon they've nearly got the lot, now," he added, pacing
around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive. "I on'y buried a
hundred coins. Oh there y'are, Hermione!"
Hermione was walking toward them across the lawn. Her hands were very
heavily bandaged and she looked miserable. Pansy Parkinson was watching her
beadily.
"Well, let's check how yeh've done!" said Hagrid. "Count yer coins! An' there's
no point tryin' ter steal any, Goyle," he added, his beetle-black eyes narrowed.
"It's leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few hours."
Goyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It turned out that Ron's
niffler had been most successful, so Hagrid gave him an enormous slab of
Honeydukes chocolate for a prize. The bell rang across the grounds for lunch;
the rest of the class set off back to the castle, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione
stayed behind to help Hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes. Harry noticed
Madame Maxime watching them out other carriage window.
"What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?" said Hagrid, looking concerned.
Hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning, and the
envelope full of bubotuber pus.
"Aaah, don worry," said Hagrid gendy, looking down at her. "I got some o'
those letters an all, after Rita Skeeter wrote abou me mum. ‘Yeh’re a monster
an yeh should be put down.' 'Yer mother killed innocent people an if you had
any decency you d jump in a lake.'"
"No!" said Hermione, looking shocked.
"Yeah," said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall. "They're
jus' nutters, Hermione. Don’ open 'em if yeh get any more. Chuck 'em straigh'
in the fire."
"You missed a really good lesson," Harry told Hermione as they headed back
toward the castle. "They're good, nifflers, aren't they, Ron?"
Ron, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him. He looked
thoroughly put out about something.
"What's the matter?" said Harry. "Wrong flavor?"
"No," said Ron shortly. "Why didn't you tell me about the gold?"
"What gold?" said Harry.
"The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup," said Ron. "The leprechaun
gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn't you tell me
it disappeared?"
Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking
about.
"Oh . . ." he said, the memory coming back to him at last. "I dunno ... I never
noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand, wasn't I?"
They climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the Great Hall for
lunch.
"Must be nice," Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving
themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings. "To have so much money you
don't notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing."
"Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!" s aid Harry impatiently. "We
all did, remember?"
"I didn't know leprechaun gold vanishes," Ron muttered. "I thought I was
paying you back. You shouldn't've given me that Chudley Cannon hat for
Christmas."
"Forget it, all right?" said Harry.
Ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it. Then he said, "I
hate being poor."
Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of them really knew what to
say.
"It's rubbish," said Ron, still glaring down at his potato. "I don't blame Fred and
George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a
niffler."
"Well, we know what to get you next Christmas," said Hermione brightly.
Then, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, "Come on, Ron, it could
be worse. At least your fingers aren't full of pus." Hermione was having a lot
of difficulty managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen.
"I hate that Skeeter woman!" she burst out savagely. "I'll get her back for this
if it's the last thing I do!"
Hate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week, and
although she followed Hagrid's advice and stopped opening it, several of her illwishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked
insults at her for the whole Hall to hear. Even those people who didn't read
Witch Weekly knew all about the supposed Harry-Krum-Hermione triangle
now. Harry was getting sick of telling people that Hermione wasn't his
girlfriend.
"It'll die down, though," he told Hermione, "if we just ignore it. ... People got
bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time
"I want to know how she's listening into private conversations when she's
supposed to be banned from the grounds!" said Hermione angrily.
Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask
Professor Moody something. The rest of the class was very eager to leave;
Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex-deflection that many of them
were nursing small injuries. Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, he had
to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class.
"Well, Rita's definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!" Hermione panted five
minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron in the entrance hall and pulling
Harrys hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her.
"Moody says he didn't see her anywhere near the judges' table at the second
task, or anywhere near the lake!"
"Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this?" said Ron.
"No!" said Hermione stubbornly. "I want to know how she heard me talking to
Viktor! And how she found out about Hagrids mum!"
"Maybe she had you bugged," said Harry.
"Bugged?" said Ron blankly. "What. . . put fleas on her or something?"
Harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment.
Ron was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them.
"Aren't you two ever going to read Hogwarts, A
"What's the point?" said Ron. "You know it by heart, we can just ask you."
"All those substitutes for magic Muggles use - electricity, computers, and radar,
and all those things - they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there's too much
magic in the air. No, Rita's using magic to eavesdrop, she must be. ... If I could
just find out what it is ... ooh, if it's illegal, I'll have her ..."
"Haven't we got enough to worry about?" Ron asked her. "Do we have to start
a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well?"
"I'm not asking you to help!" Hermione snapped. "I'll do it on my own!"
She marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance. Harry
was quite sure she was going to the library.
"What's the betting she comes back with a box of Hate Rita Skeeter badges?"
said Ron.
Hermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to help her pursue vengeance
against Rita Skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload
was mounting ever higher in the days before the Easter holidays. Harry frankly
marveled at the fact that Hermione could research magical methods of
eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do. He was working flat-
out just to get through all their homework, though he made a point of sending
regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for Sirius; after last
summer, Harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry. He
enclosed notes to Sirius, telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had
happened, and that they were still waiting for an answer from Percy.
Hedwig didn't return until the end of the Easter holidays. Percy's letter was
enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs. Weasley had sent. Both Harrys
and Ron's were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee.
Hermiones, however, was smaller than a chicken egg. Her face fell when she
saw it.
"Your mum doesn't read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron?" she
asked quietly.
"Yeah," said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee. "Gets it for the recipes."
Hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg.
"Don't you want to see what Percy's written?" Harry asked her hastily.
Percys letter was short and irritated.
As I am constantly telling the Daily Prophet, Mr. Crouch is taking a welldeserved break. He is sending in regular owls with instructions. No, I
haven't actually seen him, but I think I can be trusted to know my own
superior's handwriting. I have quite enough to do at the moment without
trying to quash these ridiculous rumors. Please don't bother me again
unless it's something important. Happy Easter.
The start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was
training hard for the last Quidditch match of the season. This year, however, it
was the third and final task in the Triwizard Tournament for which he needed to
prepare, but he still didn't know what he would have to do. Finally, in the last
week of May, Professor McGonagall held him back in Transfiguration.
"You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o'clock. Potter," she
told him. "Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task."
So at half past eight that night. Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor
Tower and went downstairs. As he crossed the entrance hall, Cedric came up
from the Hufflepuff common room.
"What d'you reckon it's going to be?" he asked Harry as they went together
down the stone steps, out into the cloudy night. "Fleur keeps going on about
underground tunnels; she reckons we've got to find treasure."
"That wouldn't be too bad," said Harry, thinking that he would simply ask
Hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him.
They walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch stadium, turned through a
gap in the stands, and walked out onto the field.
"What've they done to it?" Cedric said indignantly, stopping dead.
The Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat. It looked as though
somebody had been building long, low walls all over it that twisted and
crisscrossed in every direction.
"They're hedges!" said Harry, bending to examine the nearest one.
"Hello there!" called a cheery voice.
Ludo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field with Krum and Fleur.
Harry and Cedric made their way toward them, climbing over the hedges. Fleur
beamed at Harry as he came nearer. Her attitude toward him had changed
completely since he had saved her sister from the lake.
"Well, what d'you think?" said Bagman happily as Harry and Cedric climbed
over the last hedge. "Growing nicely, aren't they? Give them a month and
Hagrid'll have them twenty feet high. Don't worry," he added, grinning,
spotting the less-than-happy expressions on Harrys and Cedric's faces, "you'll
have your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is over! Now, I imagine
you can guess what we're making here?"
No one spoke for a moment. Then -
"Maze," grunted Krum.
"That's right!" said Bagman. "A maze. The third task's really very
straightforward. The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of the maze.
The first champion to touch it will receive full marks."
"We seemply 'ave to get through the maze?" said Fleur.
"There will be obstacles," said Bagman happily, bouncing on the balls of his
feet. "Hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . then there will be spells that
must be broken ... all that sort of thing, you know. Now, the champions who
are leading on points will get a head start into the maze." Bagman grinned at
Harry and Cedric. "Then Mr. Krum will enter . . . then Miss Delacour. But
you'll all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the
obstacles. Should be fun, eh?"
Harry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that Hagrid was likely to
provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all.
However, he nodded politely like the other champions.
"Very well. . . if you haven't got any questions, we'll go back up to the castle,
shall we, it's a bit chilly. ..."
Bagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their way out of the
growing maze. Harry had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to
help him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on the shoulder.
"Could I haff a vord?"
"Yeah, all right," said Harry, slightly surprised.
"Vill you valk vith me?"
"Okay," said Harry curiously.
Bagman looked slightly perturbed.
"I'll wait for you. Harry, shall I?"
"No, it's okay, Mr. Bagman," said Harry, suppressing a smile, "I think I can
find the castle on my own, thanks."
Harry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set a course for the
Durmstrang ship. Instead, he walked toward the forest.
"What're we going this way for?" said Harry as they passed Hagrid s cabin and
the illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.
"Don't vont to be overheard," said Krum shortly.
When at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the
Beauxbatons horses' paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned
to face Harry.
"I vant to know," he said, glowering, "vot there is between you and Hermyown-ninny."
Harry, who from Krum's secretive manner had expected something much more
serious than this, stared up at Krum in amazement.
"Nothing," he said. But Krum glowered at him, and Harry, somehow struck
anew by how tall Krum was, elaborated. "We're friends. She's not my
girlfriend and she never has been. It's just that Skeeter woman making things
up."
"Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often," said Krum, looking
suspiciously at Harry.
"Yeah," said Harry, "because were friends."
He couldn't quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor Krum,
the famous International Quidditch player. It was as though the eighteen-yearold Krum thought he. Harry, was an equal - a real rival -
"You haff never . . . you haff not..."
"No," said Harry very firmly.
Krum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a few seconds, then said,
"You fly very veil. I vos votching at the first task."
"Thanks," said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller
himself. "I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint, you
really -"
But something moved behind Krum in the trees, and Harry, who had some
experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed
Krum's arm and pulled him around.
"Vot is it?"
Harry shook his head, staring at the place where he'd seen movement. He
slipped his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand.
Suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak. For a moment, Harry
didn't recognize him . . . then he realized it was Mr. Crouch.
He looked as though he had been traveling for days. The knees of his robes
were ripped and bloody, his face scratched; he was unshaven and gray with
exhaustion. His neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim.
His strange appearance, however, was nothing to the way he was behaving.
Muttering and gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to be talking to someone that
he alone could see. He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen
once when out shopping with the Dursleys. That man too had been conversing
wildly with thin air; Aunt Petunia had seized Dudley's hand and pulled him
across the road to avoid him; Uncle Vernon had then treated the family to a long
rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants.
"Vosn't he a judge?" said Krum, staring at Mr. Crouch. "Isn't he vith your
Ministry?"
Harry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mr. Crouch,
who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby tree.
"... and when you've done that, Weatherby, send an owl to Dumbledore
confirming the number of Durmstrang students who will be attending the
tournament, Karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve. . . ."
"Mr. Crouch?" said Harry cautiously.
"... and then send another owl to Madame Maxime, because she might want to
up the number of students she's bringing, now Karkaroff's made it a round
dozen ... do that, Weatherby, will you? Will you? Will..."
Mr. Crouch's eyes were bulging. He stood staring at the tree, muttering
soundlessly at it. Then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees.
"Mr. Crouch?" Harry said loudly. "Are you all right?"
Crouch's eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked around at Krum, who had
followed him into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in alarm.
"Vot is wrong with him?"
"No idea," Harry muttered. "Listen, you'd better go and get someone -"
"Dumbledore!" gasped Mr. Crouch. He reached out and seized a handful of
Harrys robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes were staring over Harry's
head. "I need... see ... Dumbledore. ..."
"Okay," said Harry, "if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to the-"
"I've done . . . stupid . . . thing . . ." Mr. Crouch breathed. He looked utterly
mad. His eyes were rolling and bulging, and a trickle of spittle was sliding
down his chin. Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort.
"Must. . . tell. . . Dumbledore . . ."
"Get up, Mr. Crouch," said Harry loudly and clearly. "Get up, I'll take you to
Dumbledore!"
Mr, Crouch's eyes rolled forward onto Harry.
"Who ... you?" he whispered.
"I'm a student at the school," said Harry, looking around at Krum for some help,
but Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous.
"You're not... his?” whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.
"No," said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about.
"Dumbledore's?"
"That's right," said Harry.
Crouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen Crouch's grip on his robes,
but it was too powerful.
"Warn ... Dumbledore ..."
"I'll get Dumbledore if you let go of me," said Harry. "Just let go, Mr. Crouch,
and I'll get him.. . ."
"Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would like a cup of
tea. My wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight
with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge."
Crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed completely
unaware that Harry was there, which surprised Harry so much he didn't notice
that Crouch had released him.
"Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.S, most satisfactory, yes, thank
you, yes, very proud indeed. Now, if you could bring me that memo from the
Andorran Minister of Magic, I think I will have time to draft a response. ..."
"You stay here with him!" Harry said to Krum. "I'll get Dumbledore, I'll be
quicker, I know where his office is -"
"He is mad," said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was still
gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy.
"Just stay with him," said Harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to
trigger another abrupt change in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around the
knees and pulled Harry back to the ground.
"Don't. . . leave .. . me!" he whispered, his eyes bulging again. "I... escaped .. .
must warn . . . must tell... see Dumbledore . . . my fault... all my fault. . . Bertha
. . . dead ... all my fault. .. my son ... my fault... tell Dumbledore ... Harry Potter
... the Dark Lord . . . stronger . . . Harry Potter ..."
"I'll get Dumbledore if you let me go, Mr. Crouch!" said Harry. He looked
furiously around at Krum. "Help me, will you?"
Looking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved forward and squatted down next
to Mr. Crouch.
"Just keep him here," said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr. Crouch. "I'll be
back with Dumbledore."
"Hurry, von't you?" Krum called after him as Harry sprinted away from the
forest and up through the dark grounds. They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric,
and Fleur had disappeared. Harry tore up the stone steps, through the oak front
doors, and off up the marble staircase, toward the second floor.
Five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway
along an empty corridor.
"Sher - sherbet lemon!" he panted at it.
This was the password to the hidden staircase to Dumbledore's office - or at
least, it had been two years ago. The password had evidently changed,
however, for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside, but stood
frozen, glaring at Harry malevolently.
"Move!" Harry shouted at it. "C'mon!"
But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it; he knew
it was no good. He looked up and down the dark corridor. Perhaps
Dumbledore was in the staffroom? He started running as fast as he could
toward the staircase -
"POTTER!"
Harry skidded to a halt and looked around. Snape had just emerged from the
hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle. The wall was sliding shut behind
him even as he beckoned Harry back toward him.
"What are you doing here, Potter?"
"I need to see Professor Dumbledore!" said Harry, running back up the corridor
and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead. "It's Mr. Crouch . . . he's
just turned up ... he's in the forest... he's asking -"
"What is this rubbish?" said Snape, his black eyes glittering. "What are you
talking about?"
"Mr. Crouch!" Harry shouted. "From the Ministry! He's ill or something - he's
in the forest, he wants to see Dumbledore! Just give me the password up to -"
"The headmaster is busy. Potter," said Snape, his thin mouth curling into an
unpleasant smile.
"I've got to tell Dumbledore!" Harry yelled.
"Didn't you hear me. Potter?"
Harry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying himself, denying Harry the
thing he wanted when he was so panicky.
"Look," said Harry angrily, "Crouch isn't right - he's - he's out of his mind - he
says he wants to warn -"
The stone wall behind Snape slid open. Dumbledore was standing there,
wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression. "Is there a
problem?" he said, looking between Harry and Snape.
"Professor!" Harry said, sidestepping Snape before Snape could speak, "Mr.
Crouch is here - he's down in the forest, he wants to speak to you!"
Harry expected Dumbledore to ask questions, but to his relief, Dumbledore did
nothing of the sort.
"Lead the way," he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor behind
Harry, leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly.
"What did Mr. Crouch say. Harry?" said Dumbledore as they walked swiftly
down the marble staircase.
"Said he wants to warn you . . . said he's done something terrible ... he
mentioned his son . . . and Bertha Jorkins .. . and - and Voldemort. . . something
about Voldemort getting stronger. ..."
"Indeed," said Dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into
the pitch-darkness.
"He's not acting normally," Harry said, hurrying along beside Dumbledore.
"He doesn't seem to know where he is. He keeps talking like he thinks Percy
Weasley's there, and then he changes, and says he needs to see you. ... I left him
with Viktor Krum."
"You did?" said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to take longer strides still,
so that Harry was running to keep up. "Do you know if anybody else saw Mr.
Crouch?"
"No," said Harry. "Krum and I were talking, Mr. Bagman had just finished
telling us about the third task, we stayed behind, and then we saw Mr. Crouch
coming out of the forest -"
"Where are they?" said Dumbledore as the Beauxbatons carriage emerged from
the darkness.
"Over here," said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way
through the trees. He couldn't hear Crouch's voice anymore, but he knew where
he was going; it hadn't been much past the Beauxbatons carriage . . . somewhere
around here. . . .
"Viktor?" Harry shouted.
No one answered.
"They were here," Harry said to Dumbledore. "They were definitely
somewhere around here. ..."
"Lumos," Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and holding it up.
Its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the
ground. And then it fell upon a pair of feet.
Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was sprawled on the forest
floor. He seemed to be unconscious. There was no sign at all of Mr. Crouch.
Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids.
"Stunned," he said softly. His half-moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he
peered around at the surrounding trees.
"Should I go and get someone?" said Harry. "Madam Pomfrey?"
"No," said Dumbledore swiftly. "Stay here."
He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of Hagrid's cabin.
Harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees
like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again, pointed his wand
at him, and muttered, "Ennervate."
Krum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw Dumbledore, he tried
to sit up, but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still.
"He attacked me!" Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head. "The old
madman attacked me! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he
attacked from behind!"
"Lie still for a moment," Dumbledore said.
The sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid came panting into
sight with Fang at his heels. He was carrying his crossbow.
"Professor Dumbledore!" he said, his eyes widening. "Harry - what the - ?"
"Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff," said Dumbledore. "His
student has been attacked. When you've done that, kindly alert Professor
Moody -"
"No need, Dumbledore," said a wheezy growl. "I'm here."
Moody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff, his wand lit.
"Damn leg," he said furiously. "Would've been here quicker . . . what's
happened? Snape said something about Crouch -"
"Crouch?" said Hagrid blankly.
"Karkaroff, please, Hagrid!" said Dumbledore sharply.
"Oh yeah . .'. right y'are, Professor. . ." said Hagrid, and he turned and
disappeared into the dark trees, Fang trotting after him.
"I don't know where Barty Crouch is," Dumbledore told Moody, "but it is
essential that we find him."
"I'm onto it," growled Moody, and he pulled out his wand and limped off into
the forest.
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakable
sounds of Hagrid and Fang returning. Karkaroff was hurrying along behind
them. He was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked pale and agitated.
"What is this?" he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and Dumbledore and
Harry beside him. "What's going on?"
"I vos attacked!" said Krum, sitting up now and rubbing his head. "Mr. Crouch
or votever his name -"
"Crouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The Triwizard judge?"
"Igor," Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching his
furs around him, looking livid.
"Treachery!" he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. "It is a plot! You and your
Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses, Dumbledore! This
is not an equal competition! First you sneak Potter into the tournament, though
he is underage! Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion
out of action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and
you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international
wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences - here's what
I think of you!"
Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore's feet. In one swift movement,
Hagrid seized the front of Karkaroff's furs, lifted him into the air, and slammed
him against a nearby tree.
"Apologize!" Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath, Hagrid's massive
fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.
"Hagrid, no!" Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.
Hagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree, and Karkaroff slid all
the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots; a few twigs and
leaves showered down upon his head.
"Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid," said Dumbledore sharply.
Breathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look.
"Maybe I'd better stay here. Headmaster. . . ."
"You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid," Dumbledore repeated firmly.
"Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower. And Harry - I want you to stay there.
Anything you might want to do - any owls you might want to send - they can
wait until morning, do you understand me?"
"Er - yes," said Harry, staring at him. How had Dumbledore known that, at that
very moment, he had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius,
to tell him what had happened?
"I'll leave Fang with yeh. Headmaster," Hagrid said, staring menacingly at
Karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and tree
roots. "Stay, Fang. C'mon, Harry."
They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward the
castle.
"How dare he," Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake. "How dare he
accuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore'd do anythin' like that. Like
Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs' place. Worried! I dunno
when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he's bin lately. An' you!" Hagrid
suddenly said angrily to Harry, who looked up at him, taken aback. "What
were yeh doin', wanderin' off with ruddy Krum? He's from Durmstrang, Harry!
Coulda jinxed yeh right there, couldn he? Hasn’ Moody taught yeh nothin'?
'Magine lettin him lure yeh off on yer own -"
"Krum's all right!" said Harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall.
"He wasn't trying to jinx me, he just wanted to talk about Hermione -"
"I'll be havin' a few words with her, an' all," said Hagrid grimly, stomping up
the stairs. "The less you lot 'ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh'll
be. Yeh can trust any of 'em."
"You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime," Harry said, annoyed.
"Don' you talk ter me abou' her!" said Hagrid, and he looked quite frightening
for a moment. "I've got her number now! Tryin' ter get back in me good books,
tryin' ter get me ter tell her what's comin in the third task. Ha! You can' trust
any of'em!"
Hagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good-bye to him in
front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through the portrait hole into the common
room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting,
to tell them what had happened.
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE – THE DREAM
It comes down to this," said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. "Either Mr.
Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor
wasn't looking."
"It must've been Crouch," said Ron at once. "That's why he was gone when
Harry and Dumbledore got there. He'd done a runner."
"I don't think so," said Harry, shaking his head. "He seemed really weak - I
don't reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything."
"You cant Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven't I told you enough
times?" said Hermione.
"Okay. . . hows this for a theory," said Ron excitedly. "Krum attacked Crouch -
no, wait for it - and then Stunned himself!"
"And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?" said Hermione coldly.
"Oh yeah . . ."
It was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories
very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now
they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were
puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr.
Crouch.
"Just go through it again, Harry," said Hermione. "What did Mr. Crouch
actually say?"
"I've told you, he wasn't making much sense," said Harry. "He said he wanted
to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins,
and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He
mentioned his son."
"Well, that was his fault," said Hermione testily.
"He was out of his mind," said Harry. "Half the time he seemed to think his
wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and
giving him instructions."
"And . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?" said Ron
tentatively.
"I've told you," Harry repeated dully. "He said he's getting stronger."
There was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, "But he was out
of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. ..."
"He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort," said Harry, and
Ron winced at the sound of the name. "He was having real trouble stringing
two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and
know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore."
Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The many
perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in
through one of the windows, returning from its night's hunting with a mouse in
its beak.
"If Snape hadn't held me up," Harry said bitterly, "we might've got there in time.
'The headmaster is busy. Potter . . . what's this rubbish, Potter?' Why couldn't
he have just got out of the way?"
"Maybe he didn't want you to get there!" said Ron quickly. "Maybe - hang on -
how fast d'you reckon he could've gotten down to the forest? D'you reckon he
could've beaten you and Dumbledore there?"
"Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something," said Harry.
"Wouldn't put it past him," Ron muttered.
"We need to see Professor Moody," said Hermione. "We need to find out
whether he found Mr. Crouch,"
"If he had the Marauder's Map on him, it would've been easy," said Harry.
"Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds," said Ron, "because it only
shows up to the boundaries, doesn't -"
"Shh!" said Hermione suddenly.
Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two
voices arguing, coming closer and closer.
"- that's blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that-"
"- we've tried being polite; it's time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn't like the
Ministry of Magic knowing what he did -"
"I'm telling you, if you put that in writing, it's blackmail!"
"Yeah, and you won't be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?"
The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then
froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
"What're you doing here?" Ron and Fred said at the same time.
"Sending a letter," said Harry and George in unison.
"What, at this time?" said Hermione and Fred.
Fred grinned.
"Fine - we won't ask you what you're doing, if you don't ask us," he said.
He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it, but Fred,
whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was
covered.
"Well, don't let us hold you up," Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at
the door.
Ron didn't move. "Who're you blackmailing?" he said.
The grin vanished from Fred's face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred,
before smiling at Ron.
"Don't be stupid, I was only joking," he said easily.
"Didn't sound like that," said Ron.
Fred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, "I've told you
before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can't see why you
would, but -"
"It's my business if you're blackmailing someone," said Ron. "George's right,
you could end up in serious trouble for that."
"Told you, I was joking," said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the
letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl.
"You're starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry
on like this and you'll be made a prefect."
"No, I won't!" said Ron hotly.
George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George turned
around and grinned at Ron.
"Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later."
He and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another.
"You don't think they know something about all this, do you?" Hermione
whispered. "About Crouch and everything?"
"No," said Harry. "If it was something that serious, they'd tell someone. They'd
tell Dumbledore."
Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable.
"What's the matter?" Hermione asked him.
"Well. . ." said Ron slowly, "I dunno if they would. They're . . . they're obsessed
with making money lately, I noticed it when I was hanging around with them -
when - you know -"
"We weren't talking." Harry finished the sentence for him. "Yeah, but
blackmail..."
"It's this joke shop idea they've got," said Ron. "I thought they were only saying
it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. They've only
got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it's time to think
about their future, and Dad can't help them, and they need gold to get started."
Hermione was looking uncomfortable now.
"Yes, but. . . they wouldn't do anything against the law to get gold."
"Wouldn't they?" said Ron, looking skeptical. "I dunno . . . they don't exactly
mind breaking rules, do they?"
"Yes, but this is the law" said Hermione, looking scared. "This isn't some silly
school rule. . . . They'll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron. . .
maybe you'd better tell Percy. . . ."
"Are you mad?" said Ron. "Tell Percy? He'd probably do a Crouch and turn
them in." He stared at the window through which Fred and George's owl had
departed, then said, "Come on, let's get some breakfast."
"D'you think it's too early to go and see Professor Moody?" Hermione said as
they went down the spiral staircase.
"Yes," said Harry. "He'd probably blast us through the door if we wake him at
the crack of dawn; he'll think we're trying to attack him while he's asleep. Let's
give it till break."
History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron's watch,
having finally discarded his own, but Ron's was moving so slowly he could
have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they
could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione
wasn't taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing
at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.
When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark
Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as
they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even
more lopsided appearance than usual.
"Professor Moody?" Harry called as they made their way toward him through
the crowd.
"Hello, Potter," growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing
first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody's
head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again.
"Come in here."
He stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and
closed the door.
"Did you find him?" Harry asked without preamble. "Mr. Crouch?"
"No," said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his
wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.
"Did you use the map?" Harry said.
"Of course," said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. "Took a leaf out of your
book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn't anywhere
on there."
"So he did Disapparate?" said Ron.
"You can't Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!" said Hermione. "There are
other ways he could have disappeared, aren't there, Professor?"
Moody's magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. "You're another one
who might think about a career as an Auror," he told her. "Mind works the
right way. Granger."
Hermione flushed pink with pleasure.
"Well, he wasn't invisible," said Harry. "The map shows invisible people. He
must've left the grounds, then."
"But under his own steam?" said Hermione eagerly, "or because someone made
him?"
"Yeah, someone could've - could've pulled him onto a broom and flown off with
him, couldn't they?" said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too
wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.
"We can't rule out kidnap," growled Moody.
"So," said Ron, "d'you reckon he's somewhere in Hogsmeade?"
"Could be anywhere," said Moody, shaking his head. "Only thing we know for
sure is that he's not here."
He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed
a number of missing teeth. Then he said, "Now, Dumbledore’s told me you
three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there's nothing you can do for
Crouch. The Ministry’ll be looking for him now, Dumbledore’s notified them.
Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task."
"What?" said Harry. "Oh yeah . . ."
He hadn't given the maze a single thought since he'd left it with Krum the
previous night.
"Should be right up your street, this one," said Moody, looking up at Harry and
scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. "From what Dumbledore’s said, you've
managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way through
a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerers Stone in your first year, didn't you?"
"We helped," Ron said quickly. "Me and Hermione helped."
Moody grinned.
"Well, help him practice for this one, and I'll be very surprised if he doesn't
win," said Moody. "In the meantime .. . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant
vigilance." He took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye
swiveled onto the window. The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible
through it.
"You two," counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, "you stick
close to Potter, all right? I'm keeping an eye on things, but all the same . . . you
can never have too many eyes out."
Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down beside Harry
at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione, clutching a
copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the newspaper, scanned the
first few pages, said, "Ha! She hasn't got wind of Crouch!" then joined Ron
and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the
night before last.
Harry - what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest with
Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to
go walking with anyone else at night. There is somebody highly dangerous
at Hogwarts. It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing
Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark. You
could have been killed.
Your name didn't get into the Goblet of Fire by accident. If someone's trying
to attack you, they're on their last chance. Stay close to Ron and Hermione,
do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third
task. Practice Stunning and Disarming. A few hexes wouldn't go amiss
either. There's nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your head down
and look after yourself. I'm waiting for your letter giving me your word you
won't stray out-of-bounds again.
Sirius
"Who's he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?" said Harry in mild
indignation as he folded up Sirius's letter and put it inside his robes. "After all
the stuff he did at school!"
"He's worried about you!" said Hermione sharply. "Just like Moody and
Hagrid! So listen to them!"
"No one's tried to attack me all year," said Harry. "No one's done anything to
me at
all-“
"Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire," said Hermione. "And they
must've done that for a reason. Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they've been
biding their time. Maybe this is the task they're going to get you."
"Look," said Harry impatiently, "let's say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned
Krum to kidnap Crouch. Well, they would've been in the trees near us,
wouldn't they? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted, didn't
they? So it doesn't look like I'm their target, does it?"
"They couldn't have made it look like an accident if they'd murdered you in the
forest!" said Hermione. "But if you die during a task-"
"They didn't care about attacking Krum, did they?" said Harry. "Why didn't
they just polish me off at the same time? They could've made it look like Krum
and I had a duel or something."
"Harry, I don't understand it either," said Hermione desperately. "I just know
there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don't like it. ... Moody’s right -
Sirius is right - you've got to get in training for the third task, straight away.
And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you're not going
to go sneaking off alone again."
The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to stay
indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library
with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which
they sneaked into to practice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell,
which he had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved
certain sacrifices on Ron's and Hermione's part.
"Can't we kidnap Mrs. Norris?" Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay
flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been
Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. "Let's Stun her for a
bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he'd do anything to help you. I'm not
complaining or anything" - he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside -
"but I'm aching all over. ..."
"Well, you keep missing the cushions, don't you!" said Hermione impatiently,
rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which
Flitwick had left in a cabinet. "Just try and fall backward!"
"Once you're Stunned, you can't aim too well, Hermione! "said Ron angrily.
"Why don't you take a turn?"
"Well, I think Harry's got it now, anyway," said Hermione hastily. "And we
don't have to worry about Disarming, because he's been able to do that for ages.
... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening."
She looked down the list they had made in the library.
"I like the look of this one," she said, "this Impediment Curse. Should slow
down anything that's trying to attack you. Harry. We'll start with that one."
The bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwicks cupboard
and slipped out of the classroom.
"See you at dinner!" said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while
Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of
dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows. The sky
outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled.
"It's going to be boiling in Trelawney's room, she never puts out that fire," said
Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor.
He was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The fumes from
the perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harrys head swam as he made his
way over to one of the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was
looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an
inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played
across his face. It was extremely comfortable.
"My dears," said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in
front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged
eyes, "we have almost finished our work on planetary divination. Today,
however, will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he
is placed most interestingly at the present time. If you will all look this way, I
will dim the lights. . . ."
She waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire was the only source of
light now. Professor Trelawney bent down and lifted, from under her chair, a
miniature model of the solar system, contained within a glass dome. It was a
beautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets
and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass. Harry
watched lazily as Professor Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle
Mars was making to Neptune. The heavily perfumed fumes washed over him,
and the breeze from the window played across his face. He could hear an insect
humming gently somewhere behind the curtain. His eyelids began to droop. . . .
He was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the clear blue sky
toward an old, ivy-covered house set high on a hillside. Lower and lower they
flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry's face, until they reached a dark and
broken window in the upper story of the house and entered. Now they were
flying along a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end . . . through the
door they went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded up....
Harry had left the owl's back... he was watching, now, as it fluttered across the
room, into a chair with its back to him. . . . There were two dark shapes on the
floor beside the chair . . . both of them were stirring. . . .
One was a huge snake . . . the other was a man ... a short, balding man, a man
with watery eyes and a pointed nose ... he was wheezing and sobbing on the
hearth rug. . . .
"You are in luck, Wormtail," said a cold, high-pitched voice from the depths of
the chair in which the owl had landed. "You are very fortunate indeed. Your
blunder has not ruined everything. He is dead."
"My Lord!" gasped the man on the floor. "My Lord, I am ... I am so pleased . . .
and so sorry. ..."
"Nagini," said the cold voice, "you are out of luck. I will not be feeding
Wormtail to you, after all... but never mind, never mind . . . there is still Harry
Potter. ..."
The snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering.
"Now, Wormtail," said the cold voice, "perhaps one more little reminder why I
will not tolerate another blunder from you. ..."
"My Lord ... no ... I beg you . . ."
The tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair. It was pointing at
Wormtail.
"Crucio!" said the cold voice.
Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire,
the screaming filled Harry's ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he
was yelling would hear him, would know he was there. . . .
"Harry! Harry!"
Harry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney's
room with his hands over his face. His scar was still burning so badly that his
eyes were watering. The pain had been real. The whole class was standing
around him, and Ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified.
"You all right?" he said.
"Of course he isn't!" said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited. Her
great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him. "What was it. Potter? A
premonition? An apparition? What did you see?"
"Nothing," Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shaking. He couldn't
stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemorts
voice had sounded so close. . . .
"You were clutching your scar!" said Professor Trelawney. "You were rolling
on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now. Potter, I have experience in these
matters!"
Harry looked up at her.
"I need to go to the hospital wing, I think," he said. "Bad headache."
"My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant
vibrations of my room!" said Professor Trelawney. "If you leave now, you
may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever -"
"I don't want to see anything except a headache cure," said Harry.
He stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved.
"See you later," Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed
for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression
of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.
When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off
for the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius
had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to
follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore's office. He marched
down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream . . . it had
been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive. . . . He ran over
the details in his mind, trying to make sure he could remember them. . . . He had
heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a blunder . . . but the owl had
brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead ... so
Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake . . . he, Harry, was going to be
fed to it instead. . . .
Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to
Dumbledores office without noticing. He blinked, looked around, realized what
he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it. Then he remembered
that he didn't know the password.
"Sherbet lemon?" he tried tentatively.
The gargoyle did not move.
"Okay," said Harry, staring at it, "Pear Drop. Er - Licorice Wand. Fizzing
Whizbee. Drooble's Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans ... oh
no, he doesn't like them, does he?... oh just open, can't you?" he said angrily. "I
really need to see him, its urgent!"
The gargoyle remained immovable.
Harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe.
"Chocolate Frog!" he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. "Sugar Quill!
Cockroach Cluster!"
The gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry blinked.
"Cockroach Cluster?" he said, amazed. "I was only joking. ..."
He hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral
stone staircase, which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him,
taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker.
He could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the moving staircase
and hesitated, listening.
"Dumbledore, I'm afraid I don't see the connection, don't see it at all!" It was
the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. "Ludo says Berthas
perfectly capable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have expected to
have found her by now, but all the same, we've no evidence of foul play,
Dumbledore, none at all. As for her disappearance being linked with Barty
Crouch's!"
"And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?" said Moody's
growling voice.
"I see two possibilities, Alastor," said Fudge. "Either Crouch has finally
cracked - more than likely, I'm sure you'll agree, given his personal history - lost
his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere -"
"He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius," said
Dumbledore calmly.
"Or else - well..." Fudge sounded embarrassed. "Well, I'll reserve judgment
until after I've seen the place where he was found, but you say it was just past
the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you know what that woman is?"
"I consider her to be a very able headmistress - and an excellent dancer," said
Dumbledore quietly.
"Dumbledore, come!" said Fudge angrily. "Don't you think you might be
prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid? They don't all turn out harmless - if,
indeed, you can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster fixation he's got -"
"I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid," said Dumbledore, just as
calmly. "I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced, Cornelius."
"Can we wrap up this discussion?" growled Moody.
"Yes, yes, let's go down to the grounds, then," said Fudge impatiently.
"No, it's not that," said Moody, "it's just that Potter wants a word with you,
Dumbledore. He's just outside the door."
CHAPTER THIRTY – THE PENSIEVE
The door of the office opened.
"Hello, Potter," said Moody. "Come in, then."
Harry walked inside. He had been inside Dumbledore's office once before; it
was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters
and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests
rising and falling gently.
Cornelius Fudge was standing beside Dumbledore's desk, wearing his usual
pinstriped cloak and holding his lime-green bowler hat.
"Harry!" said Fudge jovially, moving forward. "How are you?"
"Fine," Harry lied.
"We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the
grounds," said Fudge. "It was you who found him, was it not?"
"Yes," said Harry. Then, feeling it was pointless to pretend that he hadn't
overheard what they had been saying, he added, "I didn't see Madame Maxime
anywhere, though, and she'd have a job hiding, wouldn't she?"
Dumbledore smiled at Harry behind Fudge's back, his eyes twinkling.
"Yes, well," said Fudge, looking embarrassed, "we're about to go for a short
walk on the grounds, Harry, if you'll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to
your class -"
"I wanted to talk to you. Professor," Harry said quickly, looking at
Dumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look.
"Wait here for me, Harry," he said. "Our examination of the grounds will not
take long."
They trooped out in silence past him and closed the door. After a minute or so,
Harry heard the clunks of Moody's wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor
below. He looked around.
"Hello, Fawkes," he said.
Fawkes, Professor Dumbledore's phoenix, was standing on his golden perch
beside the door. The size of a swan, with magnificent scarlet-and-gold
plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at Harry.
Harry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore's desk. For several minutes,
he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their
frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his
scar. It had stopped hurting now.
He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore's office,
knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at
the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on
a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies
set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of
the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric
Gryffindor, founder of Harry's House. He was gazing at it, remembering how it
had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a
patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case. He looked
around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining
brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door had not been
closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across
the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.
A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes and
symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery light was coming from the
basin's contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He could
not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver,
and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked
like light made liquid - or like wind made solid - Harry couldn't make up his
mind.
He wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years'
experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full
of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He therefore pulled
his wand out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office,
looked back at the contents of the basin, and prodded them.
The surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.
Harry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery substance had
become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked down into it expecting to
see the stone bottom of the basin – and saw instead an enormous room below
the surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be
looking through a circular window in the ceiling.
The room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there
were no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated
the walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away
from the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards
were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels.
An empty chair stood in the very center of the room. There was something
about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms
of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.
Where was this place? It surely wasn't Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like
that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the
bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not
nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting
for something; even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their
faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to
one another.
The basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, Harry could
not make out what was going on in the corners of it. He leaned even closer,
tilting his head, trying to
The tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring.
Dumbledore's office gave an almighty lurch - Harry was thrown forward and
pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin -
But his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling through something
icy-cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool -
And suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room
inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others. He looked up at the high
stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he had just
been staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.
Breathing hard and fast. Harry looked around him. Not one of the witches and
wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundred of them) was looking
at him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen-year-old boy
had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard
next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated
around the silent room.
He was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.
"Professor!" Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper. "I'm sorry - I didn't
mean to - I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet - I - where are we?"
But Dumbledore didn't move or speak. He ignored Harry completely. Like
every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the
room, where there was a door.
Harry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then around at the silently watchful
crowd, then back at Dumbledore. And then it dawned on him. . . .
Once before. Harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear
him. That time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into
somebody else's memory . . . and unless he was very much mistaken, something
of the sort had happened
Harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in from of
Dumbledore's face. Dumbledore did not blink, look around at Harry, or indeed
move at all. And that, in Harry's opinion, settled the matter. Dumbledore
wouldn't ignore him like that. He was inside a memory, and this was not the
present-day Dumbledore. Yet it couldn't be that long ago . . . the Dumbledore
sitting next to him now was silver-haired, just like the present-day Dumbledore.
But what was this place? What were all these wizards waiting for?
Harry looked around more carefully. The room, as he had suspected when
observing it from above, was almost certainly underground - more of a dungeon
than a room, he thought. There was a bleak and forbidding air about the place;
there were no pictures on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows
of benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that they had a
clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms.
Before Harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were,
he heard footsteps. The door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three
people entered - or at least one man, flanked by two dementors.
Harry's insides went cold. The dementors - tall, hooded creatures whose faces
were concealed - were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room,
each grasping one of the man's arms with their dead and rotten-looking hands.
The man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and Harry
couldn't blame him ... he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a
memory, but he remembered their power only too well. The watching crowd
recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and
glided back out of the room. The door swung shut behind them.
Harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was
Karkaroff.
Unlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger; his hair and goatee were
black. He was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes. He was
shaking. Even as Harry watched, the chains on the arms of the chair glowed
suddenly gold and snaked their way up Karkaroff's arms, binding him there.
"Igor Karkaroff," said a curt voice to Harry's left. Harry looked around and
saw Mr. Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him. Crouch's
hair was dark, his face was much less lined, he looked fit and alert. "You have
been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic. You
have given us to understand that you have important information for us."
Karkaroff straightened himself as best he could, tightly bound to the chair.
"I have, sir," he said, and although his voice was very scared, Harry could still
hear the familiar unctuous note in it. "I wish to be of use to the Ministry. I wish
to help. I - I know that the Ministry is trying to - to round up the last of the Dark
Lords supporters. I am eager to assist in any way I can. ..."
There was a murmur around the benches. Some of the wizards and witches
were surveying Karkaroff with interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then
Harry heard, quite distinctly, from Dumbledores other side, a familiar, growling
voice saying, "Filth."
Harry leaned forward so that he could see past Dumbledore. Mad-Eye Moody
was sitting there - except that there was a very noticeable difference in his
appearance. He did not have his magical eye, but two normal ones. Both were
looking down upon Karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.
"Crouch is going to let him out," Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore. "He's
done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch is
going to let him go if he's got enough new names. Let's hear his information, I
say, and throw him straight back to the dementors."
Dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.
"Ah, I was forgetting . . . you don't like the dementors, do you, Albus?" said
Moody with a sardonic smile.
"No," said Dumbledore calmly, "I'm afraid I don't. I have long felt the Ministry
is wrong to ally itself with such creatures."
"But for filth like this . . ." Moody said softly.
"You say you have names for us, Karkaroff," said Mr. Crouch. "Let us hear
them, please."
"You must understand," said Karkaroff hurriedly, "that He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that we - I
mean to say, his supporters - and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever counted
myself among them -"
"Get on with it," sneered Moody.
"- we never knew the names of every one of our fellows - He alone knew
exactly who we all were -"
"Which was a wise move, wasn't it, as it prevented someone like you,
Karkaroff, from turning all of them in," muttered Moody.
"Yet you say you have some names for us?" said Mr. Crouch.
"I - I do," said Karkaroff breathlessly. "And these were important supporters,
mark you. People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding. I give this
information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a
remorse so deep I can barely -"
"These names are?" said Mr. Crouch sharply.
Karkaroff drew a deep breath.
"There was Antonin Dolohov," he said. "I - I saw him torture countless
Muggles and - and non-supporters of the Dark Lord."
"And helped him do it," murmured Moody.
"We have already apprehended Dolohov," said Crouch. "He was caught shortly
after yourself."
"Indeed?" said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. "I - I am delighted to hear it!"
But he didn't look it. Harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to
him. One of his names was worthless.
"Any others?" said Crouch coldly.
"Why, yes ... there was Rosier," said Karkaroff hurriedly. "Evan Rosier."
"Rosier is dead," said Crouch. "He was caught shortly after you were too. He
preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle."
"Took a bit of me with him, though," whispered Moody to Harry's right. Harry
looked around at him once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk out of
his nose to Dumbledore.
"No - no more than Rosier deserved!" said Karkaroff, a real note of panic in his
voice now. Harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his
information would be of any use to the Ministry. Karkaroff's eyes darted toward
the door in the corner, behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood,
waiting.
"Any more?" said Crouch.
"Yes!" said Karkaroff. "There was Travers - he helped murder the
McKinnons! Mulciber - he specialized in the Imperius Curse, forced countless
people to do horrific things! Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself!"
Harry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck gold. The watching crowd
was all murmuring together.
"Rookwood?" said Mr. Crouch, nodding to a witch sitting in front of him, who
began scribbling upon her piece of parchment. "Augustus Rookwood of the
Department of Mysteries?"
"The very same," said Karkaroff eagerly. "I believe he used a network of wellplaced wizards, both inside the Ministry and out, to collect information -"
"But Travers and Mulciber we have," said Mr. Crouch. "Very well, Karkaroff,
if that is all, you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide -"
"Not yet!" cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate. "Wait, I have more!"
Harry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his white skin contrasting
strongly with the black of his hair and beard.
"Snape!" he shouted. "Severus Snape!"
"Snape has been cleared by this council," said Crouch disdainfully. "He has
been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore."
"No!" shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound him to the chair. "I
assure you! Severus Snape is a Death Eater!"
Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.
"I have given evidence already on this matter," he said calmly. "Severus Snape
was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined our side before Lord
Voldemort's downfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk. He is now
no more a Death Eater than I am."
Harry turned to look at Mad-Eye Moody. He was wearing a look of deep
skepticism behind Dumbledore's back.
"Very well, Karkaroff," Crouch said coldly, "you have been of assistance. I
shall review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the meantime. ..."
Mr. Crouch's voice faded. Harry looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as
though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; he could see only his
own body - all else was swirling darkness. . . .
And then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in a different seat, still on
the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr. Crouch. The atmosphere
seemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful. The witches and wizards all
around the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at
some sort of sporting event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of
benches opposite. She had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and
was sucking the end of an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakably, a younger
Rita Skeeter. Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again,
wearing different robes. Mr. Crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer,
gaunter. . . . Harry understood. It was a different memory, a different day ... a
different trial.
The door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman walked into the room.
This was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed, but a Ludo Bagman who
was clearly at the height of his Quidditch-playing fitness. His nose wasn't
broken now; he was tall and lean and muscular. Bagman looked nervous as he
sat down in the chained chair, but it did not bind him there as it had bound
Karkaroff, and Bagman, perhaps taking heart from this, glanced around at the
watching crowd, waved at a couple of them, and managed a small smile.
"Ludo Bagman, you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical
Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters," said Mr.
Crouch. "We have heard the evidence against you, and are about to reach our
verdict. Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce
judgment?"
Harry couldn't believe his ears. Ludo Bagman, a Death Eater?
"Only," said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, "well - I know I've been a bit of an
idiot -"
One or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently.
Mr. Crouch did not appear to share their feelings. He was staring down at Ludo
Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike.
"You never spoke a truer word, boy," someone muttered dryly to Dumbledore
behind Harry. He looked around and saw Moody sitting there again. "If I
didn't know he'd always been dim, I'd have said some of those Bludgers had
permanently affected his brain. ..."
"Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort’s
supporters," said Mr. Crouch. "For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment in
Azkaban lasting no less than -"
But there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches. Several of the
witches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even
their fists, at Mr. Crouch.
"But I've told you, I had no idea!" Bagman called earnestly over the crowd's
babble, his round blue eyes widening. "None at all! Old Rookwood was a
friend of my dad's . . . never crossed my mind he was in with You-Know-Who!
I thought I was collecting information for our side! And Rookwood kept
talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on ... once my Quidditch
days are over, you know ... I mean, I can't keep getting hit by Bludgers for the
rest of my life, can I?"
There were titters from the crowd.
"It will be put to the vote," said Mr. Crouch coldly. He turned to the right-hand
side of the dungeon. "The jury will please raise their hands . . . those in favor of
imprisonment..."
Harry looked toward the right-hand side of the dungeon. Not one person raised
their hand. Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap.
One of the witches on the jury stood up.
"Yes?" barked Crouch.
"We'd just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for
England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday," the witch said
breathlessly.
Mr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing with applause now.
Bagman got to his feet and bowed, beaming.
"Despicable," Mr. Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting down as Bagman walked
out of the dungeon. "Rookwood get him a job indeed. . . . The day Ludo
Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry. . . ."
And the dungeon dissolved again. When it had returned, Harry looked around.
He and Dumbledore were still sitting beside Mr. Crouch, but the atmosphere
could not have been more different. There was total silence, broken only by the
dry sobs of a frail, wispy-looking witch in the seat next to Mr. Crouch. She was
clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands.
Harry looked up at Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever
before. A nerve was twitching in his temple.
"Bring them in," he said, and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon.
The door in the corner opened yet again. Six dementors entered this time,
flanking a group of four people. Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look
up at Mr. Crouch. A few of them whispered to one another.
The dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained
arms that now stood on the dungeon floor. There was a thickset man who
stared blankly up at Crouch; a thinner and more nervous-looking man, whose
eyes were darting around the crowd; a woman with thick, shining dark hair and
heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a
throne; and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of petrified. He
was shivering, his straw-colored hair all over his face, his freckled skin milkwhite. The wispy little witch beside Crouch began to rock backward and
forward in her seat, whimpering into her handkerchief.
Crouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in front of him, and there was
pure hatred in his face.
"You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law," he said
clearly, "so that we may pass judgment on you, for a crime so heinous -"
"Father," said the boy with the straw-colored hair. "Father. . .please . . .
"- that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court," said Crouch,
speaking more loudly, drowning out his son's voice.
"We have heard the evidence against you. The four of you stand accused of
capturing an Auror - Frank Longbottom - and subjecting him to the Cruciatus
Curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your
exiled master, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named -"
"Father, I didn't!" shrieked the boy in chains below. "I didn't, I swear it.
Father, don't send me back to the dementors -"
"You are further accused," bellowed Mr. Crouch, "of using the Cruciatus Curse
on Frank Longbottom's wife, when he would not give you information. You
planned to restore He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to power, and to resume the
lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury -"
"Mother!" screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch
began to sob, rocking backward and forward. "Mother, stop him. Mother, I
didn't do it, it wasn't me!"
"I now ask the jury," shouted Mr. Crouch, "to raise their hands if they believe,
as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!"
In unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of the dungeon
raised their hands. The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for
Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream.
"No! Mother, no! I didn't do it, I didn't do it, I didn't know! Don't send me
there, don't let him!"
The dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys' three companions
rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up
at Crouch and called, "The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into
Azkaban; we will wait! He
will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other
supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!"
But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see
their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering, some
of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy
continued to struggle.
"I'm your son!" he screamed up at Crouch. "I'm your son!"
"You are no son of mine!" bellowed Mr. Crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly. "I
have no son!"
The wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat. She had
fainted. Crouch appeared not to have noticed.
"Take them away!" Crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying from his mouth.
"Take them away, and may they rot there!"
"Father! Father, I wasn't involved! No! No! Father, please!"
"I think. Harry, it is time to return to my office," said a quiet voice in Harrys
ear.
Harry started. He looked around. Then he looked on his other side.
There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch's son
being dragged away by the dementors - and there was an Albus Dumbledore on
his left, looking right at him.
"Come," said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand under Harrys
elbow. Harry felt himself rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him;
for a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as though he had done a slowmotion somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like the
dazzling light of Dumbledore's sunlit office. The stone basin was shimmering
in the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him.
"Professor," Harry gasped, "I know I shouldn't've - I didn't mean - the cabinet
door was sort of open and -"
"I quite understand," said Dumbledore. He lifted the basin, carried it over to his
desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He
motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him.
Harry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their
original, silvery-white state, swirling and rippling beneath his gaze.
"What is it?" Harry asked shakily.
"This? It is called a Pensieve," said Dumbledore. "I sometimes find, and I am
sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories
crammed into my mind."
"Er," said Harry, who couldn't truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of
the sort.
"At these times," said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, "I use the
Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them
into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot
patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form."
"You mean . . . that stuff's your thoughts?” Harry said, staring at the swirling
white substance in the basin.
"Certainly," said Dumbledore. "Let me show you."
Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into
his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair
seemed to be clinging to it - but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening
strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve.
Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry, astonished, saw
his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl. Dumbledore placed his
long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold
prospector would pan for fragments of gold.... and Harry saw his own face
change smoothly into Snape's, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling,
his voice echoing slightly.
"It's coming back . . . Karkaroff's too . . . stronger and clearer than ever..."
"A connection I could have made without assistance," Dumbledore sighed, "but
never mind." He peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles at Harry, who
was gaping at Snape's face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl. "I
was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away
rather hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly.
Naturally, it would have attracted your attention."
"I'm sorry," Harry mumbled.
Dumbledore shook his head. "Curiosity is not a sin," he said. "But we should
exercise caution with our curiosity. . . yes, indeed ..."
Frowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his
wand. Instantly, a figure rose out of it, a plump, scowling girl of about sixteen,
who began to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin. She took no notice
whatsoever of Harry or Professor Dumbledore. When she spoke, her voice
echoed as Snape's had done, as though it were coming from the depths of the
stone basin. "He put a hex on me, Professor Dumbledore, and I
was only teasing him, sir, I only said I'd seen him kissing Florence behind the
greenhouses last Thursday. . . ."
"But why. Bertha," said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently
revolving girl, "why did you have to follow him in the first place?"
"Bertha?" Harry whispered, looking up at her. "Is that - was that Bertha
Jorkins?"
"Yes," said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again; Bertha sank
back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more. "That was
Bertha as I remember her at school."
The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated Dumbledore's face, and it struck
Harry suddenly how very old he was looking. He knew, of course, that
Dumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he never really thought of
Dumbledore as an old man.
"So, Harry," said Dumbledore quietly. "Before you got lost in my thoughts, you
wanted to tell me something."
"Yes," said Harry. "Professor - I was in Divination just now, and - er - I fell
asleep."
He hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore
merely said, "Quite understandable. Continue."
"Well, I had a dream," said Harry. "A dream about Lord Voldemort. He was
torturing Wormtail . . . you know who Wormtail-"
"I do know," said Dumbledore promptly. "Please continue."
"Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail's
blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said,
Wormtail wouldn't be fed to the snake - there was a snake beside his chair. He
said - he said he'd be feeding me to it,
instead. Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail - and my scar hurt,"
Harry said. "It woke me up, it hurt so badly."
Dumbledore merely looked at him.
"Er - that's all," said Harry.
"I see," said Dumbledore quietly. "I see. Now, has your scar hurt at any other
time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer?"
"No, I - how did you know it woke me up over the summer?" said Harry,
astonished.
"You are not Sirius's only correspondent," said Dumbledore. "I have also been
in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who
suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay."
Dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk. Every
now and then, he placed his wand tip to his temple, removed another shining
silver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The thoughts inside began to swirl
so fast that Harry couldn't make out anything clearly: It was merely a blur of
color.
"Professor?" he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.
"My apologies," he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.
"D'you - d'you know why my scar's hurting me?"
Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, "I have
a theory, no more than that. ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when
Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge
of hatred."
"But. . . why?"
"Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed," said Dumbledore.
"That is no ordinary scar."
"So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?"
"It is possible," said Dumbledore. "I would say - probable. Harry - did you see
Voldemort?"
"No," said Harry. "Just the back of his chair. But - there wouldn't have been
anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn't got a body, has he? But. . . but
then how could he have held the wand?" Harry said slowly.
"How indeed?" muttered Dumbledore. "How indeed . . ."
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledore was gazing
across the room, and, every now and then, placing his wand tip to his temple
and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the
Pensieve.
"Professor," Harry said at last, "do you think he's getting stronger?"
"Voldemort?" said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve. It was the
characteristic, piercing look Dumbledore had given him on other occasions,
and always made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were seeing right through
him in a way that even Moody's magical eye could not. "Once again. Harry, I
can only give you my suspicions."
Dumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and wearier, than ever.
"The years of Voldemort's ascent to power," he said, "were marked with
disappearances. Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where
Voldemort was certainly known to be last. Mr. Crouch too has disappeared . . .
within these very grounds. And there was a third disappearance, one which the
Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a
Muggle. His name was Frank Bryce, he lived in the village where Voldemort's
father grew up, and he has not been seen since last August. You see, I read the
Muggle newspapers, unlike most of my Ministry friends."
Dumbledore looked very seriously at Harry.
"These disappearances seem to me to be linked. The Ministry disagrees - as
you may have heard, while waiting outside my office."
Harry nodded. Silence fell between them again, Dumbledore extracting
thoughts every now and then. Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his
curiosity held him in his chair.
"Professor?" he said again.
"Yes, Harry?" said Dumbledore.
"Er . . . could I ask you about. . . that court thing I was in ... in the Pensieve?"
"You could," said Dumbledore heavily. "I attended it many times, but some
trials come back to me more clearly than others ... particularly now. ..."
"You know - you know the trial you found me in? The one with Crouch's son?
they talking about Neville's parents?"
Dumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. " Has Neville never told you why he
has been brought up by his grandmother?" he said.
Harry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to ask
Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him.
"Yes, they were talking about Nevilles parents," said Dumbledore. "His father,
Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured
for information about Voldemort's whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you
heard."
"So they're dead?" said Harry quietly.
"No," said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard
there before. "They are insane. They are both in St. Mungo's Hospital for
Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his
grandmother, during the holidays. They do not recognize him."
Harry sat there, horror-struck. He had never known . . . never, in four years,
bothered to find out. . .
"The Longbottoms were very popular," said Dumbledore. "The attacks on
them came after Voldemort's fall from power, just when everyone thought they
were safe. Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known.
The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it.
Unfortunately, the Longbottoms' evidence was - given their condition - none too
reliable."
"Then Mr. Crouch's son might not have been involved?" said Harry slowly.
Dumbledore shook his head.
"As to that, I have no idea."
Harry sat in silence once more, watching the contents of the Pensieve swirl.
There were two more questions he was burning to ask . . . but they concerned
the guilt of living people. . . .
"Er," he said, "Mr. Bagman . .."
"... has never been accused of any Dark activity since," said Dumbledore
calmly.
"Right," said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which
were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts.
"And ... er ..."
But the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him.
Snape's face was swimming on the surface again. Dumbledore glanced down
into it, and then up at Harry.
"No more has Professor Snape," he said.
Harry looked into Dumbledore's light blue eyes, and the thing he really wanted
to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it.
"What made you think he'd really stopped supporting Voldemort, Professor?"
Dumbledore held Harrys gaze for a few seconds, and then said, "That, Harry, is
a matter between Professor Snape and myself."
Harry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore did not look angry, yet
there was a finality in his tone that told Harry it was time to go. He stood up,
and so did Dumbledore.
"Harry," he said as Harry reached the door. "Please do not speak about
Neville's parents to anybody else. He has the right to let people know, when he
is ready."
"Yes, Professor," said Harry, turning to go.
"And-"
Harry looked back. Dumbledore was standing over the Pensieve, his face lit
from beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever. He stared at
Harry for a moment, and then said, "Good luck with the third task."
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE – THE THIRD TASK
Dumbledore reckons You-Know-Who's getting stronger again as well?" Ron
whispered.
Everything Harry had seen in the Pensieve, nearly everything Dumbledore had
told and shown him afterward, he had now shared with Ron and Hermione -
and, of course, with Sirius, to whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had
left Dumbledore's office. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common
room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry's mind was reeling,
until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full
of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.
Ron stared into the common room fire. Harry thought he saw Ron shiver
slightly, even though the evening was warm.
"And he trusts Snape?" Ron said. "He really trusts Snape, even though he
knows he was a Death Eater?"
"Yes," said Harry.
Hermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was sitting with her forehead in
her hands, staring at her knees. Harry thought she too looked as though she
could have done with a Pensieve.
"Rita Skeeter," she muttered finally.
"How can you be worrying about her now?" said Ron, in utter disbelief.
"I'm not worrying about her," Hermione said to her knees. "I'm just thinking. . .
remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks? 'I know things about
Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl. ' This is what she meant, isn't it?
She reported his trial, she knew he'd passed information to the Death Eaters.
And Winky too, remember . . .'Ludo Bagman's a bad wizard.' Mr. Crouch
would have been furious he got off, he would have talked about it at home."
"Yeah, but Bagman didn't pass information on purpose, did he?"
Hermione shrugged.
"And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?" Ron said, turning
back to Harry.
"Yeah," said Harry, "but he's only saying that because Crouch disappeared near
the Beauxbatons carriage."
"We never thought of her, did we?" said Ron slowly. "Mind you, she's
definitely got giant blood, and she doesn't want to admit it-"
"Of course she doesn't," said Hermione sharply, looking up. "Look what
happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother. Look at Fudge,
jumping to conclusions about her, just because she's part giant. Who needs that
sort of prejudice? I'd probably say I had big bones if I knew that's what I'd get
for telling the truth."
Hermione looked at her watch. "We haven't done any practicing!" she said,
looking shocked. "We were going to do the Impediment Curse! We'll have to
really get down to it tomorrow! Come on. Harry, you need to get some sleep."
Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. As Harry pulled on his
pajamas, he looked over at Nevilles bed. True to his word to Dumbledore, he
had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville s parents. As Harry took off his
glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have
parents still living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy from
strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Nevilles snores, he thought
that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a
rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs.
Longbottom. ... He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch's son and his
companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors. ... He understood how they had felt. . . . Then he remembered the milk-white face of the
screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later. . . .
It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the
darkness, it all came back to Voldemort. ... He was the one who had torn these
families apart, who had ruined all these lives. . . .
Ron and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which would
finish on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their efforts into
helping Harry prepare.
"Don't worry about it," Hermione said shortly when Harry pointed this out to
them and said he didn't mind practicing on his own for a while, "at least we'll
get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts. We'd never have found out
about all these hexes in class."
"Good training for when we're all Aurors," said Ron excitedly, attempting the
Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop
dead in midair.
The mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again.
Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week
before the end of term. Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment.
He felt more confident about this task than either of the others. Difficult and
dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had
managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before
now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what
lay ahead.
Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school. Professor
McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration
classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a
spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would
enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a
useful discovery of Hermiones that would make his wand point due north,
therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction
within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though.
This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that
deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed
Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward
before she had looked up the counter-jinx.
"You're still doing really well, though," Hermione said encouragingly, looking
down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned. "Some of
these are bound to come in handy."
"Come and look at this," said Ron, who was standing by the window. He was
staring down onto the grounds. "What's Malfoy doing?"
Harry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in
the shadow of a tree below. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout;
both were smirking. Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and
speaking into it.
"He looks like he's using a walkie-talkie," said Harry curiously.
"He can't be," said Hermione, "I've told you, those sorts of things don't work
around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry," she added briskly, turning away from the
window and moving back into the middle of the room, "let's try that Shield
Charm again."
Sirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he seemed to want to
concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned
themselves with anything else. He reminded Harry in every letter that whatever
might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry's responsibility,
nor was it within his power to influence it.
If Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to
ensure your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under
Dumbledore's protection, but all the same, take no risks: Concentrate on
getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other
matters.
Harry's nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth drew closer, but they were
not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. For one thing,
he was confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to prepare
for the task. For another, this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly
he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous
relief.
Breakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the
third task. The post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from
Sirius. It was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a muddy paw
print on its front, but Harry appreciated it all the same. A screech owl arrived
for Hermione, carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual. She
unfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of
pumpkin juice all over it.
"What?" said Harry and Ron together, staring at her. "Nothing," said Hermione
quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it. He stared at
the headline and said, "No way. Not today. That old cow."
"What?" said Harry. "Rita Skeeter again?"
"No," said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of
sight.
"It's about me, isn't it?" said Harry.
"No," said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone. But before Harry could
demand to see the paper. Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the
Slytherin table.
"Hey, Potter! Potter! How's your head? You feeling all right? Sure you're not
going to go berserk on us?"
Malfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too. Slytherins up and down
the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see Harry's reaction.
"Let me see it," Harry said to Ron. "Give it here."
Very reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper. Harry turned it over and
found himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headline:
“HARRY POTTER "DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS”
The boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is unstable and possibly
dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Alarming evidence
has recently come to light about Harry Potter's strange behavior, which casts
doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the
Triwizard Tournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School.
Potter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly collapses at school,
and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the
curse with which You-Know-Who attempted to kill him). On Monday last,
midway through a Divination lesson, your Daily Prophet reporter witnessed
Potter storming from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to
continue studying.
It is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and
Injuries, that Potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by
You-Know-Who, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an
expression of his deep-seated confusion.
"He might even be pretending," said one specialist. "This could be a plea for
attention."
The Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about Harry Potter
that Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from
the wizarding public.
"Potter can speak Parseltongue," reveals Draco Malfoy, a Hogwarts fourth year.
"There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people
thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling
club and set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he's
made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he'd do anything for a
bit of power."
Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a
Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than
You-Know-Who himself. A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who
wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could
speak Parseltongue "as worthy of investigation. Personally, I would be highly
suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often
used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with
evildoers." Similarly, "anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious
creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for
violence."
Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be
allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Some fear that Potter might
resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task
of which takes place this evening.
"Gone off me a bit, hasn't she?" said Harry lightly, folding up the paper.
Over at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were laughing at him,
tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and
waggling their tongues like snakes.
"How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?" Ron said. "There's no way
she was there, there's no way she could've heard -"
"The window was open," said Harry. "I opened it to breathe."
"You were at the top of North Tower!" Hermione said. "Your voice couldn't
have carried all the way down to the grounds!"
"Well, you're the one who's supposed to be researching magical methods of
bugging!" said Harry. "You tell me how she did it!"
"I've been trying!" said Hermione. "But I... but. . ."
An odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over Hermione's face. She slowly
raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair.
"Are you all right?" said Ron, frowning at her.
"Yes," said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers through her hair again,
and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible
walkie-talkie. Harry and Ron stared at each other.
"I've had an idea," Hermione said, gazing into space. "I think I know. . .
because then no one would be able to see ... even Moody. . . and she'd have been
able to get onto the window ledge . . . but she's not allowed . . . she's definitely
not allowed ... I think we've got her! Just give me two seconds in the library -
just to make sure!"
With that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall.
"Oi!" Ron called after her. "We've got our History of Magic exam in ten
minutes! Blimey," he said, turning back to Harry, "she must really hate that
Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam. What're you going to do in
Binns's class - read again?"
Exempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard champion, Harry had been
sitting in the back of every exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the
third task.
"S'pose so," Harry said to Ron; but just then. Professor McGonagall came
walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward him.
"Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after
breakfast," she said.
"But the task's not till tonight!" said Harry, accidentally spilling scrambled
eggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.
"I'm aware of that, Potter," she said. "The champions' families are invited to
watch the final task, you know. This is simply a chance for you to greet them."
She moved away. Harry gaped after her.
"She doesn't expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?" he asked Ron blankly.
"Dunno," said Ron. "Harry, I'd better hurry, I'm going to be late for Binns. See
you later."
Harry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall. He saw Fleur
Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the
side chamber and entered. Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward.
Harry stayed where he was. He really didn't want to go into the chamber. He
had no family - no family who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway.
But just as he was getting up, thinking that he might as well go up to the library
and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side chamber opened, and
Cedric stuck his head out.
"Harry, come on, they're waiting for you!"
Utterly perplexed. Harry got up. The Dursleys couldn't possibly be here, could
they? He walked across the Hall and opened the door into the chamber.
Cedric and his parents were just inside the door. Viktor Krum was over in a
corner, conversing with his dark-haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian.
He had inherited his fathers hooked nose. On the other side of the room, Fleur
was jabbering away in French to her mother. Fleur's little sister, Gabrielle, was
holding her mother's hand. She waved at Harry, who waved back, grinning.
Then he saw Mrs. Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming
at him.
"Surprise!" Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over
to them. "Thought we'd come and watch you. Harry!" She bent down and
kissed him on the cheek.
"You all right?" said Bill, grinning at Harry and shaking his hand. "Charlie
wanted to come, but he couldn't get time off. He said you were incredible
against the Horntail."
Fleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her
mother's shoulder. Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long
hair or earrings with fangs on them.
"This is really nice of you," Harry muttered to Mrs. Weasley. "I thought for a
moment - the Dursleys -"
"Hmm," said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips. She had always refrained from
criticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they
were mentioned.
"It's great being back here," said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the
Fat Lady's friend, winked at him from her frame). "Haven't seen this place for
five years. Is that picture of the mad knight still around? Sir Cadogan?"
"Oh yeah," said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year.
"And the Fat Lady?" said Bill.
"She was here in my time," said Mrs. Weasley. "She gave me such a telling off
one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning -"
"What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning?" said Bill,
surveying his mother with amazement.
Mrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.
"Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll," she said. "He got caught by
Apollyon Pringle - he was the caretaker in those days - your father's still got the
marks."
"Fancy giving us a tour, Harry?" said Bill.
"Yeah, okay," said Harry, and they made their way back toward the door into
the Great Hall. As they passed Amos Diggory, he looked around.
"There you are, are you?" he said, looking Harry up and down.
"Bet you're not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedrics caught you up on
points, are you?"
"What?" said Harry.
"Ignore him," said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father.
"He's been angry ever since Rita Skeeters article about the Triwizard
Tournament - you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts
champion."
"Didn't bother to correct her, though, did he?" said Amos Diggory, loudly
enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs.
Weasley and Bill. "Still, . . you'll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before,
haven't you?"
"Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!" Mrs. Weasley said
angrily. "I would have thought you'd know that, working at the Ministry!"
Mr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his
wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.
Harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with Bill
and Mrs. Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang
ship. Mrs. Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping Willow, which had been
planted after she had left school, and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper
before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.
"How's Percy?" Harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses.
"Not good," said Bill.
"He's very upset," said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her voice and glancing around.
"The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch's disappearance quiet, but Percy's been
hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending
in. They seem to think there's a chance they weren't genuinely written by him.
Percy's been under a lot of strain. They're not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch
as the fifth judge tonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it."
They returned to the castle for lunch.
"Mum - Bill!" said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the Gryffindor table.
"What're you doing here?"
"Come to watch Harry in the last task!" said Mrs. Weasley brightly. "I must
say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam?"
"Oh . . . okay," said Ron. "Couldn't remember all the goblin rebels' names, so I
invented a few. It's all right," he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty, while
Mrs. Weasley looked stern, "they're all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and
Urg the Unclean; it wasn't hard."
Fred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too, and Harry was having
such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the Burrow; he had
forgotten to worry about that evening's task, and not until Hermione turned up,
halfway through lunch, did he remember that she had had a brainwave about
Rita Skeeter.
"Are you going to tell us - ?"
Hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs. Weasley.
"Hello, Hermione," said Mrs. Weasley, much more stiffly than usual.
"Hello," said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs.
Weasley's face.
Harry looked between them, then said, "Mrs. Weasley, you didn't believe that
rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione's not
my girlfriend."
"Oh!" said Mrs. Weasley "No - of course I didn't!"
But she became considerably warmer toward Hermione after that.
Harry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk
around the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast.
Ludo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had joined the staff table now. Bagman
looked quite cheerful, but Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame
Maxime, looked stern and was not talking. Madame Maxime was concentrating
on her plate, and Harry thought her eyes looked red. Hagrid kept glancing along
the table at her,
There were more courses than usual, but Harry, who was starting to feel really
nervous now, didn't eat much. As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade
from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table, and
silence fell.
"Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes' time, I will be asking you to make your
way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard
Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the
stadium now."
Harry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the
Weasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the
Great Hall with Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor.
"Feeling all right. Harry?" Bagman asked as they went down the stone steps
onto the grounds. "Confident?"
"I'm okay," said Harry. It was sort of true; he was nervous, but he kept running
over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked,
and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better.
They walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now completely
unrecognizable. A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it.
There was a gap right in front of them: the entrance to the vast maze. The
passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.
Five minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices
and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The
sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear.
Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came
walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions. They
were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who
had his on the back of his moleskin vest.
"We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze," said Professor
McGonagall to the champions. "If you get into difficulty, and wish to be
rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do
you understand?"
The champions nodded.
"Off you go, then!" said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.
"Good luck. Harry," Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in
different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now
pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, "Sonorus," and his magically
magnified voice echoed into the stands.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is
about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in first
place, with eighty-five points each - Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter,
both of Hogwarts School!" The cheers and applause sent birds from the
Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. "In second place, with
eighty points - Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!" More applause.
"And in third place - Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!"
Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding
Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and they waved
back, beaming at him.
"So ... on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!" said Bagman. "Three - two - one -"
He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into
the maze.
The towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because
they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the
surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze. Harry felt
almost as though he were underwater again. He pulled out his wand, muttered,
"Lumos," and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.
After about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each other.
"See you," Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right.
Harry heard Bagman's whistle for the second time. Krum had entered the maze.
Harry sped up. His chosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned right,
and hurried on, holding his wand high over his head, trying to see as far ahead
as possible. Still, there was nothing in sight.
Bagman's whistle blew in the distance for the third time. All of the champions
were now inside.
Harry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that he was being watched was
upon him. The maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky
overhead deepened to navy. He reached a second fork.
"Point Me," he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.
The wand spun around once and pointed toward his right, into solid hedge.
That way was north, and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center
of the maze. The best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as
soon as possible.
The path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right turn and took it,
he again found his way unblocked. Harry didn't know why, but the lack of
obstacles was unnerving him. Surely he should have met something by now? It
felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security. Then he
heard movement right behind him. He held out his wand, ready to attack, but
its beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the righthand side. Cedric looked severely shaken. The sleeve of his robe was smoking.
"Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts!" he hissed. "They're enormous - I only just got
away!"
He shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path. Keen to put
plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts, Harry hurried off again.
Then, as he turned a corner, he saw ... a dementor gliding toward him. Twelve
feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it
advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him. Harry could hear its rattling
breath; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to
do....
He summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his might on
the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione,
raised his wand, and cried, "Expecto Patronum!"
A silver stag erupted from the end of Harry's wand and galloped toward the
dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes. . . . Harry had
never seen a dementor stumble.
"Hang on!" he shouted, advancing in the wake of his silver Patronus, "You're a
boggart! Riddikulus!"
There was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke. The
silver stag faded from sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he could have
used some he moved on, quickly and quietly as possible,
listening hard, his wand held high once more.
Left ... right... left again . . . Twice he found himself facing dead ends. He did
the Four-Point Spell again and found that he was going too far east. He turned
back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him.
Harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand's beam at it. This looked
like some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to blast
it out of the way.
"Reducio!" he said.
The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he
should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What
would happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or
should he double back?
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.
"Fleur?" Harry yelled.
There was silence. He stared all around him. What had happened to her? Her
scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead. He took a deep breath
and ran through the enchanted mist.
The world turned upside down. Harry was hanging from the ground, with his
hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the
bottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there,
terrified. It felt as though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now
become the ceiling. Below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched
endlessly. He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall
away from the earth completely.
Think, he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his head, think. . .
But not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden
reversal of ground and sky. Did he dare move his foot? He could hear the
blood pounding in his ears. He had two choices - try and move, or send up red
sparks, and get rescued and disqualified from the task.
He shut his eyes, so he wouldn't be able to see the view of endless space below
him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling.
Immediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell forward onto his knees onto the
wonderfully solid ground. He felt temporarily limp with shock. He took a deep,
steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over his
shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him
in the moonlight.
He paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of Fleur.
He was sure it had been she who had screamed. What had she met? Was she
all right? There was no sign of red sparks - did that mean she had got herself
out of trouble, or was she in such trouble that she couldn't reach her wand?
Harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease . . . but at the same
time, he couldn't help thinking. One champion down. . .
The cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no longer
in the running. He'd got this far, hadn't he? What if he actually managed to
win? Fleetingly, and for the first time since he'd found himself champion, he
saw again that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of
the school. . . .
He met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead ends. Twice he took
the same wrong turning. Finally, he found a new route and started to jog along
it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge
walls. Then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a Blast-Ended
Skrewt.
Cedric was right - it was enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a giant
scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick armor
glinted in the light from Harry's wand, which he pointed at it.
"Stupefy!"
The spell hit the skrewt's armor and rebounded; Harry ducked just in time, but
could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt issued a
blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.
"Impedimenta!" Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt's armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
"IMPEDIMENTA!"
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze - he had managed to hit it on its
fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it and
ran, hard, in the opposite direction - the Impediment Curse was not permanent;
the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcing himself
to stop, heart hammering, he performed the Four-Point Spell again,
backtracked, and chose a path that would take him northwest.
He had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard
something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead.
"What are you doing?" yelled Cedric's voice. "What the hell d'you think you're
doing?"
And then Harry heard Krum's voice.
"Crucio!"
The air was suddenly full of Cedric’s yells. Horrified, Harry began sprinting up
his path, trying to find a way into Cedric's. When none appeared, he tried the
Reductor Curse again. It wasn't very effective, but it burned a small hole in the
hedge through which Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and
branches until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it, tearing
his robes, and looking to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the
ground, Krum standing over him.
Harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as Krum looked up.
Krum turned and began to run.
"Stupefy!" Harry yelled.
The spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in his tracks, fell forward, and
lay motionless, facedown in the grass. Harry-dashed over to Cedric, who had
stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face.
"Are you all right?" Harry said roughly, grabbing Cedric's arm.
"Yeah," panted Cedric. "Yeah ... I don't believe it... he crept up behind me. ... I
heard him, I turned around, and he had his wand on me. . . ."
Cedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry looked down at Krum.
"I can't believe this ... I thought he was all right," Harry said, staring at Krum.
"So did I," said Cedric.
"Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?" said Harry.
"Yeah," said Cedric. "You don't think Krum got her too?"
"I don't know," said Harry slowly.
"Should we leave him here?" Cedric muttered.
"No," said Harry. "I reckon we should send up red sparks. Someone'll come
and collect him . . . otherwise he'll probably be eaten by a skrewt."
"He'd deserve it," Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and shot
a shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking
the spot where he lay.
Harry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around
them. Then Cedric said, "Well... I s'pose we'd better go on. . . ."
"What?" said Harry. "Oh . . . yeah . . . right. . ."
It was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been briefly united against Krum -
now the fact that they were opponents came back to Harry. The two of them
proceeded up the dark path without speaking, then Harry turned left, and Cedric
right. Cedric's footsteps soon died away.
Harry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure he was
moving in the right direction. It was between him and Cedric now. His desire
to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could hardly
believe what he'd just seen Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable Curse on a
fellow human being meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody had
told them. Krum surely couldn't have wanted the Triwizard Cup that
sped up.
Every so often he hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made him feel
sure he was getting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode down a long,
straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an
extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his
Monster Book of Monsters.
It was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion: great clawed paws and a
long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a
woman. She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry as he
approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to
spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she
spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.
"You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me."
"So ... so will you move, please?" said Harry, knowing what the answer was
going to be.
"No," she said, continuing to pace. "Not unless you can answer my riddle.
Answer on your first guess - I let you pass. Answer wrongly - I attack. Remain
silent - I will let you walk away from me unscathed."
Harry's stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this
sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he
could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an
alternative route to the center.
"Okay," he said. "Can I hear the riddle?"
The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and
recited:
"First think of the person who lives in disguise,
Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.
Next, tell me what's always the last thing to mend,
The middle of middle and end of the end?
And finally give me the sound often heard
During the search for a hard-to-find word.
Now string them together, and answer me this,
Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss?"
Harry gaped at her.
"Could I have it again . . . more slowly?" he asked tentatively. She blinked at
him, smiled, and repeated the poem. "All the clues add up to a creature I
wouldn't want to kiss?" Harry asked.
She merely smiled her mysterious smile. Harry took that for a "yes." Harry
cast his mind around. There were plenty of animals he wouldn't want to kiss; his
immediate thought was a Blast-Ended Skrewt, but something told him that
wasn't the answer. He'd have to try and work out the clues. . . .
"A person in disguise," Harry muttered, staring at her, "who lies ... er ... that'd
be a - an impostor. No, that's not my guess! A - a spy? I'll come back to that. .
. could you give me the next clue again, please?"
She repeated the next lines of the poem.
"'The last thing to mend,'" Harry repeated. "Er ... no idea . . . 'middle of middle' .
. . could I have the last bit again?"
She gave him the last four lines.
"'The sound often heard during the search for a hard-to-find word,'" said Harry.
"Er . . . that'd be ... er ... hang on - 'er'! Er's a sound!"
The sphinx smiled at him.
"Spy ... er ... spy ... er ..." said Harry, pacing up and down. "A creature I
wouldn't want to kiss . . . a spider!”
The sphinx smiled more broadly. She got up, stretched her front legs, and then
moved aside for him to pass.
"Thanks!" said Harry, and, amazed at his own brilliance, he dashed forward.
He had to be close now, he had to be. ... His wand was telling him he was bang
on course; as long as he didn't meet anything too horrible, he might have a
chance. . . .
Harry broke into a run. He had a choice of paths up ahead. "Point Me!" he
whispered again to his wand, and it spun around and pointed him to the righthand one. He dashed up this one and saw light ahead.
The Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away. Suddenly
a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him.
Cedric was going to get there first. Cedric was sprinting as fast as he could
toward the cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was much
taller, had much longer legs -
Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left, moving quickly
along a path that intersected with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was
about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it -
"Cedric!" Harry bellowed. "On your left!"
Cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid
colliding with it, but in his haste, he tripped. Harry saw Cedric's wand fly out of
his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon
Cedric.
"Stupefy!" Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider's gigantic, hairy black body, but
for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider
jerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.
"Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy!"
But it was no use - the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells
were doing no more than aggravating it. Harry had one horrifying glimpse of
eight shining black eyes and razor-sharp pincers before it was upon him.
He was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he tried to kick it;
his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain.
He could hear Cedric yelling "Stupefy!" too, but his spell had no more effect
than Harry's - Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more
and shouted "Expelliarmus!"
It worked - the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that
Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath him.
Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider's underbelly, as he had
done with the skrewt, and shouted "Stupefy!''just as Cedric yelled the same
thing.
The two spells combined did what one alone had not: The spider keeled over
sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy
legs.
"Harry!" he heard Cedric shouting. "You all right? Did it fall on you?"
"No," Harry called back, panting. He looked down at his leg. It was bleeding
freely. He could see some sort of thick, gluey secretion from the spider's pincers
on his torn robes. He tried to get up, but his leg was shaking badly and did not
want to support his weight. He leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath,
and looked around.
Cedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup, which was gleaming behind
him.
"Take it, then," Harry panted to Cedric. "Go on, take it. You're there."
But Cedric didn't move. He merely stood there, looking at Harry. Then he
turned to stare at the cup. Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its
golden light. Cedric looked around at Harry again, who was now holding onto
the hedge to support himself. Cedric took a deep breath.
"You take it. You should win. That's twice you've saved my neck in here."
"That's not how it's supposed to work," Harry said. He felt angry; his leg was
very painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and
after all his efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he'd beaten Harry to ask
Cho to the ball. "The one who reaches the cup first gets the points. That's you.
I'm telling you, I'm not going to win any races on this leg."
Cedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider, away from the cup,
shaking his head.
"No," he said.
"Stop being noble," said Harry irritably. "Just take it, then we can get out of
here."
Cedric watched Harry steadying himself, holding tight to the hedge.
"You told me about the dragons," Cedric said. "I would've gone down in the
first task if you hadn't told me what was coming."
"I had help on that too," Harry snapped, trying to mop up his bloody leg with
his robes. "You helped me with the egg - we're square."
"I had help on the egg in the first place," said Cedric.
"We're still square," said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook violently as he
put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him.
"You should've got more points on the second task," said Cedric mulishly.
"You stayed behind to get all the hostages. I should've done that."
"I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!" said
Harry bitterly. "Just take the cup!"
"No," said Cedric.
He stepped over the spider's tangled legs to join Harry, who stared at him.
Cedric was serious. He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff
House hadn't had in centuries.
"Go on," Cedric said. He looked as though this was costing him every ounce of
resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed decided.
Harry looked from Cedric to the cup. For one shining moment, he saw himself
emerging from the maze, holding it. He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup
aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho's face shining with admiration, more
clearly than he had ever seen it before . . . and then the picture faded, and he
found himself staring at Cedric's shadowy, stubborn face.
"Both of us," Harry said.
"What?"
"We'll take it at the same time. It's still a Hogwarts victory. We'll tie for it."
Cedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms.
"You - you sure?"
"Yeah," said Harry. "Yeah . . . we've helped each other out, haven't we? We
both got here. Let's just take it together."
For a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn't believe his ears; then his
face split in a grin.
"You're on," he said. "Come here."
He grabbed Harrys arm below the shoulder and helped Harry limp toward the
plinth where the cup stood. When they had reached it, they both held a hand
out over one of the cup's gleaming handles.
"On three, right?" said Harry. "One - two - three -"
He and Cedric both grasped a handle.
Instantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the
ground. He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was
pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO – FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE
Harry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way, and he fell
forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head.
"Where are we?" he said.
Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked
around.
They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled
miles - perhaps hundreds of miles - for even the mountains surrounding the
castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown
graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew
tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make
out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.
Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.
"Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?" he asked.
"Nope," said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was completely
silent and slightly eerie. "Is this supposed to be part of the task?"
"I dunno," said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. "Wands out, d'you
reckon?"
"Yeah," said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him.
They pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had, yet
again, the strange feeling that they were being watched.
"Someone's coming," he said suddenly.
Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer,
walking steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn't make out a
face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it
was carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded
cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And - several paces nearer,
the gap between them closing all the time - Harry saw that the thing in the
persons arms looked like a baby ... or was it merely a bundle of robes?
Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot
him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.
It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For a
second. Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another.
And then, without warning, Harry's scar exploded with pain. It was agony such
as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his
hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see
nothing at all; his head was about to split open.
From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, "Kill the
spare."
A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night:
"Avada Kedavra!"
A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he heard something
heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch
that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he
opened his stinging eyes.
Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.
For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric's face, at his
open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at
his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry's
mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb
disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.
The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was
dragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it
flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it.
TOM RIDDLE
The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him from
neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing from
the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him - hit him with a hand
that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood. It was
Wormtail.
"You!" he gasped.
But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy
checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably,
rumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the
headstone that he couldn't move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black
material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry's mouth;
then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn't
make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn't turn his
head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of
him.
Cedric's body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him,
glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry's wand was on the
ground at Cedric's feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby
was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry
watched it, and his scar seared with pain again . . . and he suddenly knew that
he didn't want to see what was in those robes ... he didn't want that bundle
opened....
He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake
slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied.
Wormtail’s fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as
though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back
within Harry's range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to
the foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water - Harry could hear
it slopping around - and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used; a
great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in.
The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more
persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying
himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly there were
crackling names beneath it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness.
The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface began not only
to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was
thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The movements
beneath the robes became more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice
again.
"Hurry!"
The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might have been
encrusted with diamonds.
"It is ready. Master."
"Now ..." said the cold voice.
Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them,
and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his
mouth.
It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something
ugly, slimy, and blind - but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail
had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry
had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a
dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face -
no child alive ever had a face like that - flat and snakelike, with gleaming red
eyes.
The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around
Wormtail's neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back, and
Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail's weak, pale face in the firelight as
he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw
the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion.
And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and
it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a
soft thud.
Let it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please. . .
let it drown. . . .
Wormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond his
wits. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night.
"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you wil lrenew your son!"
The surface of the grave at Harry's feet cracked. Horrified, Harry watched as a
fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail's command and fell softly into
the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent sparks
in all directions and turned a vivid, poisonous-looking blue.
And now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining silver
dagger from inside his cloak. His voice broke into petrified sobs.
"Flesh - of the servant - w-willingly given - you will - revive - your master. "
He stretched his right hand out in front of him - the hand with the missing
finger. He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward.
Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened - he
closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that
pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with
the dagger too. He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail's
anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the
cauldron. Harry couldn't stand to look . . . but the potion had turned a burning
red; the light of it shone through Harry's closed eyelids. . . .
Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until Harry felt
Wormtail's anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was right
in front of him.
"B-blood of the enemy . . . forcibly taken .. . you will. . . resurrect your foe."
Harry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly. . .. Squinting
down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver
dagger shaking in Wormtails remaining hand. He felt its point penetrate the
crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes.
Wormtail, still panting with pain, rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held
it to Harry's cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it.
He staggered back to the cauldron with Harrys blood. He poured it inside. The
liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done,
dropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the
ground, cradling the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing.
The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so
blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. Nothing happened.
. . .
Let it have drowned. Harry thought, let it have gone wrong. . .
And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished.
A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating
everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn't see Wormtail or Cedric or
anything but vapor hanging in the air. ... It's gone wrong, he thought. . . it's
drowned. .. please . . . please let it be dead. ...
But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge of terror,
the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the
cauldron.
"Robe me," said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and Wormtail,
sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the
black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them onehanded over his master's head.
The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry . . . and Harry stared
back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than
a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snakes with
slits for nostrils . . .
Lord Voldemort had risen again.
CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE – THE DEATH EATERS
Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His
hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own
chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats,
gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and
flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest
notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the
great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again,
hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a
deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised
it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against
the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there,
crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry,
laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.
Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his
arm in them.
"My Lord . . ." he choked, "my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise ..."
"Hold out your arm," said Voldemort lazily.
"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master ..."
He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again.
"The other arm, Wormtail."
"Master, please . . .please ..."
Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve
of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin
there, something like a vivid red tattoo - a skull with a snake protruding from its
mouth - the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the
Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's
uncontrollable weeping.
"It is back," he said softly, "they will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see
... now we shall know ..."
He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm.
The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let
out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and
Harry saw that it had turned jet black.
A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back
his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard.
"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?" he whispered,
his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. "And how many will be foolish
enough to stay away?"
He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the
graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a
cruel smile twisting his snakelike face.
"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father," he hissed softly.
"A Muggle and a fool. . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their
uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed
my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. ..."
Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he
walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass.
"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My
mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he
abandoned her when she told him what she was. ... He didn't like magic, my
father . . .
"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born. Potter,
and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage
. . . but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave
me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . ."
Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave.
"Listen to me, reliving family history . . ." he said quietly, "why, I am growing
quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . ."
The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the
yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were
hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly,
cautiously, as though they could
hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then
one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed
the hem of his black robes.
Master . . . Master " he murmured.
The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching
Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and
standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry,
Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they
left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however,
did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though
there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had
shivered.
"Welcome, Death Eaters,” said Voldemort quietly. "Thirteen years. . . thirteen
years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday,
we are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?"
He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils widening.
"I smell guilt," he said. "There is a stench or guilt upon the air.
A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but
did not dare to step back from him.
“I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact - such prompt
appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to
the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?"
No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still
sobbing over his bleeding arm.
“And I answer myself," whispered Voldemort, "they must have believed me
broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and
they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . .
"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise
again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against
mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the
times when I was mightier than any wizard living?
"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist,
one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay
allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods
and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?"
At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and
some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them.
"It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed. . . ."
One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling
from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet.
"Master!" he shrieked, "Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!"
Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.
"Crucio!"
The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound
must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought
desperately . . . anyone . .. anything. . .
Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground,
gasping.
"Get up, Avery," said Voldemort softly. "Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I
do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years'
repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt
already, have you not, Wormtail?"
He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.
"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You
deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?"
"Yes, Master," moaned Wormtail, "please. Master . . . please ..."
"Yet you helped return me to my body," said Voldemort coolly, watching
Wormtail sob on the ground. "Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped
me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers... ."
Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of
what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily
shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human
hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon
Wormtails bleeding wrist.
Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised
his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to
his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining
fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it
into powder.
"My Lord," he whispered. "Master ... it is beautiful. . . thank you... thank you.
..."
He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes.
"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail," said Voldemort.
"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . ."
Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new
hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on
Wormtail's right.
"Lucius, my slippery friend," he whispered, halting before him. "I am told that
you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a
respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggletorture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at
the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies
have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?"
"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert," came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly
from beneath the hood. "Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of
your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could
have prevented me -"
"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the
sky last summer?" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking
abruptly. "Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me.
... I expect more faithful service in the future."
"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. ..."
Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space - large enough for two
people - that separated Malfoy and the next man.
"The Lestranges should stand here," said Voldemort quietly. "But they are
entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than
renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be
honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us ... they are our
natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted
servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. ..."
He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused
before others and spoke to them.
"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now,
Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair.
Lord Voldemort will provide. ..."
"Thank you, Master . . . thank you," murmured Macnair.
"And here" - Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures - "we have
Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you,
Goyle?"
They bowed clumsily, muttering dully.
"Yes, Master ..."
"We will, Master...."
"The same goes for you, Nott," said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a
stooped figure in Mr. Goyles shadow.
"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful -"
"That will do," said Voldemort.
He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank,
red eyes, as though he could see people standing there.
"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One,
too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ...
he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant,
and who has already reentered my service."
The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another
through their masks.
"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our
young friend arrived here tonight. . . .
"Yes," said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle
flashed in Harry's direction. "Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my
rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor."
There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped
forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask.
"Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved
this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. .. ."
"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius," said Voldemort. "And it begins - and ends -
with my young friend here."
He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle
were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle.
"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?" Voldemort
said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he
almost screamed in agony. "You all know that on the night I lost my powers
and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him -
and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ... I
could not touch the boy."
Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's
cheek.
"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I
should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can
touch him now."
Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head
would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the
finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters.
"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's
foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my
friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I
was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I
was, even I do not know... I, who have gone further than anybody along the
path that leads to immortality. You know my goal - to conquer death. And
now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had
worked ... for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it.
Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the
means to help myself... for I had no body, and every spell that might have
helped me required the use of a wand. . . .
"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to
exist. ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of
my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and
perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain.
..."
The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters.
Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing.
"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I
dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors
were still abroad and searching for me.
I sometimes inhabited animals - snakes, of course, being my preference - but I
was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill
adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives;
none of them lasted long. . . .
"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A
wizard - young, foolish, and gullible - wandered across my path in the forest I
had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of...
for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school... he was easy to bend to my will...
he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his
body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed.
I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal
life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ..."
Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree.
The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed
upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.
"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had
been," Voldemort continued. "I returned to my hiding place far away, and I
will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my
powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour... I could not hope that I
would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that
any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. ..."
One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but
Voldemort took no notice.
"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened
at last... a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death
to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends,
and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had
long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along
the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His
filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that
they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a
dark shadow that possessed them. . . .
"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry
one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he
foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but
one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic.
"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the
end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail -
displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him -
convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He
overpowered her ... he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have
ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for - with a
little persuasion - she became a veritable mine of information.
"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this
year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only
too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things. . .
but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and
when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were
both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not
possess her. I disposed of her."
Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless.
"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him
dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the
able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able
to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary,
weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the
essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a
little help from my dear Nagini," Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually
circling snake, "a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom
Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong
enough to travel.
"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that
Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to
embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ...
I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength.
"I knew that to achieve this - it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that
revived me tonight - I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of
them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . .
"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he
was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any
wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so
many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again,
more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potters blood.
I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago .
. . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my
veins too. . . .
"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think
even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell
to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to
ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can
touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I
thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and
Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a
horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where
he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle-loving fool from morning until
night. So how could I take him?
"Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful
Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered
into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the
tournament - that he touched the Triwizard Cup first - the cup which my Death
Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach
of Dumbledore’s help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is
... the boy you all believed had been my downfall. ..."
Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his
wand.
"Crucio!"
It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were
on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly
in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out... to die ...
And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the
headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a
kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters'
laughter.
"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have
been stronger than me," said Voldemort. "But I want there to be no mistake in
anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now
going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when
there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give
him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt
which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini," he whispered, and the
snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching.
"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand."
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR – PRIORI INCANTATEM
Wormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own
weight before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand,
pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and then, with one swipe, cut
through the bonds tying Harry to the gravestone.
There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running
for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave,
as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and
Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood
were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric's body
lay and returned with Harry's wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry’s hand
without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of
watching Death Eaters.
"You have been taught how to duel. Harry Potter?" said Voldemort softly, his
red eyes glinting through the darkness.
At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling
club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. ... All he had learned
there was the Disarming Spell, "Expelliarmus". . . and what use would it be to
deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by
Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing the thing
against which Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable Avada Kedavra
curse - and Voldemort was right - his mother was not here to die for him this
time. ... He was quite unprotected. . . .
"We bow to each other. Harry," said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping
his snakelike face upturned to Harry. "Come, the niceties must be observed. . . .
Dumbledore would like you to show manners. . . . Bow to death, Harry. ..."
The Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemorts lipless mouth was smiling.
Harry did not bow. He was not going to let Voldemort play with him before
killing him ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction. . . .
"I said, bow," Voldemort said, raising his wand - and Harry felt his spine curve
as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the
Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.
"Very good," said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure
bearing down upon Harry lifted too. "And now you face me, like a man . . .
straight-backed and proud, the way your father died. . . .
"And now - we duel."
Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything to defend
himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus
Curse. The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew
where he was. . . . White-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his
head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than
he'd ever screamed in his life -
And then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet; he was shaking
as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off; he
staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters, and they pushed him
away, back toward Voldemort.
"A little break," said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils dilating with excitement,
"a little pause . . . That hurt, didn't it. Harry? You don't want me to do that
again, do you?"
Harry didn't answer. He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes
were telling him so ... he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do
about it... but he wasn't going to play along. He wasn't going to obey
Voldemort... he wasn't going to beg. . . .
"I asked you whether you want me to do that again," said Voldemort softly.
"Answer me! Imperial"
And Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the sensation that his mind had been
wiped of all thought. . . . Ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as though he were
floating, dreaming answer no ... say no ... just answer no. .. .
I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won't answer. . . .
Just answer no. . . .
I won't do it, I won't say it. ...
Just answer no. . . .
"I WON'T!"
And these words burst from Harry's mouth; they echoed through the graveyard,
and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been
thrown over him - back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all
over his body - back rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was
facing. . . .
"You won't?" said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were not laughing
now. "You won't say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach you
before you die. . . . Perhaps another little dose of pain?"
Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with the reflexes
born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he
rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort s father, and he heard it crack
as the curse missed him.
"We are not playing hide-and-seek, Harry," said Voldemort's soft, cold voice,
drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed. "You cannot hide from me. Does
this mean you are tired of our duel? Does this mean that you would prefer me
to finish it now, Harry? Come out, Harry . . . come out and play, then ... it will
be quick ... it might even be painless ... I would not know... I have never died. . .
."
Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come. There was
no hope ... no help to be had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he
knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die
crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die
kneeling at Voldemort s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he
was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . .
Before Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone. Harry
stood up ... he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him,
and threw himself around the headstone, facing Voldemort.
Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, "Expelliarmus!" Voldemort cried,
"Avada Kedavra!"
A jet of green light issued from Voldemorts wand just as a jet of red light
blasted from Harry's - they met in midair - and suddenly Harry's wand was
vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized
up around it; he couldn't have released it if he'd wanted to - and a narrow beam
of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold.
Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort's long
white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating.
And then - nothing could have prepared Harry for this - he felt his feet lift from
the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands
still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They glided away
from the tombstone of Voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of
ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eaters were shouting;
they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, reforming the
circle around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of
them drawing their wands -
The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the
wands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and
Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden,
dome-shaped web, a
cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals, their cries
strangely muffled now. . . .
"Do nothing!" Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red
eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break
the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry's; Harry held onto his
wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken.
"Do nothing unless I command you!" Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters.
And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. ... It was coming from
every thread of the light-spun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort. It
was a sound Harry recognized, though he had heard it only once before in his
life: phoenix song.
It was the sound of hope to Harry. . . the most beautiful and welcome thing he
had ever heard in his life. . . . He felt as though the song were inside him instead
of just around him. ... It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore, and it
was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . .
Don't break the connection.
I know. Harry told the music, I know I mustn't. . . but no sooner had he thought
it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more
powerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between him and Voldemort
changed too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down
the thread connecting the wands - Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his
hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way. . . . The
direction of the beams movement was now toward him, from Voldemort, and he
felt his wand shudder angrily. . . .
As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harrys wand tip, the wood beneath
his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead
moved, the harder Harry's wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not
survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers
-
He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back
toward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed . . . and
slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they
began to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort's wand that was
vibrating extra-hard now . . . Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost
fearful. . . .
One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemorts
wand. Harry didn't understand why he was doing it, didn't know what it might
achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing
that bead of light right back into Voldemort s wand . . . and slowly . . . very
slowly ... it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment. . . and
then it connected. . . .
At once, Voldemorts wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then -
Voldemort's red eyes widened with shock - a dense, smoky hand flew out of the
tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail. . . more
shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began to blossom from
Voldemorts wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were
made of the solidest, densest smoke. ... It was a head . . . now a chest and arms .
. . the torso of Cedric Diggory.
If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been
then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of
golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric
Diggory (was it a ghost? it looked so
solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort s wand, as though it
were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel. . . and this shade of Cedric
stood up, and looked up and down the golden thread of light, and spoke.
"Hold on. Harry," it said.
Its voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort ... his wide red
eyes were still shocked ... he had no more expected this than Harry had . . . and,
very dimly. Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling
around the edges of the golden dome. .
More screams of pain from the wand . . . and then something else emerged from
its tip ... the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso
... an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of
the end of the wand just as Cedric had done . . . and his ghost, or his shadow, or
whatever it was, fell next to Cedric's, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and
the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his
walking stick. . . .
"He was a real wizard, then?" the old man said, his eyes on Voldemort. "Killed
me, that one did. . . . You fight him, boy. . . ."
But already, yet another head was emerging ... and this head, gray as a smoky
statue, was a woman's. . . . Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep
his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others,
staring. . . .
The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes.
"Don't let go, now!" she cried, and her voice echoed like Cedrics as though
from very far away. "Don't let him get you, Harry - don't let go!"
She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of
the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it... and
Voldemort's dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered
words of encouragement to Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn't hear to
Voldemort.
And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemorts wand . . . and
Harry knew when he saw it who it would be ... he knew, as though he had
expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand . . .
knew, because the man appearing was the one he'd thought of more than any
other tonight. . . .
The smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as Bertha
had done, straightened up, and looked at him . . . and Harry, his arms shaking
madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his father.
"Your mother's coming . . ." he said quietly. "She wants to see you ... it will be
all right.. . hold on. . . ."
And she came. . . first her head, then her body... a young woman with long hair,
the smoky, shadowy form of Lily Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort's
wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like her husband. She walked close
to Harry, looking down at him, and she spoke in the same distant, echoing voice
as the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his
victims prowled around him, could not hear. . ..
"When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments . . . but we
will give you time. . . you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to
Hogwarts ... do you understand, Harry?"
"Yes," Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was
slipping and sliding beneath his fingers.
"Harry . . ." whispered the figure of Cedric, "take my body back, will you?
Take my body back to my parents, ..."
"I will," said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand.
"Do it now," whispered his father's voice, "be ready to run . . . do it now. ..."
"NOW!" Harry yelled; he didn't think he could have held on for another
moment anyway - he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the
golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died - but the
shadowy figures of Voldemort's victims did not disappear - they were closing in
upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze -
And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death
Eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses
following him, hearing them hit the headstones - he was dodging curses and
graves, pelting toward Cedric's body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his
whole being concentrated on what he had to do -
"Stun him!" he heard Voldemort scream.
Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red
light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand
more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel -
"Impedimenta!" he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the
Death Eaters running at him.
From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there
was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard
more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell,
stretching out his hand to grab Cedric's
"Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!" shrieked Voldemort. Harry's hand
had closed on Cedric's wrist; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort,
but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach -
Voldemort's red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his mouth curl into a
smile, saw him raise his wand.
"Accio!" Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup. It flew into the
air and soared toward him. Harry caught it by the handle -
He heard Voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk
behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked - it was speeding him away
in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him. . . . They were going
back.
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE – VERITASERUM
Harry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into grass; the
smell of it filled his nostrils. He had closed his eyes while the Portkey
transported him, and he kept them closed now. He did not move. All the breath
seemed to have been knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly he
felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship. To
hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still
clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Triwizard Cup and Cedric's body. He
felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of
his brain if he let go of either of them. Shock and exhaustion kept him on the
ground, breathing in the smell of the grass, waiting . . . waiting for someone to
do something . . . something to happen . . . and all the while, his scar burned
dully on his forehead. . . .
A torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were voices everywhere,
footsteps, screams. ... He remained where he was, his face screwed up against
the noise, as though it were a nightmare that would pass. . . .
Then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over.
"Harry! Harry!”
He opened his eyes.
He was looking up at the starry sky, and Albus Dumbledore was crouched over
him. The dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them, pushing
nearer; Harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their
footsteps.
He had come back to the edge of the maze. He could see the stands rising
above him, the shapes of people moving in them, the stars above.
Harry let go of the cup, but he clutched Cedric to him even more tightly. He
raised his free hand and seized Dumbledore's wrist, while Dumbledore's face
swam in and out of focus.
"He's back," Harry whispered. "He's back. Voldemort."
"What's going on? What's happened?"
The face of Cornelius Fudge appeared upside down over Harry; it looked white,
appalled.
"My God - Diggory!" it whispered. "Dumbledore - he's dead!"
The words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to
those around them . . . and then others shouted it - screeched it - into the night -
"He's dead!" "He's dead!” "Cedric Diggory! Dead!"
"Harry, let go of him," he heard Fudge's voice say, and he felt fingers trying to
pry him from Cedric's limp body, but Harry wouldn't let him go. Then
Dumbledore's face, which was still blurred and misted, came closer.
"Harry, you can't help him now. It's over. Let go."
"He wanted me to bring him back," Harry muttered - it seemed important to
explain this. "He wanted me to bring him back to his parents. ..."
"That's right. Harry . . . just let go now. . . ."
Dumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and
thin, raised Harry from the ground and set -him on his feet. Harry swayed. His
head was pounding. His injured leg would no longer support his weight. The
crowd around them jostled, fighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on him -
"What's happened?" "What's wrong with him?" "Diggorys dead!"
"He'll need to go to the hospital wing!" Fudge was saying loudly. "He's ill, he's
injured - Dumbledore, Diggory's parents, they're here, they're in the stands. ..."
"I'll take Harry, Dumbledore, I'll take him -"
"No, I would prefer-"
"Dumbledore, Amos Diggorys running . . . he's coming over. . . . Don't you
think you should tell him - before he sees - ?"
"Harry, stay here -"
Girls were screaming, sobbing hysterically.... The scene flickered oddly before
Harry's eyes. . . .
"Its all right, son, I've got you . . . come on ... hospital wing . . ."
"Dumbledore said stay," said Harry thickly, the pounding in his scar making
him feel as though he was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse than
ever.
"You need to lie down. . .. Come on now...."
Someone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling, half carrying him
through the frightened crowd. Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and
shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him
back to the castle. Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship,
Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.
"What happened. Harry?" the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the stone
steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. It was Mad-Eye Moody.
"Cup was a Portkey," said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall. "Took me
and Cedric to a graveyard . . . and Voldemort was there . . . Lord Voldemort..."
Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Up the marble stairs . . .
"The Dark Lord was there? What happened then?"
"Killed Cedric . . . they killed Cedric. . . ."
"And then?"
Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Along the corridor . . .
"Made a potion . . . got his body back. . . ."
"The Dark Lord got his body back? He's returned?"
"And the Death Eaters came . . . and then we dueled. ..."
"You dueled with the Dark Lord?"
"Got away . . . my wand . . . did something funny. ... I saw my mum and dad . . .
they came out of his wand. ..."
"In here. Harry ... in here, and sit down. . . . You'll be all right now . . . drink
this. ..."
Harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands.
"Drink it... you'll feel better . . . come on, now. Harry, I need to know exactly
what happened. ..."
Moody helped tip the stuff down Harrys throat; he coughed, a peppery taste
burning his throat. Moody's office came into sharper focus, and so did Moody
himself. ... He looked as white as Fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed
unblinkingly upon Harry's face.
"Voldemort's back, Harry? You're sure he's back? How did he do it?"
"He took stuff from his father's grave, and from Wormtail, and me," said Harry.
His head felt clearer; his scar wasn't hurting so badly; he could now see Moodys
face distinctly, even though the office was dark. He could still hear screaming
and shouting from the distant Quidditch field.
"What did the Dark Lord take from you?" said Moody.
"Blood," said Harry, raising his arm. His sleeve was ripped where Wormtail's
dagger had torn it.
Moody let out his breath in a long, low hiss.
"And the Death Eaters? They returned?"
"Yes," said Harry. "Loads of them . . ."
"How did he treat them?" Moody asked quietly. "Did he forgive them?"
But Harry had suddenly remembered. He should have told Dumbledore, he
should have said it straightaway -
"There's a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There's a Death Eater here - they put my
name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end -"
Harry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back down.
"I know who the Death Eater is," he said quietly.
"Karkaroff?" said Harry wildly. "Where is he? Have you got him? Is he
locked up?"
"Karkaroff?" said Moody with an odd laugh. "Karkaroff fled tonight, when he
felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm. He betrayed too many faithful
supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . . but I doubt he will get far.
The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies."
"Karkaroff's gone? He ran away? But then - he didn't put my name in the
goblet?"
"No," said Moody slowly. "No, he didn't. It was I who did that."
Harry heard, but didn't believe.
"No, you didn't," he said. "You didn't do that. . . you can't have done..."
"I assure you I did," said Moody, and his magical eye swung around and fixed
upon the door, and Harry knew he was making sure that there was no one
outside it. At the same time, Moody drew out his wand and pointed it at Harry.
"He forgave them, then?" he said. "The Death Eaters who went free? The ones
who escaped Azkaban?"
"What?" said Harry.
He was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him. This was a bad joke,
it had to be.
"I asked you," said Moody quietly, "whether he forgave the scum who never
even went to look for him. Those treacherous cowards who wouldn't even
brave Azkaban for him. The faithless, worthless bits of filth who were brave
enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight of
the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky."
"You fired . . . What are you talking about. . . ?"
"I told you. Harry ... I told you. If there's one thing I hate more than any other,
it's a Death Eater who walked free. They turned their backs on my master when
he needed them most. I expected him to punish them. I expected him to torture
them. Tell me he
hurt them, Harry. . . ." Moody's face was suddenly lit with an insane smile.
"Tell me he told them that I, I alone remained faithful... prepared to risk
everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all... you"
"You didn't... it - it can't be you. ..."
"Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the name of a different
school? I did. Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you
or prevent you from winning the tournament? I did. Who nudged Hagrid into
showing you the dragons? I did. Who helped you see the only way you could
beat the dragon? I did"
Moody's magical eye had now left the door. It was fixed upon Harry. His
lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever.
"It hasn't been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing
suspicion. I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess, so that my hand
would not be detectable in your success. Dumbledore would have been very
suspicious if you had managed everything too easily. As long as you got into
that maze, preferably with a decent head start - then, I knew, I would have a
chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear. But I
also had to contend with your stupidity. The second task . . . that was when I
was most afraid we would fail. I was keeping watch on you, Potter. I knew
you hadn't worked out the egg's clue, so I had to give you another hint -"
"You didn't," Harry said hoarsely. "Cedric gave me the clue -"
"Who told Cedric to open it underwater? I did. I trusted that he would pass the
information on to you. Decent people are so easy to manipulate, Potter. I was
sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons, and so
he did. But even then,
Potter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was watching all the time ... all
those hours in the library. Didn't you realize that the book you needed was in
your dormitory all along? I planted it there early on, I gave it to the
Longbottom boy, don't you remember? Magical Water Plants of the
Mediterranean. It would have told you all you needed to know about
gillyweed. I expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help.
Longbottom would have told you in an instant. But you did not. . . you did not.
. . . You have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all.
"So what could I do? Feed you information from another innocent source. You
told me at the Yule Ball a house-elf called Dobby had given you a Christmas
present. I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning. I
staged a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who
had been taken, and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed. And your
little elf friend ran straight to Snape's office and then hurried to find you..."
Moodys wand was still pointing directly at Harry's heart. Over his shoulder,
foggy shapes were moving in the Foe-Glass on the wall.
"You were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you had drowned. But luckily,
Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. I
breathed again.
"You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight, of
course," said Moody. "I was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer
hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. I Stunned Fleur
Delacour as she passed. I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would
finish Diggory and leave your path to the cup clear."
Harry stared at Moody. He just didn't see how this could be. ... Dumbledore's
friend, the famous Auror. . . the one who had caught so many Death Eaters ... It
made no sense ... no sense at all. ...
The foggy shapes in the Foe-Glass were sharpening, had become more distinct.
Harry could see the outlines of three people over Moody's shoulder, moving
closer and closer. But Moody wasn't watching them. His magical eye was
upon Harry.
"The Dark Lord didn't manage to kill you. Potter, and he so wanted to,"
whispered Moody. "Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done
it for him. I gave you to him - the thing he needed above all to regenerate - and
then I killed you for him. I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters. I
will be his dearest, his closest supporter . . . closer than a son. ..."
Moody's normal eye was bulging, the magical eye fixed upon Harry. The door
was barred, and Harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time. . . .
"The Dark Lord and I," said Moody, and he looked completely insane now,
towering over Harry, leering down at him, "have much in common. Both of us,
for instance, had very disappointing fathers . . . very disappointing indeed. Both
of us suffered the indignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers. And both
of us had the pleasure . . . the very great pleasure ... of killing our fathers to
ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order!"
"You're mad," Harry said - he couldn't stop himself- "you're mad!"
"Mad, am I?" said Moody, his voice rising uncontrollably. "We'll see! We'll
see who's mad, now that the Dark Lord has returned, with me at his side! He is
back, Harry Potter, you did not conquer him - and now - I conquer you!"
Moody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry plunged his own hand into
his robes -
"Stupefy!" There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering
and crashing, the door of Moody's office was blasted apart -
Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor. Harry, still staring at the
place where Moody's face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape,
and Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe-Glass. He
looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore
in front, his wand outstretched.
At that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said
Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared. The look upon
Dumbledore's face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad-Eye
Moody was more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There was no
benign smile upon Dumbledore's face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the
spectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of
power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat.
He stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moodys unconscious body,
and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible. Snape followed
him, looking into the Foe-Glass, where his own face was still visible, glaring
into the room. Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.
"Come along, Potter," she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching
as though she was about to cry. "Come along . . . hospital wing ..."
"No," said Dumbledore sharply.
"Dumbledore, he ought to - look at him - he's been through enough tonight -"
"He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand," said Dumbledore
curtly. "Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance
can there be recovery. He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he
has suffered tonight, and why,"
"Moody," Harry said. He was still in a state of complete disbelief. "How can it
have been Moody?"
"This is not Alastor Moody," said Dumbledore quietly. "You have never
known Alastor Moody. The real Moody would not have removed you from my
sight after what happened tonight. The moment he took you, I knew - and I
followed."
Dumbledore bent down over Moody's limp form and put a hand inside his
robes. He pulled out Moody's hip flask and a set of keys on a ring. Then he
turned to Professors McGonagall and Snape.
"Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go
down to the kitchens and bring up the house-elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly
go down to Hagrid's house, where you will find a large black dog sitting in the
pumpkin patch. Take the dog up to my office, tell him I will be with him
shortly, then come back here."
If either Snape or McGonagall found these instructions peculiar, they hid their
confusion. Both turned at once and left the office. Dumbledore walked over to
the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key in the lock, and opened it. It
contained a mass of spell-books. Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a second
key in the second lock, and opened the trunk again. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken Sneako-scopes, some
parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery Invisibility Cloak. Harry
watched, astounded, as Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth
keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk each time, and revealing
different contents each time. Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw
open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.
He was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying on the
floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in
appearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His wooden leg was gone, the
socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid, and
chunks of his grizzled hair were missing. Harry stared, thunderstruck, between
the sleeping Moody in the trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the floor
of the office.
Dumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell lightly onto the
floor beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over him.
"Stunned - controlled by the Imperius Curse - very weak," he said. "Of course,
they would have needed to keep him alive. Harry, throw down the imposter's
cloak - he's freezing. Madam Pomfrey will need to see him, but he seems in no
immediate danger."
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked it
around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the hip
flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick
glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
"Polyjuice Potion, Harry," said Dumbledore. "You see the simplicity of it, and
the brilliance. For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask, he's well
known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody close by,
so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair ..." Dumbledore
looked down on the Moody in the trunk. "The imposter has been cutting it off
all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight, our
fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequendy as he should have done
... on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see."
Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes fixed
upon the unconscious Moody on the floor. Harry stared at him too. Minutes
passed in silence... .
Then, before Harry's very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to
change. The scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the
mangled nose became whole and started to shrink. The long mane of grizzled
gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw.
Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew
in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man's face
as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel
in every direction.
Harry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop
of fair hair. He knew who he was. He had seen him in Dumbledore's Pensieve,
had watched him being led away from court by the dementors, trying to
convince Mr. Crouch that he was innocent. . . but he was lined around the eyes
now and looked much older. . . .
There were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor. Snape had returned with
Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them.
"Crouch!" Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. "Barty Crouch!"
"Good heavens," said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring down at
the man on the floor.
Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape's legs. Her mouth opened wide
and she let out a piercing shriek.
"Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?"
She flung herself forward onto the young man's chest.
"You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master's son!"
"He is simply Stunned, Winky," said Dumbledore. "Step aside, please.
Severus, you have the potion?"
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid: the
Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got up,
bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position against the
wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape, and
McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all. Winky remained on her
knees, trembling, her hands over her face. Dumbledore forced the mans mouth
open and poured three drops inside it. Then he pointed his wand at the mans
chest and said, "Ennervate."
Crouch's son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused.
Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.
"Can you hear me?" Dumbledore asked quietly.
The man's eyelids flickered.
"Yes," he muttered.
"I would like you to tell us," said Dumbledore softly, "how you came to be
here. How did you escape from Azkaban?"
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,
expressionless voice.
"My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father to
rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He
agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draft of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my mother's hairs. She took a draft of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my hairs. We took on each other's appearance."
Winky was shaking her head, trembling.
"Say no more. Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into
trouble!"
But Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice.
"The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering
Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My father
smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watching
through their doors.
"My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was careful to drink
Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name and bearing my
appearance. Everyone believed her to be me."
The man's eyelids flickered.
"And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?" said
Dumbledore quietly.
"Staged my mother's death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty. The
house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be
controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I had
recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master . . . of returning to
his service."
"How did your father subdue you?" said Dumbledore.
"The Imperius Curse," Moody said. "I was under my fathers control. I was
forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the
house-elf. She was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She persuaded my
father to give me occasional treats. Rewards for my good behavior."
"Master Barty, Master Barty," sobbed Winky through her hands. "You isn't
ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble. ..."
"Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?" said Dumbledore softly.
"Did anyone know except your father and the house-elf?"
"Yes," said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. "A witch in my father's office.
Bertha Jorkins. She came to the house with papers for my father s signature.
He was not at home. Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen, to
me. But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. She came to investigate.
She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak. My
father arrived home. She confronted him. He put a very powerful Memory
Charm on her to make her forget what she'd found out. Too powerful. He said
it damaged her memory permanently."
"Why is she coming to nose into my masters private business?" sobbed Winky.
"Why isn't she leaving us be?"
"Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup," said Dumbledore.
"Winky talked my father into it," said Crouch, still in the same monotonous
voice. "She spent months persuading him. I had not left the house for years. I
had loved Quidditch. Let him go, she said. He will be in his Invisibility Cloak.
He can watch. Let him smell fresh air for once. She said my mother would
have wanted it. She told my father that my mother had died to give me
freedom. She had not saved me for a life of imprisonment. He agreed in the
end.
"It was carefully planned. My father led me and Winky up to the Top Box
early in the day. Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father. I
was to sit there, invisible. When everyone had left the box, we would emerge.
Winky would appear to be alone. Nobody would ever know.
"But Winky didn't know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight my
father's Imperius Curse. There were times when I was almost myself again.
There were brief periods when I seemed outside his control. It happened, there,
in the Top Box. It was like waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in
public, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out
of a boys pocket. I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole
it. Winky didn't know. Winky is frightened of heights. She had her face
hidden."
"Master Barty, you bad boy!" whispered Winky, tears trickling between her
fingers.
"So you took the wand," said Dumbledore, "and what did you do with it?"
"We went back to the tent," said Crouch. "Then we heard them. We heard the
Death Eaters. The ones who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had
never suffered for my master. They had turned their backs on him. They were
not enslaved, as I was. They were free to seek him, but they did not. They were
merely making sport of Muggles. The sound of their voices awoke me. My
mind was clearer than it had been in years. I was angry. I had the wand.
I wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My father had left the
tent; he had gone to free the Muggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry.
She used her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She pulled me from the
tent, pulled me into the forest, away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her
back. I wanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show those Death Eaters
what loyalty to the Dark Lord meant, and to punish them for their lack of it. I
used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky.
"Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells everywhere. One of the
spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood. The bond connecting
us was broken. We were both Stunned.
"When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be nearby. He searched
the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there. He waited until
the other Ministry members had left the forest. He put me back under the
Imperius Curse and took me home. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him.
She had let me acquire a wand. She had almost let me escape."
Winky let out a wail of despair.
"Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And then . . . and then . . ."
Crouch's head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin spread across his face.
"My master came for me.
"He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail. My
master had found out that I was still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins in
Albania. He had tortured her. She told him a great deal. She told him about
the Triwizard Tournament. She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to
teach at Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm
my father had placed upon her. She told him I had escaped from Azkaban. She
told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master.
And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant - perhaps the most
faithful of all. My master conceived a plan, based upon the information Bertha
had given him. He needed me. He arrived at our house near midnight. My
father answered the door."
The smile spread wider over Crouch's face, as though recalling the sweetest
memory of his life. Winky's petrified brown eyes were visible through her
fingers. She seemed too appalled to speak.
"It was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my
master. Now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced
him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong. And
I was released. I awoke. I was myself again, alive as I hadn't been in years.
"And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?" said Dumbledore.
"He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him. I was ready. It
was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He
told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who would
guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do
so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he reached the
Triwizard Cup. Turn the cup into a Portkey, which would take the first person
to touch it to my master. But first -"
"You needed Alastor Moody," said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were blazing,
though his voice remained calm.
"Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand. We
journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion.
We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of his
own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank
it; I became Moody's double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face
Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a
disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley
I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed
up Moody's clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and
set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to
be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I
could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice
Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boom-slang skin from the
dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under
orders to search it."
"And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?" said Dumbledore.
"Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father's house, and to keep
watch over my father."
"But your father escaped," said Dumbledore.
"Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done.
There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it
was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send
letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But
Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped.
My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to
tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had
smuggled me from Azkaban.
"My master sent me word of my father's escape. He told me to stop him at all
costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter.
The map that had almost ruined everything."
"Map?" said Dumbledore quickly. "What map is this?"
"Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing more
ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape's office one night. He thought I
was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from Potter that
night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was
after Snape.
"For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one evening,
the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my Invisibility
Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the edge of the
forest. Then Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my
master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum. I killed
my father."
"Noooo!" wailed Winky. "Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you saying?"
"You killed your father," Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. "What did
you do with the body?"
"Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the map
with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore
joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked
back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told
Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come.
"Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my father's
body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father's
body. He became a bone ... I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in
the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid's cabin."
There was complete silence now, except for Winky's continued sobs. Then
Dumbledore said, "And tonight. . ."
"I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner," whispered
Barty Crouch. "Turned it into a Portkey. My master's plan worked. He is
returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards."
The insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his
shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side.
CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX – THE PARTING OF THE WAYS
Dumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with
disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it,
ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly. He
turned to Professor McGonagall.
"Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs?"
"Of course," said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly nauseous, as
though she had just watched someone being sick. However, when she drew out
her wand and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was quite steady.
"Severus" - Dumbledore turned to Snape - "please tell Madam Pomfrey to come
down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing. Then go
down into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and bring him up to this office.
He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the
hospital wing in half an hour's time if he needs me."
Snape nodded silently and swept out of the room.
"Harry?" Dumbledore said gently.
Harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all
the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He also
realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out
into the dark corridor.
"I want you to come up to my office first. Harry," he said quiedy as they headed
up the passageway. "Sirius is waiting for us there."
Harry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were
upon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it. He didn't want to have to
think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard
Cup. He didn't want to have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as
photographs, which kept flashing across his mind. Mad-Eye Moody, inside the
trunk. Wormtail, slumped on the ground, cradling his stump of an arm.
Voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric. . . dead . . . Cedric,
asking to be returned to his parents. . . .
"Professor," Harry mumbled, "where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory?"
"They are with Professor Sprout," said Dumbledore. His voice, which had been
so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for
the first time. "She was Head of Cedric's house, and knew him best."
They had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore gave the password, it sprang
aside, and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.
Dumbledore pushed it open. Sirius was standing there. His face was white and
gaunt as it had been when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment, he
had crossed the room.
"Harry, are you all right? I knew it - I knew something like this - what
happened?"
His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk.
"What happened?" he asked more urgently.
Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said. Harry was
only half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted
nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell
asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore.
There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown
across the office, and landed on Harry's knee.
"'Lo, Fawkes," said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix's beautiful scarletand-gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was something
comforting about his warm weight.
Dumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He
was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to
question him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.
"I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze.
Harry," said Dumbledore.
"We can leave that till morning, can't we, Dumbledore?" said Sirius harshly.
He had put a hand on Harrys shoulder. "Let him have a sleep. Let him rest."
Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of
Sirius's words. He leaned forward toward Harry.
Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.
"If I thought I could help you," Dumbledore said gently, "by putting you into an
enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would
have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know
better. Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel
it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I
ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what
happened."
The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and Harry
felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach,
warming him, and strengthening him.
He took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of
everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the
sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death
Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric's body, lying
on the ground beside the cup.
Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand
still tight on Harry's shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and
Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started.
It was even a relief; he felt almost as though something poisonous were being
extracted from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to
keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.
When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius
let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry
started. Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his
arm. Harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut
beneath them.
"He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,"
Harry told Dumbledore. "He said the protection my - my mother left in me -
he'd have it too. And he was right - he could touch me without hurting himself,
he touched my face."
For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph
in Dumbledore's eyes. But next second. Harry was sure he had imagined it, for
when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old
and weary as Harry had ever seen him.
"Very well," he said, sitting down again. "Voldemort has overcome that
particular barrier. Harry, continue, please."
Harry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the cauldron,
and told them all he could remember of Voldemort’s speech to the Death Eaters.
Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and
prepared to duel.
But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his
and Voldemort's wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep
talking, but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort's wand were
flooding into his mind. He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha
Jorkins ... his father . . . his mother . . .
He was glad when Sirius broke the silence.
"The wands connected?" he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore. "Why?"
Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested
look.
"Priori Incantatem," he muttered.
His eyes gazed into Harry's and it was almost as though an invisible beam of
understanding shot between them.
"The Reverse Spell effect?" said Sirius sharply.
"Exactly," said Dumbledore. "Harry's wand and Voldemorts wand share cores.
Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This
phoenix, in fact," he added, and he pointed at the scarlet-and-gold bird, perching
peacefully on Harry's knee.
"My wand's feather came from Fawkes?" Harry said, amazed.
"Yes," said Dumbledore. "Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the
second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago."
"So what happens when a wand meets its brother?" said Sirius.
"They will not work properly against each other," said Dumbledore. "If,
however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare
effect will take place. One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells
it has performed - in reverse. The most recent first. . . and then those which
preceded it. . . ."
He looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.
"Which means," said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry's face, "that
some form of Cedric must have reappeared."
Harry nodded again.
"Diggory came back to life?" said Sirius sharply.
"No spell can reawaken the dead," said Dumbledore heavily. "All that would
have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would
have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?"
"He spoke to me," Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again. "The . . . the
ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke."
"An echo," said Dumbledore, "which retained Cedric's appearance and
character. I am guessing other such forms appeared . . . less recent victims of
Voldemort's wand...."
"An old man," Harry said, his throat still constricted. "Bertha Jorkins. And . .
."
"Your parents?" said Dumbledore quietly.
"Yes," said Harry.
Sirius's grip on Harry's shoulder was now so tight it was painful.
"The last murders the wand performed," said Dumbledore, nodding. "In reverse
order. More would have appeared, of course, had you maintained the
connection. Very well, Harry, these echoes, these shadows . .. what did they
do?"
Harry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled
the edges of the golden web, how Voldemort had seemed to fear them, how the
shadow of Harry's mother had told him what to do, how Cedric's had made its
final request.
At this point. Harry found he could not continue. He looked around at Sirius
and saw that he had his face in his hands.
Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee. The phoenix had
fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beautiful head against Harry's injured
leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the
spider. The pain vanished. The skin mended. His leg was repaired.
"I will say it again," said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and
resettled itself upon the perch beside the door. "You have shown bravery
beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight. Harry. You have
shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his
powers. You have shouldered a grown wizard's burden and found yourself
equal to it - and you have now given us all we have a right to expect. You will
come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to the
dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace . . . Sirius, would you
like to stay with him?"
Sirius nodded and stood up. He transformed back into the great black dog and
walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them
down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.
When Dumbledore pushed open the door. Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron,
and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They
appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to
him. All of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream.
"Harry! Oh Harry!"
She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.
"Molly," he said, holding up a hand, "please listen to me for a moment. Harry
has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me.
What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to
stay with him," he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, "you
may do so. But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer,
and certainly not this evening."
Mrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron, Hermione,
and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, "Did you hear? He needs
quiet!"
"Headmaster," said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black dog that was
Sirius, "may I ask what - ?"
"This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while," said Dumbledore simply.
"I assure you, he is extremely well trained. Harry - I will wait while you get
into bed."
Harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore for asking the
others not to question him. It wasn't as though he didn't want them there; but
the thought of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more time,
was more than he could stand.
"I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry," said
Dumbledore. "I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to
the school." He left.
As Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight of the real
Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room. His wooden leg
and magical eye were lying on the bedside table.
"Is he okay?" Harry asked.
"He'll be fine," said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry some pajamas and pulling
screens around him. He took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into
bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black dog came around the
screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and
Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.
"I'm all right," he told them. "Just tired."
Mrs. Weasleys eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bed-covers
unnecessarily.
Madam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a small
bottle of some purple potion and a goblet.
"You'll need to drink all of this. Harry," she said. "It's a potion for dreamless
sleep."
Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming
drowsy at once. Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the
hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen
around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of
the feather matress. Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep.
Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn't open his eyes, wanting to
drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still nighttime
and had a feeling that he couldn't have been asleep very long.
Then he heard whispering around him.
"They'll wake him if they don't shut up!"
"What are they shouting about? Nothing else can have happened, can it?"
Harry opened his eyes blearily. Someone had removed his glasses. He could
see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs. Weasley and Bill close by. Mrs. Weasley was on
her feet.
"That's Fudge's voice," she whispered. "And that's Minerva McGonagall's, isn't
it? But what are they arguing about?"
Now Harry could hear them too: people shouting and running toward the
hospital wing.
"Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva -" Cornelius Fudge was saying loudly.
"You should never have brought it inside the castle!" yelled Professor
McGonagall. "When Dumbledore finds out -"
Harry heard the hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed by any of the people
around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the
screens, Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.
Fudge came striding up the ward. Professors McGonagall and Snape were at
his heels.
"Where's Dumbledore?" Fudge demanded of Mrs. Weasley.
"He's not here," said Mrs. Weasley angrily. "This is a hospital wing. Minister,
don't you think you'd do better to -"
But the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping up the ward.
"What has happened?" said Dumbledore sharply, looking from Fudge to
Professor McGonagall. "Why are you disturbing these people? Minerva, I'm
surprised at you - I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch -"
"There is no need to stand guard over him anymore, Dumble-dore!" she
shrieked. "The Minister has seen to that!"
Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this. There were
angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and a hands were balled into fists; she was
trembling with fury.-
"When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for
tonight’s events," said Snape, in a low voice; he seemed to feel his personal
safety was in question. He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany
him into the castle. He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch -"
"I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!" McGonagall fumed. "I told
him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but -"
"My dear woman!" roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier than Harry had
ever seen him, "as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring
protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous -"
But Professor McGonagall's voice drowned Fudge's.
"The moment that - that thing entered the room," she screamed, pointing at
Fudge, trembling all over, "it swooped down on Crouch and - and -"
Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find
words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her
sentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its
fatal kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He
was worse than dead.
"By all accounts, he is no loss!" blustered Fudge. "It seems he has been
responsible for several deaths'."
"But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius," said Dumbledore. He was
staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. "He
cannot give evidence about why he killed those people."
"Why he killed them? Well, that's no mystery, is it?" blustered Fudge. "He
was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems
to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who's instructions!"
"Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius," Dumbledore said.
"Those peoples deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to
full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his
body."
Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face.
Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn't quite
believe what he had just heard. He began to sputter, still goggling at
Dumbledore.
"You-Know-Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore ..."
"As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you," said Dumbledore, "we
heard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us
how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort - learning of his
continued existence from Bertha Jorkins - went to free him from his father and
used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped
Voldemort to return."
"See here, Dumbledore," said Fudge, and Harry was astonished to see a slight
smile dawning on his face, "you - you can't seriously believe that You-KnowWho - back? Come now, come now . . . certainly, Crouch may have believed
himself to be acting upon You-Know-Who's orders - but to take the word of a
lunatic like that, Dumbledore ..."
"When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to
Voldemort," said Dumbledore steadily. "He witnessed Lord Voldemort’s
rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office."
Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake, but shook his
head and said, "I am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight."
Fudge's curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at
Dumbledore, and said, "You are - er - prepared to take Harry's word on this,
are you, Dumbledore?"
There was a moment's silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His
hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.
"Certainly, I believe Harry," said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. "I
heard Crouch's confession, and I heard Harry's account of what happened after
he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain
everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer."
Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at Harry
before answering.
"You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of
a lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well..."
Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.
"You've been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge," he said quietly.
Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of them had realized
that Harry was awake.
Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.
"And if I have?" he said, looking at Dumbledore. "If I have discovered that
you've been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh?
And having funny turns all over the place -"
"I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his
scar?" said Dumbledore coolly.
"You admit that he has been having these pains, then?" said Fudge quickly.
"Headaches? Nightmares? Possibly - hallucinations?"
"Listen to me, Cornelius," said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and
once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had
felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch. "Harry is as sane as you or
I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him
when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous."
Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less
stubborn.
"You'll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I've never heard of a curse scar acting as
an alarm bell before. ..."
"Look, I saw Voldemort come back!" Harry shouted. He tried to get out of bed
again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. "I saw the Death Eaters! I can give
you their names! Lucius Malfoy -"
Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape’s eyes flew
back to Fudge.
"Malfoy was cleared!" said Fudge, visibly affronted. "A very old family -
donations to excellent causes -"
"Macnair!" Harry continued.
"Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!"
"Avery - Nott - Crabbe - Goyle -"
"You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being
Death Eaters thirteen years ago!" said Fudge angrily. "You could have found
those names in old reports of the trials! For heavens sake, Dumbledore - the
boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too - his tales are
getting taller, and you're still swallowing them - the boy can talk to snakes.
Dumbledore, and you still think he's trustworthy?"
"You fool!" Professor McGonagall cried. "Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch!
These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!"
"I see no evidence to the contrary!" shouted Fudge, now matching her anger,
his face purpling. "It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic
that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!"
Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of Fudge
as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially goodnatured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank,
to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world - to
believe that Voldemort could have risen.
"Voldemort has returned," Dumbledore repeated. "If you accept that fact
straightaway. Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to
save the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from
the control of the dementors -"
"Preposterous!" shouted Fudge again. "Remove the dementors? I'd be kicked
out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night
because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!"
"The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have
put Lord Voldemort's most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who
will join him the instant he asks them!" said Dumbledore. "They will not
remain loyal to you, Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for
their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind him,
and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed to stop him
regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!"
Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his
outrage.
"The second step you must take - and at once," Dumbledore pressed on, "is to
send envoys to the giants."
"Envoys to the giants?" Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. "What
madness is this?"
"Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late," said
Dumbledore, "or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone
among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!"
"You - you cannot be serious!" Fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating
further from Dumbledore. "If the magical community got wind that I had
approached the giants - people hate them, Dumbledore - end of my career -"
"You are blinded," said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power
around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, "by the love of the office you
hold, Cornelius! You place too much importance, and you always have done,
on the so-called purity of blood! You fail to recognize that it matters not what
someone is born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has just destroyed
the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any - and see what
that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now- take the steps I have
suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest
and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known. Fail to act - and history
will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a
second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!"
"Insane," whispered Fudge, still backing away. "Mad . . ."
And then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of
Harry's bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs.Weasley was still standing over
Harry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising. Bill, Ron, and
Hermione were staring at Fudge.
"If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this,
Cornelius," said Dumbledore, "we have reached a parting of the ways. You
must act as you see fit. And I - I shall act as I see fit."
Dumbledore's voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a mere statement,
but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were advancing upon him with a
wand.
"Now, see here, Dumbledore," he said, waving a threatening finger. "I've given
you free rein, always. I've had a lot of respect for you. I might not have agreed
with some of your decisions, but I've kept quiet. There aren't many who'd have
let you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students
without reference to the Ministry. But if you're going to work against me -"
"The only one against whom I intend to work," said Dumbledore, "is Lord
Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same
side."
It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked backward and
forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands.
Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, "He can't be back,
Dumbledore, he just can't be ..."
Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes
as he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.
"There," said Snape harshly. "There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it
was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every
Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of
distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he
touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate,
instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff s
too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn.
We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance. He
betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into
the fold."
Fudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking his head. He did not
seem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled by
the ugly mark on Snape's arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, "I
don't know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have
heard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow,
Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the
Ministry."
He had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned around, strode
back down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry's bed.
"Your winnings," he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket
and dropping it onto Harrys bedside table. "One thousand Galleons. There
should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances .. ."
He crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room,
slamming the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore
turned to look at the group around Harry's bed.
"There is work to be done," he said. "Molly... am I right in thinking that I can
count on you and Arthur?"
"Of course you can," said Mrs. Weasley. She was white to the lips, but she
looked resolute. "We know what Fudge is. It's Arthur's fondness for Muggles
that has held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks
proper wizarding pride."
"Then I need to send a message to Arthur," said Dumbledore. "All those that
we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well placed
to contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius."
"I'll go to Dad," said Bill, standing up. "I'll go now."
"Excellent," said Dumbledore. "Tell him what has happened. Tell him I will
be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If
Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry -"
"Leave it to me," said Bill.
He clapped a hand on Harry's shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek, pulled
on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.
"Minerva," said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, "I want to see
Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also - if she will consent to come -
Madame Maxime."
Professor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.
"Poppy," Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, "would you be very kind and
go down to Professor Moodys office, where I think you will find a house-elf
called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take her
back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us."
"Very - very well," said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left.
Dumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that Madam Pomfrey's
footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.
"And now," he said, "it is time for two of our number to recognize each other
for what they are. Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form."
The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back
into a man.
Mrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.
"Sirius Black!" she shrieked, pointing at him.
"Mum, shut up!" Ron yelled. "It's okay!"
Snape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his face was one of
mingled fury and horror.
"Him!" he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal dislike. "What is
he doing here?"
"He is here at my invitation," said Dumbledore, looking between them, "as are
you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old
differences and trust each other."
Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle. Sirius and Snape
were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing.
"I will settle, in the short term," said Dumbledore, with a bite of impatience in
his voice, "for a lack of open hostility. You will shake hands. You are on the
same side now. Time is short, and unless the few of us who know the truth do
not stand united, there is no hope
for any us.
Very slowly - but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other
nothing but ill - Sirius and Snape moved toward each other and shook hands.
They let go extremely quickly.
"That will do to be going on with," said Dumbledore, stepping between them
once more. "Now I have work for each of you. Fudge's attitude, though not
unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are
to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher - the old crowd. Lie
low at Lupin's for a while; I will contact you there."
"But -" said Harry.
He wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to have to say goodbye again so
quickly.
"You'll see me very soon. Harry," said Sirius, turning to him. "I promise you.
But I must do what I can, you understand, don't you?"
"Yeah," said Harry. "Yeah . . . of course I do."
Sirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, transformed again into
the black dog, and ran the length of the room to the door, whose handle he
turned with a paw. Then he was gone.
"Severus," said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, "you know what I must ask you
to do. If you are ready . . . if you are prepared ..."
"I am," said Snape.
He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.
"Then good luck," said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of
apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.
It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.
"I must go downstairs," he said finally. "I must see the Diggorys. Harry - take
the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later."
Harry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared.
Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him. None of them
spoke for a very long time.
"You've got to take the rest of your potion. Harry," Mrs. Weasley said at last.
Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the
bottle and the goblet. "You have a good long sleep. Try and think about
something else for a while . . . think about what you're going to buy with your
winnings!"
"I don't want that gold," said Harry in an expressionless voice. "You have it.
Anyone can have it. I shouldn't have won it. It should've been Cedric's."
The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come
out of the maze was threatening to overpower him. He could feel a burning,
prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at
the ceiling.
"It wasn't your fault. Harry," Mrs. Weasley whispered.
"I told him to take the cup with me," said Harry.
Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron would look
away.
Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put
her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as
though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night
seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother s face,
his father's voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in
his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against
the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.
There was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry broke apart.
Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her
hand.
"Sorry," she whispered.
"Your potion, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley quickly, wiping her eyes on the back
of her hand.
Harry drank it in one gulp. The effect was instantaneous. Heavy, irresistible
waves of dreamless sleep broke over him; he fell back onto his pillows and
thought no more.
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN – THE BEGINNING
When he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he had only scattered
memories of the next few days. It was as though he had been through too much
to take in any more. The recollections he did have were very painful. The
worst, perhaps, was the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following
morning.
They did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked
him for returning Cedric's body to them. Mr. Diggory sobbed through most of
the interview. Mrs. Diggory's grief seemed to be beyond tears.
"He suffered very little then," she said, when Harry had told her how Cedric had
died. "And after all, Amos ... he died just when he'd won the tournament. He
must have been happy."
When they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry and said, "You look after
yourself, now."
Harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.
"You take this," he muttered to her. "It should've been Cedric's, he got there
first, you take it -"
But she backed away from him.
"Oh no, it's yours, dear, I couldn't. . . you keep it."
Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening. From what
Hermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the school that
morning at breakfast. He had merely requested that they leave Harry alone,
that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had
happened in the maze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the
corridors, avoiding his eyes. Some whispered behind their hands as he passed.
He guessed that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter's article about how
disturbed and possibly dangerous he was. Perhaps they were formulating their
own theories about how Cedric had died. He found he didn't care very much.
He liked it best when he was with Ron and Hermione and they were talking
about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess. He
felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didn't need to
put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of what was
going on outside Hogwarts - and that it was useless to speculate about what
might be coming until they knew anything for certain. The only time they
touched upon the subject was when Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs.
Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.
"She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer," he said.
"But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first."
"Why?" said Harry.
"She said Dumbledore's got his reasons," said Ron, shaking his head darkly. "I
suppose we've got to trust him, haven't we?"
The only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt able to talk to
was Hagrid. As there was no longer a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,
they had those lessons free. They used the one on Thursday afternoon to go
down and visit Hagrid in his cabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang
bounded out of the open door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail
madly.
"Who's that?" called Hagrid, coming to the door. "Harry!"
He strode out to meet them, pulled Harry into a one-armed hug, ruffled his hair,
and said, "Good ter see yeh, mate. Good ter see yeh."
They saw two bucket-size cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the
fireplace when they entered Hagrid's cabin.
"Bin havin' a cuppa with Olympe," Hagrid said. "She's jus' left."
"Who?" said Ron curiously.
"Madame Maxime, o' course!" said Hagrid.
"You two made up, have you?" said Ron.
"Dunno what yeh're talkin' about," said Hagrid airily, fetching more cups from
the dresser. When he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy
cookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed Harry closely through his
beetle-black eyes.
"You all righ'?" he said gruffly
"Yeah," said Harry.
"No, yeh're not," said Hagrid. "Course yeh're not. But yeh will be."
Harry said nothing.
"Knew he was goin' ter come back," said Hagrid, and Harry, Ron, and
Hermione looked up at him, shocked. "Known it fer years. Harry. Knew he
was out there, bidin' his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has, an' we'll jus'
have ter get on with it. We'll fight. Migh' be able ter stop him before he gets a
good hold. That's Dumbledores plan, anyway. Great man, Dumbledore. 'S
long as we've got him, I'm not too worried."
Hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces.
"No good sittin' worryin' abou' it," he said. "What's comin' will come, an we'll
meet it when it does. Dumbledore told me wha' you did. Harry."
Hagrid's chest swelled as he looked at Harry.
"Yeh did as much as yer father would've done, an' I can' give yeh no higher
praise than that."
Harry smiled back at him. It was the first time he'd smiled in days. "What's
Dumbledore asked you to do, Hagrid?" he asked. "He sent Professor
McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him - that night."
"Got a little job fer me over the summer," said Hagrid. "Secret, though. I'm not
s'pposed ter talk abou' it, no, not even ter you lot. Olympe - Madame Maxime
ter you - might be comin' with me. I think she will. Think I got her persuaded."
"Is it to do with Voldemort?"
Hagrid flinched at the sound of the name.
"Migh' be," he said evasively. "Now . . . who'd like ter come an' visit the las'
skrewt with me? I was jokin' - jokin'!" he added hastily, seeing the looks on
their faces.
It was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the
night before his return to Privet Drive. He was dreading the Leaving Feast,
which was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the Inter-House
Championship would be announced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall
when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when
it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students.
When he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the usual
decorations were missing. The Great Hall was normally decorated with the
winning House's colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight, however, there were
black drapes on the wall behind the teachers' table. Harry knew instantly that
they were there as a mark of respect to Cedric.
The real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his
magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy, jumping every time
someone spoke to him. Harry couldn't blame him; Moodys fear of attack was
bound to have been increased by his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk.
Professor Karkaroff s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down with
the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had
caught up with him.
Madame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid. They were
talking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting next to Professor
McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment as Harry
looked at him. His expression was difficult to read. He looked as sour and
unpleasant as ever. Harry continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked
away.
What was it that Snape had done on Dumbledores orders, the night that
Voldemort had returned? And why. . . why . . . was Dumbledore so convinced
that Snape was truly on their side? He had been their spy, Dumbledore had said
so in the Pensieve. Snape had turned spy against Voldemort, "at great personal
risk." Was that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact with the
Death Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone over to
Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself, biding his time?
Harry's musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff
table. The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was
at the Leaving Feast, became very quiet.
"The end," said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, "of another year."
He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs had been the
most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the
saddest and palest faces in the Hall.
"There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight," said Dumbledore,
"but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be
sitting here," he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, "enjoying our feast with us. I
would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory."
They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and
raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, "Cedric
Diggory."
Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were tears pouring
silently down her face. He looked down at the table as they all sat down again.
"Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish
Hufflepuff house," Dumbledore continued. "He was a good and loyal friend, a
hard worker, he valued fair play. His death has affected you all, whether you
knew him well or not. I think that you have the right, therefore, to know
exactly how it came about."
Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.
"Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort."
A panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at Dumbledore
in disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter
themselves into silence.
"The Ministry of Magic," Dumbledore continued, "does not wish me to tell you
this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so
- either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or
because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief,
however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to
pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of
his own, is an insult to his memory."
Stunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned toward Dumbledore
now... or almost every face. Over at the Slytherin table. Harry saw Draco
Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle. Harry felt a hot, sick swoop
of anger in his stomach. He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.
"There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedrics
death," Dumbledore went on. "I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter."
A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in Harry's
direction before flicking back to face Dumbledore.
"Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort," said Dumbledore. "He
risked his own life to return Cedric's body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every
respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord
Voldemort, and for this, I honor him."
Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more. Nearly
everyone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as they
had murmured Cedric's, and drank to him. But through a gap in the standing
figures. Harry saw that Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other
Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched.
Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.
When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued,
"The Triwizard Tournament's aim was to further and promote magical
understanding. In the light of what has happened - of Lord Voldemorts return -
such ties are more important than ever before."
Dumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to Fleur Delacour and
her fellow Beauxbatons students, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the
Slytherin table. Krum, Harry saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though
he expected Dumbledore to say something harsh.
"Every guest in this Hall," said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the
Durmstrang students, "will be welcomed back here at any time, should they
wish to come. I say to you all, once again - in the light of Lord Voldemort's
return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord
Voldemorts gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it
only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of
habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are
open.
"It is my belief- and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken - that we are all
facing dark and difficult times. Some of you in this Hall have already suffered
directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn
asunder. A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.
"Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to
make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what
happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed
across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory."
Harry's trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it. He, Ron,
and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the
fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade station.
It was another beautiful summer's day. He supposed that Privet Drive would be
hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that evening.
The thought gave him no pleasure at all.
"'Arry!"
He looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the
castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds. Harry could see Hagrid helping
Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The
Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.
"We will see each uzzer again, I 'ope," said Fleur as she reached him, holding
out her hand. "I am 'oping to get a job 'ere, to improve my Eenglish."
"It's very good already," said Ron in a strangled sort of voice. Fleur smiled at
him; Hermione scowled.
“Good-bye, 'Arry," said Fleur, turning to go. "It 'az been a pleasure meeting
you!"
Harrys spirits couldn't help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur hurry back
across the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight.
Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back," said Ron. “D' you
reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff?"
“Karkaroff did not steer," said a gruff voice. "He stayed in his cabin and let us
do the vork."
Krum had come to say good-bye to Hermione. "Could I have a vord?" he
asked her.
“Oh . . . yes ... all right," said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and
following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
"You'd better hurry up!" Ron called loudly after her. "The carriages'll be here
in a minute!"
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few
minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and
Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione,
but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory," said Krum abruptly to Harry. "He vos alvays polite to me.
Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang - with Karkaroff," he added,
scowling.
“Have you got a new headmaster yet?" said Harry
Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry's hand,
and then Ron's. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful
internal struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron burst out,
"Can I have your autograph?"
Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now
trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified,
signed a fragment of parchment for Ron.
The weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King's
Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September. There
wasn't a single cloud in the sky. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had managed to get
a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under Rons
dress robes to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig was dozing, her head
under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large,
furry ginger cushion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked more fully and freely
than they had all week as the train sped them southward. Harry felt as though
Dumbledore's speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow. It
was less painful to discuss what had happened now. They broke off their
conversation about what action Dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop
Voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived.
When Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her
schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet that she had been
carrying in there. Harry looked at it, unsure whether he really wanted to know
what it might say, but Hermione, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, "There's
nothing in there. You can look for yourself, but there's nothing at all. I've been
checking every day. Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you
won the tournament. They didn't even mention Cedric. Nothing about any of
it. If you ask me. Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet."
"He'll never keep Rita quiet," said Harry. "Not on a story like this."
"Oh, Rita hasn't written anything at all since the third task," said Hermione in
an oddly constrained voice. "As a matter of fact," she added, her voice now
trembling slightly, "Rita Skeeter isn't going to be writing anything at all for a
while. Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her."
"What are you talking about?" said Ron.
"I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn't
supposed to be coming onto the grounds," said Hermione in a rush.
Harry had the impression that Hermione had been dying to tell them this for
days, but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had
happened.
"How was she doing it?" said Harry at once.
"How did you find out?" said Ron, staring at her.
"Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea. Harry," she said.
"Did I?" said Harry, perplexed. "How?"
"Bugging," said Hermione happily.
"But you said they didn't work -"
"Oh not electronic bugs," said Hermione. "No, you see ... Rita Skeeter" -
Hermiones voice trembled with quiet triumph - "is an unregistered Animagus.
She can turn -"
Hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out other bag.
"- into a beetle."
"You're kidding," said Ron. "You haven't.. . she's not..."
"Oh yes she is," said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them.
Inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle.
"That's never - you're kidding -" Ron whispered, lifting the jar to his eyes.
"No, I'm not," said Hermione, beaming. "I caught her on the windowsill in the
hospital wing. Look very closely, and you'll notice the markings around her
antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears."
Harry looked and saw that she was quite right. He also remembered something.
"There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame
Maxime about his mum!"
"Exactly," said Hermione. "And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after
we'd had our conversation by the lake. And unless I'm very much mistaken,
Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar
hurt. She's been buzzing around for stories all year."
"When we saw Malfoy under that tree ..." said Ron slowly.
"He was talking to her, in his hand," said Hermione. "He knew, of course.
That's how she's been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins.
They wouldn't care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were
giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid."
Hermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the beetle, which
buzzed angrily against the glass.
"I've told her I'll let her out when we get back to London," said Hermione. "I've
put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can't transform. And I've
told her she's to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can't break
the habit of writing horrible lies about people."
Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag.
The door of the compartment slid open.
"Very clever. Granger," said Draco Malfoy.
Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them looked more
pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had
ever seen them.
"So," said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking
slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. "You caught some
pathetic reporter, and Potter's Dumbledore's favorite boy again. Big deal."
His smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.
"Trying not to think about it, are we?" said Malfoy softly, looking around at all
three of them. "Trying to pretend it hasn't happened?"
"Get out," said Harry.
He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to
Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledores speech about Cedric. He could feel a
kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes.
"You've picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to
choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train,
first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!" He
jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. "Too late now. Potter! They'll be the first
to go, now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well -
second - Diggory was the f-"
It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the
compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every
direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at the
floor.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He,
Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different
hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.
"Thought we'd see what those three were up to," said Fred matter-of-factly,
stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so
did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.
"Interesting effect," said George, looking down at Crabbe. "Who used the
Furnunculus Curse?"
"Me," said Harry.
"Odd," said George lightly. "I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two
shouldn't be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face.
Well, let's not leave them here, they don't add much to the decor."
Ron, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle - each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of
jinxes with which they had been hit - out into the corridor, then came back into
the compartment and rolled the door shut.
"Exploding Snap, anyone?" said Fred, pulling out a pack of cards.
They were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask them.
"You going to tell us, then?" he said to George. "Who you were
blackmailing?"
"Oh," said George darkly. "That."
"It doesn't matter," said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. "It wasn't anything
important. Not now, anyway."
"We've given up," said George, shrugging.
But Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, "All
right, all right, if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman."
"Bagman?" said Harry sharply. "Are you saying he was involved in –“
"Nah," said George gloomily. "Nothing like that. Stupid git. He wouldn't have
the brains."
"Well, what, then?" said Ron.
Fred hesitated, then said, "You remember that bet we had with him at the
Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get the
Snitch?"
"Yeah," said Harry and Ron slowly.
"Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he'd caught from the Irish mascots."
"So?"
"So," said Fred impatiently, "it vanished, didn't it? By next morning, it had
gone!"
"But - it must've been an accident, mustn't it?" said Hermione.
George laughed very bitterly.
"Yeah, that's what we thought, at first. We thought if we just wrote to him, and
told him he'd made a mistake, he'd cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored our
letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always
making some excuse to get away from us."
"In the end, he turned pretty nasty," said Fred. "Told us we were too young to
gamble, and he wasn't giving us anything."
"So we asked for our money back," said George glowering.
"He didn't refuse!" gasped Hermione.
"Right in one," said Fred.
"But that was all your savings!" said Ron.
"Tell me about it," said George. "'Course, we found out what was going on in
the end. Lee Jordan's dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as
well. Turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off
them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took
all the gold he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts. They
followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He's lost
everything gambling. Hasn't got two Galleons to rub together. And you know
how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?"
"How?" said Harry.
"He put a bet on you, mate," said Fred. "Put a big bet on you to win the
tournament. Bet against the goblins."
"So that's why he kept trying to help me win!" said Harry. "Well - I did win,
didn't I? So he can pay you your gold!"
"Nope," said George, shaking his head. "The goblins play as dirty as him.
They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you'd win outright.
So Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after the third task."
George sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again.
The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have
gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King's Cross . . .
but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when
something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was
pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual confusion and noise
filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and Hermione
struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying their trunks. Harry,
however, stayed put.
"Fred - George - wait a moment."
The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard
winnings.
"Take it," he said, and he thrust the sack into George's hands.
"What?" said Fred, looking flabbergasted.
"Take it," Harry repeated firmly. "I don't want it."
"You're mental," said George, trying to push it back at Harry.
"No, I'm not," said Harry. "You take it, and get inventing. It's for the joke
shop."
"He is mental," Fred said in an almost awed voice.
"Listen," said Harry firmly. "If you don't take it, I'm throwing it down the
drain. I don't want it and I don't need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We
could all do with a few laughs. I've got a feeling we're going to need them more
than usual before long."
"Harry," said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, "there's got
to be a thousand Galleons in here."
"Yeah," said Harry, grinning. "Think how many Canary Creams that is."
The twins stared at him.
"Just don't tell your mum where you got it... although she might not be so keen
for you to join the Ministry anymore, come to think of it. . . ."
"Harry," Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.
"Look," he said flatly, "take it, or I'll hex you. I know some good ones now.
Just do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say
they're from you."
He left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex
marks.
Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs. Weasley was close by him.
She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, "I
think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. Keep in touch,
Harry."
"See you. Harry," said Ron, clapping him on the back.
"'Bye, Harry!" said Hermione, and she did something she had never done
before, and kissed him on the cheek.
"Harry - thanks," George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side.
Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently from
the station. There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the
back of the Dursleys' car.
As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come ... and he would have to
meet it when it did.

1
chapter one
The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close
and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet
Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives
and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing;
the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of
their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants
of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze.
The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on
his back in a flower bed outside number four.
He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the
pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a
short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy
and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors,
who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea
bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only
dudley demented
2
chapter one
way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia
stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight
down into the flower bed below.
On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his
idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on
the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or
shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had
tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his
aunt and uncle.
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the
boy’s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he anyway?”
“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not in the
house.”
Uncle Vernon grunted.
“Watching the news . . .” he said scathingly. “I’d like to know what
he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what’s on the news — Dudley hasn’t got a clue what’s going on, doubt he knows who the Prime
Minister is! Anyway, it’s not as if there’d be anything about his lot on
our news —”
“Vernon, shh!” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s open!”
“Oh — yes — sorry, dear . . .”
The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N
Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving
old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was
frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was
concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking
him around for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had
rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s
voice floated out of the window again.

dudley demented
“Dudders out for tea?”
“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got so many little friends, he’s so popular . . .”
Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his
dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that
Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every
evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and
throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at
it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent
most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers
from bins along the way.
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o’clock
news reached Harry’s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps
tonight — after a month of waiting — would be the night —
“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the
Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike reaches its second week —”
“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle Vernon over the
end of the newsreader’s sentence, but no matter: Outside in the flower
bed, Harry’s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened,
it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers. . . .
He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky.
Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and
always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet. . . .
He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not
recognized for what it really was by the Muggles — an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident . . . but the
4
chapter one
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the drought in the
Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon,
“with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter
that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress’s divorce from her famous husband (“as if we’re interested in their sordid
affairs,” sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively
in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).
Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the
newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel
way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find
out more. . . .”
Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing
budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows,
preparing to crawl out from under the window.
He had moved about two inches when several things happened in
very quick succession.
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat
streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a
bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this
signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a
sword. But before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of
his head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and the resultant
crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.
Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, he
swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise,
but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple
hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around
his throat.

dudley demented
“Put — it — away!” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s ear. “Now!
Before — anyone — sees!”
“Get — off— me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage-like fingers with his left
hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as
the pain in the top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an
electric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through
his nephew, making him impossible to hold.
Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened
up, and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud
cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans
and tried to look innocent.
“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number
Seven, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. “Did you hear
that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!”
He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious
neighbors had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin
became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him.
Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the
point at which Uncle Vernon’s outstretched hands could resume their
strangling.
“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle Vernon in a
croaky voice that trembled with fury.
“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept looking left
and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made
the cracking noise.
“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our —”
“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly.
Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon’s wide, purple one. She looked livid.
6
chapter one
“Why were you lurking under our window?”
“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our
window, boy?”
“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned voice.
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.
“Listening to the news! Again?”
“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry.
“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you’re really up to — and don’t give me any more of this listening to the news
tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot. . .”
“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, “. . . that your lot
don’t get on our news!”
“That’s all you know,” said Harry.
The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia
said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are all those —” she too lowered
her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, “— owls —
doing if they’re not bringing you news?”
“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. “Get out of that
one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!”
Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the
truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly
know how bad Harry felt at admitting it.
“The owls . . . aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry tonelessly.
“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once.
“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.
“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt Petunia.
“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon.
“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper rising, and before
the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the
7
dudley demented
front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up
the street.
He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his
aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not
care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind.
Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone
Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the
house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right
at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and
stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to
become invisible. . . .
He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had
pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his
shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt
Petunia’s dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to
him, why hadn’t they made contact, why were they hiding now?
And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked
away.
Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so
desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he
belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises.
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor’s house?
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and, before he
knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer
rolled over him once again. . . .
Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five
8
chapter one
o’clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet —
but was there any point in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced
at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots
who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was back it would
be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about.
If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his
best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had
that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.
“We can’t say much about you-know-what, obviously. ...” “We’ve been
told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray. ...”
“We’re quite busy but I can’t give you details here. . . .” “There’s a fair
amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see you. ...”
But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled, “I expect we’ll be
seeing you quite soon” inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon?
As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron’s parents’
house. He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun
at the Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so
angry at them that he had thrown both their birthday presents of
Honeydukes chocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this
after eating the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner
that night.
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn’t he,
Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself capable of handling much
more than they? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it
been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed . . . ?
Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth
time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments
too.

dudley demented
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he
passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had
first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty
of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at least they contained
words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints:
“I know this must be frustrating for you. ...” “Keep your nose clean
and everything will be okay. ...” “Be careful and don’t do anything
rash. ...”
Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into
Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had
(by and large) done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the Burrow
by himself. In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good
considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing.
Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man
who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped,
attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the
first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . .
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the
parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets.
When he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley
and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to
hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed again. Tomorrow he would have to
think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he
had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night,
because even when he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and
locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the
10
chapter one
trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his
forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that
Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting anymore. . . . In the past his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was
getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would
probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected. . . . Nothing to worry about . . . old news . . .
The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell
with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, nobody would even have known
Voldemort was back! And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world,
reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear
about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without
inviting him along too? How much longer was he supposed to endure
Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry’s
head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell
around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only
sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park
railings.
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the
sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong
enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the
park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were
laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing
bikes that they were wheeling along.
Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang.
11
dudley demented
Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As
Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had
recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it,
had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry
in the primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s first
punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore
but he still didn’t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and
more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all
around were terrified of him — even more terrified than they were of
“that Potter boy,” who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal
Boys.
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered
whom they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found
himself thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I’m
sitting here all alone.... Come and have a go.. . .
If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to
make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He
wouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of
provoking Harry. . . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond
. . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he
had his wand . . . let them try . . . He’d love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell —
But they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them.
. . . Seeking a fight was not a smart move. . . . He must not use
magic. . . . He would be risking expulsion again. . . .
Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along
Magnolia Road.
12
chapter one
There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my
nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done . . .
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon
seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to
be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley
again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the park
gate.
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses
with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners
who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred
Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches
of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along
Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into view again; they were saying
their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped
into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.
“. . . squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was saying, to guffaws
from the others.
“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers.
“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley.
“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon.
“See you then,” said Dudley.
“Bye Dud!”
“See ya, Big D!”
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off
again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the
corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon
came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his
ease, humming tunelessly.
“Hey, Big D!”
13
dudley demented
Dudley turned.
“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.”
“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry.
“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again.
“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his
cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.”
“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled
into fists.
“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?”
“Shut your face.”
“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about ‘popkin’ and
‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?”
Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting
Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control.
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin
fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights
ago —”
“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley.
“Oh yeah?”
“He cheeked me.”
“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on
its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true . . .”
A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry enormous
satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as
though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the
only outlet he had.
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had
first seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the
streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps
were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on
the other.
14
chapter one
“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley
said after a few seconds.
“What thing?”
“That — that thing you’re hiding.”
Harry grinned again.
“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose if you were,
you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at the same time. . . .”
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.
“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not.
You’d get expelled from that freak school you go to.”
“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?”
“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound completely
convinced. Harry laughed softly.
“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have
you?” Dudley snarled.
“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat
up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on
about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?”
“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled Dudley, “and he was
out cold for twenty minutes after I’d finished with him and he was
twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing
out —”
“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry’s wand?”
“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley.
“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when it goes all
dark like this.”
“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.
From the little he could see of Dudley’s large face, he was wearing a
strangely triumphant look.
“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, completely
15
dudley demented
nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or
something?”
“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. “Talking in your
sleep. Moaning.”
“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night
in his dreams.
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched,
whimpering voice. “‘Don’t kill Cedric! Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s
Cedric — your boyfriend?”
“I — you’re lying —” said Harry automatically. But his mouth had
gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — how else would he know
about Cedric?
“‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo-hoo!’”
“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m warning you!”
“‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He’s killed
Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to —’ Don’t you point that thing at
me!”
Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand
directly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years’ hatred of
Dudley pounding in his veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now,
to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an insect,
struck dumb, sprouting feelers —
“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. “D’you understand me?”
“Point that thing somewhere else!”
“I said, do you understand me?”
“Point it somewhere else!”
“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”
“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM —”
Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been
doused in icy water.
16
chapter one
Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky
was suddenly pitch-black and lightless — the stars, the moon, the
misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by
total, impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without
meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been resisting as hard as he
could — then his reason caught up with his senses — he didn’t have
the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that,
trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a
weightless veil.
Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear.
“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!”
“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!”
“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I —”
“I said shut up!”
Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The
cold was so intense that he was shivering all over; goose bumps had
erupted up his arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly
around, unseeing . . .
It was impossible. . . . They couldn’t be here. . . . Not in Little
Whinging . . . He strained his ears. . . . He would hear them before
he saw them. . . .
“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? What are
you d-do — ?”
“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis —”
But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been
dreading.
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, some-
17
dudley demented
thing that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.
“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I’ll h-hit you, I swear I will!”
“Dudley, shut —”
WHAM!
A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, lifting Harry off
his feet. Small white lights popped in front of Harry’s eyes; for the
second time in an hour he felt as though his head had been cleaved in
two; next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and his wand
had flown out of his hand.
“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain,
as he scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the
alley fence, stumbling.
“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT
IT!”
There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s footsteps stopped.
At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that
could mean only one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU
DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s —
wand — come on — Lumos!”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in
his search — and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from
his right hand — the wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up,
scrambled to his feet, and turned around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking
on the night as it came.
Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
18
chapter one
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his
feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him,
panic fogging his brain — concentrate —
A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s
robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry’s ears.
“Expecto Patronum!”
His voice sounded dim and distant. . . wisp of silver
smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — he couldn’t do
it anymore, he couldn’t work the spell —
There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter. . . . He could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, filling his own lungs, drowning him — Think . . . something happy. ...
But there was no happiness in him. . . . The dementor’s icy fingers
were closing on his throat — the high-pitched laughter was growing
louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death,
Harry. ... It might even be painless. . . . I would not know. . . . I have
never died. . . .”
He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again —
And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for
breath —
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry’s wand; its
antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have
been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag
charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.
“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he
sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. “DUDLEY?
DUDLEY!”
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley
was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second
19
dudley demented
dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy
hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded
head toward Dudley’s face as though about to kiss him. . . .
“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the
silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The dementor’s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver
antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its
fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag
cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.
Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze
swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry
stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to
normality. After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat.
He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in
Little Whinging . . .
Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking.
Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but
then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising
his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.
Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her
grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string
shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway
out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight, but —
“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if there are
more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!”
20
chapter two
What?” said Harry blankly.
“He left!” said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. “Left to see
someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom!
I told him I’d flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It’s
just lucky I put Mr. Tibbles on the case! But we haven’t got time to
stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble
this is going to cause! I will kill him!”
“But —”
The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what
dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of
them down the alleyway. “You’re — you’re a witch?”
“I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was
I supposed to help you fight off dementors? He left you completely
without cover when I warned him —”
“This bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang on — it
was him! He Disapparated from the front of my house!”
“Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I’d stationed Mr. Tibbles under a car just
in case, and Mr. Tibbles came and warned me, but by the time I got
a peck of owls
21

to your house you’d gone — and now — oh, what’s Dumbledore going to say? You!” she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor.
“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!”
“You know Dumbledore?” said Harry, staring at her.
“Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn’t know Dumbledore?
But come on — I’ll be no help if they come back, I’ve never so much
as Transfigured a teabag —”
She stooped down, seized one of Dudley’s massive arms in her wizened hands, and tugged.
“Get up, you useless lump, get up!”
But Dudley either could not or would not move. He was still on
the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight.
“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and heaved: With
an enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet. Dudley
seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in
their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let
go of him he swayed dangerously.
“Hurry up!” said Mrs. Figg hysterically.
Harry pulled one of Dudley’s massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under his
weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously
around the corner.
“Keep your wand out,” she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria
Walk. “Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there’s going to be hell
to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk
about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery . . . This was
exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of — what’s that at the end of the
street? Oh, it’s just Mr. Prentice. . . . Don’t put your wand away, boy,
don’t I keep telling you I’m no use?”
It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry Dudley along at
the same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but
Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He
22
chapter two
was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his large feet dragging along the
ground.
“Why didn’t you tell me you’re a Squib?” Harry asked Mrs. Figg,
panting with the effort to keep walking. “All those times I came round
your house — why didn’t you say anything?”
“Dumbledore’s orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young. I’m sorry I gave you such a miserable time,
but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they’d thought you
enjoyed it. It wasn’t easy, you know. . . . But oh my word,” she said
tragically, wringing her hands once more, “when Dumbledore hears
about this — how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be
on duty until midnight — where is he? How am I going to tell Dumbledore what’s happened, I can’t Apparate —”
“I’ve got an owl, you can borrow her,” Harry groaned, wondering
whether his spine was going to snap under Dudley’s weight.
“Harry, you don’t understand! Dumbledore will need to act as
quickly as possible, the Ministry have their own ways of detecting
underage magic, they’ll know already, you mark my words —”
“But I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use magic — they’re
going to be more worried what dementors were doing floating around
Wisteria Walk, surely?”
“Oh my dear, I wish it were so but I’m afraid — MUNDUNGUS
FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!”
There was a loud crack and a strong smell of mingled drink and
stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialized right in front of them. He had short bandy legs, long
straggly ginger hair, and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound; he was also clutching a silvery bundle that
Harry recognized at once as an Invisibility Cloak.
“’S’ up, Figgy?” he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dudley. “What ’appened to staying undercover?”
23
a peck of owls
“I’ll give you undercover!” cried Mrs. Figg. “Dementors, you useless,
skiving sneak thief!”
“Dementors?” repeated Mundungus, aghast. “Dementors here?”
“Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!” shrieked Mrs.
Figg. “Dementors attacking the boy on your watch!”
“Blimey,” said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to
Harry and back again. “Blimey, I . . .”
“And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn’t I tell you not to go?
Didn’t I?”
“I — well, I —” Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. “It . . .
it was a very good business opportunity, see . . .”
Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and
whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by
the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.
“Ouch — gerroff— gerroff, you mad old bat! Someone’s gotta tell
Dumbledore!”
“Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of
cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach. “And — it —
had — better — be — you — and — you — can — tell — him —
why — you — weren’t — there — to — help!”
“Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms over his head,
cowering. “I’m going, I’m going!”
And with another loud crack, he vanished.
“I hope Dumbledore murders him!” said Mrs. Figg furiously. “Now
come on, Harry, what are you waiting for?”
Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out
that he could barely walk under Dudley’s bulk. He gave the semiconscious Dudley a heave and staggered onward.
“I’ll take you to the door,” said Mrs. Figg, as they turned into Privet
Drive. “Just in case there are more of them around. . . . Oh my word,
what a catastrophe . . . and you had to fight them off yourself . . . and
24
chapter two
Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs.
. . . Well, it’s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose . . . but the
cat’s among the pixies now . . .”
“So,” Harry panted, “Dumbledore’s . . . been having . . . me
followed?”
“Of course he has,” said Mrs. Figg impatiently. “Did you expect
him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in
June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent. . . . Right
. . . get inside and stay there,” she said as they reached number four. “I
expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.”
“What are you going to do?” asked Harry quickly.
“I’m going straight home,” said Mrs. Figg, staring around the dark
street and shuddering. “I’ll need to wait for more instructions. Just
stay in the house. Good night.”
“Hang on, don’t go yet! I want to know —”
But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping,
string bag clanking.
“Wait!” Harry shouted after her; he had a million questions to ask
anyone who was in contact with Dumbledore; but within seconds
Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted
Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number
four’s garden path.
The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline
grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the
front door.
“Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite — quite — Diddy,
what’s the matter?”
Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his
arm just in time. Dudley swayed for a moment on the spot, his face
pale green, then he opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the
doormat.
25
a peck of owls
“DIDDY! Diddy, what’s the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!”
Harry’s uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus mustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated.
He hurried forward to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick.
“He’s ill, Vernon!”
“What is it, son? What’s happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you
something foreign for tea?”
“Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on
the ground?”
“Hang on — you haven’t been mugged, have you, son?”
Aunt Petunia screamed.
“Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak
to Mummy! What did they do to you?”
In all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which
suited him perfectly. He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and while the Dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and
quietly toward the stairs.
“Who did it, son? Give us names. We’ll get them, don’t worry.”
“Shh! He’s trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy?
Tell Mummy!”
Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his
voice.
“Him.”
Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the
explosion.
“BOY! COME HERE!”
With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot
slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.
The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the
darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he
26
chapter two
was still very green and clammy looking. Uncle Vernon was standing
in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes.
“What have you done to my son?” he said in a menacing growl.
“Nothing,” said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon
wouldn’t believe him.
“What did he do to you, Diddy?” Aunt Petunia said in a quavering
voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley’s leather jacket.
“Was it — was it you-know-what, darling? Did he use — his thing?”
Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.
“I didn’t!” Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and
Uncle Vernon raised his fists. “I didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t
me, it was —”
But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the
kitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon’s head,
it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it
was carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips
of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside
again and off across the garden.
“OWLS!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. “OWLS
AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY
HOUSE!”
But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out
the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his
Adam’s apple.
Dear Mr. Potter,
We have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening
in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle.
The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reason-
27
a peck of owls
able Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.
As you have already received an official warning for a
previous offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform
you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at
the Ministry of Magic at 9 a.m. on August 12th.
Hoping you are well,
Yours sincerely,
improper use of magic office
Ministry of Magic
Harry read the letter through twice. He was only vaguely aware
of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking in the vicinity. Inside his
head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all
over. He was never going back.
He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced,
shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around
Dudley, who was retching again.
Harry’s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry
representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy
your wand. There was only one thing for it. He would have to run —
now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, but he was certain
of one thing: At Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an
almost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the
kitchen.
28
chapter two
“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle Vernon. When
Harry didn’t reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall. “I haven’t finished with you, boy!”
“Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly.
“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son —”
“If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you,” said Harry,
raising the wand.
“You can’t pull that one on me!” snarled Uncle Vernon. “I know
you’re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!”
“The madhouse has chucked me out,” said Harry. “So I can do
whatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. One — two —”
A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia screamed,
Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night
Harry was staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made.
He spotted it at once: A dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed
window.
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed
the room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl
stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook
its feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled off the letter.
Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.
Harry —
Dumbledore’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s trying
to sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND
UNCLE’S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC.
DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND.
29
a peck of owls
Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out. . . . What did that mean?
How much power did Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of
Magic? Was there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hogwarts, then? A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry’s chest, almost
immediately strangled by panic — how was he supposed to refuse to
surrender his wand without doing magic? He’d have to duel with the
Ministry representatives, and if he did that, he’d be lucky to escape
Azkaban, let alone expulsion.
His mind was racing. . . . He could run for it and risk being captured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait for them to find him here.
He was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew that
Mr. Weasley had his best interests at heart . . . and, after all, Dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before. . . .
“Right,” Harry said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m staying.”
He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley
and Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt
change of mind. Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon.
The vein in Uncle Vernon’s purple temple was throbbing worse than
ever.
“Who are all these ruddy owls from?” he growled.
“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,” said
Harry calmly; he was straining his ears to catch noises outside in case
the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and
quieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s questions than to have him start raging and bellowing. “The second one was from my friend Ron’s dad, he
works at the Ministry.”
“Ministry of Magic?” bellowed Uncle Vernon. “People like you in
government? Oh this explains everything, everything, no wonder the
country’s going to the dogs. . . .”
When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then
spat, “And why have you been expelled?”
30
chapter two
“Because I did magic.”
“AHA!” roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on the top of
the fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley’s low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor. “So you admit it! What did you do to
Dudley?”
“Nothing,” said Harry, slightly less calmly. “That wasn’t me —”
“Was,” muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and
Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quiet him
while they both bent low over Dudley.
“Go on, son,” said Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?”
“Tell us, darling,” whispered Aunt Petunia.
“Pointed his wand at me,” Dudley mumbled.
“Yeah, I did, but I didn’t use —” Harry began angrily, but . . .
“SHUT UP!” roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison. “Go on, son,” repeated Uncle Vernon, mustache blowing about
furiously.
“All dark,” Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. “Everything dark.
And then I h-heard . . . things. Inside m-my head . . .”
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror.
If their least favorite thing in the world was magic, closely followed
by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban,
people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind.
“What sort of things did you hear, popkin?” breathed Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.
But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and
shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that
had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain
curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of
their life. . . . What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have
been forced to hear?
“How come you fell over, son?” said Uncle Vernon in an unnatu-
31
a peck of owls
rally quiet voice, the kind of voice he would adopt at the bedside of a
very ill person.
“T-tripped,” said Dudley shakily. “And then —”
He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: Dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you.
“Horrible,” croaked Dudley. “Cold. Really cold.”
“Okay,” said Uncle Vernon in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt
Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley’s forehead to feel his temperature. “What happened then, Dudders?”
“Felt . . . felt . . . felt . . . as if . . . as if . . .”
“As if you’d never be happy again,” Harry supplied tonelessly.
“Yes,” Dudley whispered, still trembling.
“So,” said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable
volume as he straightened up. “So you put some crackpot spell on my
son so he’d hear voices and believe he was — was doomed to misery,
or something, did you?”
“How many times do I have to tell you?” said Harry, temper and
voice rising together. “It wasn’t me! It was a couple of dementors!”
“A couple of — what’s this codswallop?”
“De — men — tors,” said Harry slowly and clearly. “Two of
them.”
“And what the ruddy hell are dementors?”
“They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,” said Aunt Petunia.
Two seconds’ ringing silence followed these words and then Aunt
Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip
a disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry’s
brain reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing — but Aunt Petunia?
“How d’you know that?” he asked her, astonished.
Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at
Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to
reveal her horsey teeth.
32
chapter two
“I heard — that awful boy — telling her about them — years ago,”
she said jerkily.
“If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use their names?”
said Harry loudly, but Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed horribly flustered.
Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the course
of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry’s mother had been
a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister. He was astounded
that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical
world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into pretending it didn’t exist.
Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once
more, shut it, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk,
opened it for a third time and croaked, “So — so — they — er —
they — er — they actually exist, do they — er — dementy-whatsits?”
Aunt Petunia nodded.
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if
hoping somebody was going to shout “April Fool!” When nobody did,
he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find
more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which
zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball
and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the
Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking
envelope from the owl’s beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped
back out into the night.
“Enough — effing — owls. . .” muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again.
Dear Mr. Potter,
Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes
ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy
your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your
33
a peck of owls
disciplinary hearing on 12th August, at which time an official
decision will be taken.
Following discussions with the headmaster of Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed
that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that
time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from
school pending further inquiries.
With best wishes,
Yours sincerely,
improper use of magic office
Ministry of Magic
Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The
miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that he
was not definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of
August.
“Well?” said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his surroundings.
“What now? Have they sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have
the death penalty?” he added as a hopeful afterthought.
“I’ve got to go to a hearing,” said Harry.
“And they’ll sentence you there?”
“I suppose so.”
“I won’t give up hope, then,” said Uncle Vernon nastily.
“Well, if that’s all,” said Harry, getting to his feet. He was desperate
to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione, or
Sirius.
“NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!” bellowed Uncle Vernon.
“SIT BACK DOWN!”
34
chapter two
“What now?” said Harry impatiently.
“DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon. “I want to know exactly what
happened to my son!”
“FINE!” yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold sparks shot
out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand. All three Dursleys flinched, looking terrified.
“Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent
and Wisteria Walk,” said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control
his temper. “Dudley thought he’d be smart with me, I pulled out my
wand but didn’t use it. Then two dementors turned up —”
“But what ARE dementoids?” asked Uncle Vernon furiously.
“What do they DO?”
“I told you — they suck all the happiness out of you,” said Harry,
“and if they get the chance, they kiss you —”
“Kiss you?” said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly. “Kiss you?”
“It’s what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.”
Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream.
“His soul? They didn’t take — he’s still got his —”
She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him.
“Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they had,” said
Harry, exasperated.
“Fought ’em off, did you, son?” said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the
appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a
plane he understood. “Gave ’em the old one-two, did you?”
“You can’t give a dementor the old one-two,” said Harry through
clenched teeth.
“Why’s he all right, then?” blustered Uncle Vernon. “Why isn’t he
all empty, then?”
“Because I used the Patronus —”
WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and a soft fall of
dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace.
35
a peck of owls
“FOR GOD’S SAKE!” roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps
of hair out of his mustache, something he hadn’t been driven to in
a long time. “I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT
TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!”
But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl’s
leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore,
explaining everything — the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything
out — that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius’s handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s ongoing rant about owls
and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius’s message.
Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that
had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over,
looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing there.
And now his temper was rising again. Wasn’t anybody going to say
“well done” for fighting off two dementors single-handedly? Both Mr.
Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he’d misbehaved and they
were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much
damage had been done.
“— a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house
and I won’t have it, boy, I won’t —”
“I can’t stop the owls coming,” Harry snapped, crushing Sirius’s letter in his fist.
“I want the truth about what happened tonight!” barked Uncle
Vernon. “If it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you’ve
been expelled? You did you-know-what, you’ve admitted it!”
Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to
36
chapter two
ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen,
away from the Dursleys.
“I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,” he said,
forcing himself to remain calm. “It’s the only thing that works against
them.”
“But what were dementoids doing in Little Whinging?” said Uncle
Vernon in tones of outrage.
“Couldn’t tell you,” said Harry wearily. “No idea.”
His head was pounding in the glare of the strip lighting now. His
anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were
all staring at him.
“It’s you,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “It’s got something to do
with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else
would they be down that alleyway? You’ve got to be the only — the
only —” Evidently he couldn’t bring himself to say the word “wizard.”
“The only you-know-what for miles.”
“I don’t know why they were here. . . .”
But at these words of Uncle Vernon’s, Harry’s exhausted brain
ground back into action. Why had the dementors come to Little
Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the
alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of
Magic lost control of the dementors, had they deserted Azkaban and
joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would?
“These demembers guard some weirdos’ prison?” said Uncle Vernon, lumbering in the wake of Harry’s train of thought.
“Yes,” said Harry.
If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the
kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think. . . .
“Oho! They were coming to arrest you!” said Uncle Vernon, with
the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion.
“That’s it, isn’t it, boy? You’re on the run from the law!”
37
a peck of owls
“Of course I’m not,” said Harry, shaking his head as though to
scare off a fly, his mind racing now.
“Then why — ?”
“He must have sent them,” said Harry quietly, more to himself
than to Uncle Vernon.
“What’s that? Who must have sent them?”
“Lord Voldemort,” said Harry.
He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who
flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like “wizard,”
“magic,” or “wand,” could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all
time without the slightest tremor.
“Lord — hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look
of dawning comprehension in his piggy eyes. “I’ve heard that name
. . . that was the one who . . .”
“Murdered my parents, yes,” Harry said.
“But he’s gone,” said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry’s parents might be a painful topic to
anybody. “That giant bloke said so. He’s gone.”
“He’s back,” said Harry heavily.
It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia’s surgically
clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen
television, and talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon.
The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have
caused a breach in the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly
non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry’s two
lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside down: The Dursleys were asking for details about the magical
world and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soaring around Little Whinging and he might never go back to Hogwarts.
Harry’s head throbbed more painfully.
“Back?” whispered Aunt Petunia.
38
chapter two
She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before.
And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother’s sister. He could not have
said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew
was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling
of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had
never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so
unlike her sister’s) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: They were
wide and fearful. The furious pretense that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry’s life — that there was no magic and no world other
than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon — seemed to have
fallen away.
“Yes,” Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. “He came
back a month ago. I saw him.”
Her hands found Dudley’s massive leather-clad shoulders and
clutched them.
“Hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and
back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. “Hang on.
This Lord Voldything’s back, you say.”
“Yes.”
“The one who murdered your parents.”
“Yes.”
“And now he’s sending dismembers after you?”
“Looks like it,” said Harry.
“I see,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to
Harry and hitching up his trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his
great purple face stretching before Harry’s eyes. “Well, that settles it,”
he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, “you can get out
of this house, boy!”
“What?” said Harry.
“You heard me — OUT!” Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt
39
a peck of owls
Petunia and Dudley jumped. “OUT! OUT! I should’ve done it years
ago! Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings exploding, half
the lounge destroyed, Dudley’s tail, Marge bobbing around on the
ceiling, and that flying Ford Anglia — OUT! OUT! You’ve had it!
You’re history! You’re not staying here if some loony’s after you, you’re
not endangering my wife and son, you’re not bringing trouble down
on us, if you’re going the same way as your useless parents, I’ve had it!
OUT!”
Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry,
Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his left hand. Don’t leave the
house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND
UNCLE’S HOUSE.
“You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon, bending forward now, so that
his massive purple face came closer to Harry’s, so that Harry actually
felt flecks of spit hit his face. “Get going! You were all keen to leave
half an hour ago! I’m right behind you! Get out and never darken our
doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in the first place I don’t know.
Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage, we were too
damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you,
thought we could turn you normal, but you’ve been rotten from the
beginning, and I’ve had enough — OWLS!”
The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the
floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech. Harry
raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but
it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let
out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the
red envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight up the chimney
again.
Harry darted forward to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat
him to it.
“You can open it if you like,” said Harry, “but I’ll hear what it says
anyway. That’s a Howler.”
40
chapter two
“Let go of it, Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “Don’t touch it, it
could be dangerous!”
“It’s addressed to me,” said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. “It’s
addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen,
Number Four, Privet Drive —”
She caught her breath, horrified. The red envelope had begun to
smoke.
“Open it!” Harry urged her. “Get it over with! It’ll happen
anyway —”
“No —”
Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the
kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late — the envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.
An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space,
issuing from the burning letter on the table.
“Remember my last, Petunia.”
Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the
chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands. The remains of the envelope smoldered into ash in the silence.
“What is this?” Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. “What — I don’t —
Petunia?”
Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his
mother, his mouth hanging open. The silence spiraled horribly. Harry
was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to
burst.
“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly. “P-Petunia?”
She raised her head. She was still trembling. She swallowed.
“The boy — the boy will have to stay, Vernon,” she said weakly.
“W-what?”
41
a peck of owls
“He stays,” she said. She was not looking at Harry. She got to her
feet again.
“He . . . but Petunia . . .”
“If we throw him out, the neighbors will talk,” she said. She was regaining her usual brisk, snappish manner rapidly, though she was still
very pale. “They’ll ask awkward questions, they’ll want to know where
he’s gone. We’ll have to keep him.”
Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire.
“But Petunia, dear —”
Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry.
“You’re to stay in your room,” she said. “You’re not to leave the
house. Now get to bed.”
Harry didn’t move.
“Who was that Howler from?”
“Don’t ask questions,” Aunt Petunia snapped.
“Are you in touch with wizards?”
“I told you to get to bed!”
“What did it mean? Remember the last what?”
“Go to bed!”
“How come — ?”
“YOU HEARD YOUR AUNT, NOW GET TO BED!”
42
chapter three
I’ve just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from
Hogwarts. I want to know what’s going on and when I’m going to get
out of here.
Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment
the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed
the first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His
owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk.
Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head
pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and
itched with tiredness. His back ached from carrying Dudley home,
and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit
him were throbbing painfully.
Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration,
grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at
the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him
in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic — and still no one was telling him what was going on.
the advance guard
43

And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had
echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen?
Why was he still trapped here without information? Why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid? Don’t do any more magic,
stay in the house. . . .
He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his
anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with
in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.
Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with
a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost.
“About time!” Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her
cage. “You can put that down, I’ve got work for you!”
Hedwig’s large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over
the dead frog clamped in her beak.
“Come here,” said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. “Take
these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Hermione and don’t come back here
without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they’ve written
decent-length answers if you’ve got to. Understand?”
Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of frog.
“Get going, then,” said Harry.
She took off immediately. The moment she’d gone, Harry threw
himself down onto his bed without undressing and stared at the dark
ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty
that he’d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at
number four, Privet Drive. But he’d make it up to her when she came
back with Sirius’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s answers.
They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t possibly ignore a dementor attack. He’d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat
letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the
Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling
all further thought.
44
chapter three
But Hedwig didn’t return next morning. Harry spent the day in his
bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day
Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap Uncle
Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her
approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might
as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got.
Otherwise the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn’t
see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would
achieve nothing except perhaps making him so angry he’d perform
more illegal magic.
So it went on for three whole days. Harry was filled alternately with
restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during
which he paced his bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them
for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete
that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into
space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.
What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his
wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go?
He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now
that he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged.
. . . Was it possible that he might be able to move into Sirius’s house,
as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee
from the Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there alone,
given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he
went next be decided for him; had his breach of the International
Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his
bed and began pacing again.
On the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure Harry was lying in
one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind
45
the advance guard
quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly
around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness.
“We’re going out,” he said.
“Sorry?”
“We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are going out.”
“Fine,” said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.
“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.”
“Okay.”
“You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our
possessions.”
“Right.”
“You are not to steal food from the fridge.”
“Okay.”
“I am going to lock your door.”
“You do that.”
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind
him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon’s footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the
slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable
sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.
Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made
no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could
not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light.
The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the
night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting
for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.
The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry
lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in
misery.
And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.
46
chapter three
He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn’t be
back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn’t heard their car.
There was silence for a few seconds, and then he heard voices.
Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet — but a split
second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices
down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly
not troubling to do so.
He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he
jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.
Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark
upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came.
He hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of
his room to the head of the stairs.
His heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing
in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing
through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could
see, looking up at him.
“Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye out,” said a
low, growling voice.
Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice,
but he did not lower his wand.
“Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly.
“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’” growled the voice, “never
got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you
properly.”
Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it,
nor did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had
recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye
Moody’s company only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, but an
impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before
47
the advance guard
being unmasked. But before he could make a decision about what to
do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs.
“It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away.”
Harry’s heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he hadn’t heard
it for more than a year.
“P-Professor Lupin?” he said disbelievingly. “Is that you?”
“Why are we all standing in the dark?” said a third voice, this one
completely unfamiliar, a woman’s. “Lumos.”
A wand-tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry
blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs,
gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look.
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young, Lupin
looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when Harry
had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who
tried to smile back through his shock.
“Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,” said the witch who
was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had
a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair
that was a violent shade of violet. “Wotcher, Harry!”
“Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,” said a bald black wizard
standing farthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single
gold hoop in his ear. “He looks exactly like James.”
“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the
back. “Lily’s eyes.”
Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large chunk
missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through
his mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and beady, the
other large, round, and electric blue — the magical eye that could see
through walls, doors, and the back of Moody’s own head.
“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d be a nice
48
chapter three
lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We
ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know. Unless
anyone brought any Veritaserum?”
“Harry, what form does your Patronus take?” said Lupin.
“A stag,” said Harry nervously.
“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin.
Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring
at him, stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came.
“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. “What if it ignited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!”
“Who d’you know who’s lost a buttock?” the violet-haired woman
asked Mad-Eye interestedly.
“Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back pocket!”
growled Mad-Eye. “Elementary wand safety, nobody bothers about it
anymore. . . .” He stumped off toward the kitchen. “And I saw that,”
he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the ceiling.
Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry’s.
“How are you?” he asked, looking at Harry closely.
“F-fine . . .”
Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive,
and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly
in the house as though this were a long-standing arrangement. He
glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly
at him. He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his
hair for four days.
“I’m — you’re really lucky the Dursleys are out . . .” he mumbled.
“Lucky, ha!” said the violet-haired woman. “It was me that lured
them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they’d
been short-listed for the All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn
Competition. They’re heading off to the prize-giving right now. . . .
Or they think they are.”
49
the advance guard
Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon’s face when he realized
there was no All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.
“We are leaving, aren’t we?” he asked. “Soon?”
“Almost at once,” said Lupin, “we’re just waiting for the all-clear.”
“Where are we going? The Burrow?” Harry asked hopefully.
“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning Harry toward the
kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously. “Too risky. We’ve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable.
It’s taken a while. . . .”
Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging
from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in
the Dursleys’ many labor-saving appliances.
“This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” Lupin continued, pointing toward
Moody.
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd to be introduced to somebody he’d thought he’d known for a year.
“And this is Nymphadora —”
“Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young witch with a
shudder. “It’s Tonks.”
“— Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname
only,” finished Lupin.
“So would you if your fool of a mother had called you ‘Nymphadora,’” muttered Tonks.
“And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt” — he indicated the tall black
wizard, who bowed — “Elphias Doge” — the wheezy-voiced wizard
nodded — “Dedalus Diggle —”
“We’ve met before,” squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his
top hat.
“— Emmeline Vance” — a stately looking witch in an emeraldgreen shawl inclined her head — “Sturgis Podmore” — a square-jawed
wizard with thick, straw-colored hair winked — “and Hestia Jones.” A
pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster.
50
chapter three
Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were
introduced. He wished they would look at something other than him;
it was as though he had suddenly been ushered onstage. He also wondered why so many of them were there.
“A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,”
said Lupin, as though he had read Harry’s mind; the corners of his
mouth twitched slightly.
“Yeah, well, the more the better,” said Moody darkly. “We’re your
guard, Potter.”
“We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to set off,” said
Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. “We’ve got about fifteen
minutes.”
“Very clean, aren’t they, these Muggles?” said the witch called
Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. “My
dad’s Muggle-born and he’s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just
like with wizards?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry. “Look” — he turned back to Lupin —
“what’s going on, I haven’t heard anything from anyone, what’s Vol — ?”
Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, “Shut up!”
“What?” said Harry.
“We’re not discussing anything here, it’s too risky,” said Moody,
turning his normal eye on Harry; his magical eye remained pointing
up at the ceiling. “Damn it,” he added angrily, putting a hand up to the
magical eye, “it keeps sticking — ever since that scum wore it —”
And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being
pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye.
“Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?” said Tonks
conversationally.
“Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” asked Moody.
Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass, and filled it
51
the advance guard
with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards.
Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him.
“Cheers,” said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He
dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and
down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. “I want
three-hundred-and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.”
“How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry asked.
“Brooms,” said Lupin. “Only way. You’re too young to Apparate,
they’ll be watching the Floo Network, and it’s more than our life’s
worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey.”
“Remus says you’re a good flier,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his
deep voice.
“He’s excellent,” said Lupin, who was checking his watch. “Anyway, you’d better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go
when the signal comes.”
“I’ll come and help you,” said Tonks brightly.
She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking
around with much curiosity and interest.
“Funny place,” she said, “it’s a bit too clean, d’you know what I
mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,” she added, as they entered
Harry’s bedroom and he turned on the light.
His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house.
Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn
over the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each in turn and
thrown it aside. Hedwig’s cage needed cleaning out and was starting to
smell, and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle
clothes and wizard’s robes that had spilled onto the floor around it.
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his
trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door.
52
chapter three
“You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color,” she said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. “D’you think it makes me look
a bit peaky?”
“Er —” said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch
Teams of Britain and Ireland.
“Yeah, it does,” said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a
strained expression as though she were struggling to remember something. A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.
“How did you do that?” said Harry, gaping at her as she opened
her eyes again.
“I’m a Metamorphmagus,” she said, looking back at her reflection
and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions.
“It means I can change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting
Harry’s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. “I was born one.
I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training
without any study at all, it was great.”
“You’re an Auror?” said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark wizard
catcher was the only career he’d ever considered after Hogwarts.
“Yeah,” said Tonks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as well; he’s a bit
higher up than I am, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed
on Stealth and Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that
plate when we arrived downstairs?”
“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry asked her,
straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.
Tonks chuckled.
“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?”
Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s forehead.
“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not
like people staring at his scar.
“Well, you’ll have to learn the hard way, I’m afraid,” said Tonks.
“Metamorphmagi are really rare, they’re born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance. . . .
53
the advance guard
But we’ve got to get going, Harry, we’re supposed to be packing,” she
added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor.
“Oh — yeah,” said Harry, grabbing up a few more books.
“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack!” cried Tonks,
waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.
Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew
pell-mell into the trunk.
“It’s not very neat,” said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and
looking down at the jumble inside. “My mum’s got this knack of
getting stuff to fit itself in neatly — she even gets the socks to fold
themselves — but I’ve never mastered how she does it — it’s a kind
of flick —”
She flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry’s socks gave a feeble
sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess within.
“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, “at least it’s
all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too — Scourgify —” She
pointed her wand at Hedwig’s cage; a few feathers and droppings vanished. “Well, that’s a bit better — I’ve never quite got the hang of
these sort of householdy spells. Right — got everything? Cauldron?
Broom? Wow! A Firebolt?”
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry’s right
hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international standard broomstick.
“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks enviously.
“Ah well . . . wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay,
let’s go. Locomotor Trunk.”
Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like
a conductor’s baton, Tonks made it hover across the room and out of
the door ahead of them, Hedwig’s cage in her left hand. Harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick.
Back in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye, which was
spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick. Kingsley

chapter three
Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and
Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while
rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the
Dursleys.
“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered.
“We’ve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into
the garden so we’re ready. Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and
uncle not to worry —”
“They won’t,” said Harry.
“That you’re safe —”
“That’ll just depress them.”
“— and you’ll see them next summer.”
“Do I have to?”
Lupin smiled but made no answer.
“Come here, boy,” said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry toward
him with his wand. “I need to Disillusion you.”
“You need to what?” said Harry nervously.
“Disillusionment Charm,” said Moody, raising his wand. “Lupin
says you’ve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won’t stay on while we’re
flying; this’ll disguise you better. Here you go —”
He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold
trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand
had struck.
“Nice one, Mad-Eye,” said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry’s
midriff.
Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body,
for it didn’t look anything like his anymore. It was not invisible; it had
simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind
him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon.
“Come on,” said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.
They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon’s beautifully kept lawn.

the advance guard
“Clear night,” grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens. “Could’ve done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,” he
barked at Harry, “we’re going to be flying in close formation. Tonks’ll
be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin’ll be covering
you from below. I’m going to be behind you. The rest’ll be circling us.
We don’t break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed —”
“Is that likely?” Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored
him.
“— the others keep flying, don’t stop, don’t break ranks. If they
take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing
by to take over; keep flying east and they’ll join you.”
“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not taking this
seriously,” said Tonks, as she strapped Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s
cage into a harness hanging from her broom.
“I’m just telling the boy the plan,” growled Moody. “Our job’s to
deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt —”
“No one’s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep,
calming voice.
“Mount your brooms, that’s the first signal!” said Lupin sharply,
pointing into the sky.
Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among
the stars. Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks. He swung
his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it
vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in
the air once more.
“Second signal, let’s go!” said Lupin loudly, as more sparks, green
this time, exploded high above them.
Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed
through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away,
shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and
every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as
though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though
56
chapter three
his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about all summer,
he was going home. . . . For a few glorious moments, all his problems
seemed to recede into nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.
“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Muggle looking up!” shouted Moody
from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching
his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. “We need more height.
. . . Give it another quarter of a mile!”
Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see
nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights
and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon’s car. . . . The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty
house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition
. . . and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was
drowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their
ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month,
or this happy. . . .
“Bearing south!” shouted Mad-Eye. “Town ahead!”
They soared right, so that they did not pass directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below.
“Bear southeast and keep climbing, there’s some low cloud ahead
we can lose ourselves in!” called Moody.
“We’re not going through clouds!” shouted Tonks angrily. “We’ll
get soaked, Mad-Eye!”
Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing
numb on the Firebolt’s handle. He wished he had thought to put on a
coat; he was starting to shiver.
They altered their course every now and then according to MadEye’s instructions. Harry’s eyes were screwed up against the rush of
icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache. He could remember
being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch
57
the advance guard
match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in
a storm. The guard around him was circling continuously like giant
birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they
had been flying; it felt like an hour at least.
“Turning southwest!” yelled Moody. “We want to avoid the
motorway!”
Harry was now so chilled that he thought longingly for a moment
of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even
more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames.
. . . Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring
gleaming slightly in the moonlight. . . . Now Emmeline Vance was on
his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right . . . then she
too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore. . . .
“We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we’re not being followed!” Moody shouted.
“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks screamed from the front.
“We’re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off course we’re not
going to get there until next week! We’re nearly there now!”
“Time to start the descent!” came Lupin’s voice. “Follow Tonks,
Harry!”
Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the
largest collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling, crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches
of deepest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials.
He wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure that
someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom.
“Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed.
Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch
of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already
unbuckling Harry’s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy
58
chapter three
fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them
had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish
lay outside several sets of front steps.
“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, “In a minute.”
Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy
with cold.
“Got it,” he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette
lighter into the air and clicking it.
The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the unlighter again; the next lamp went out. He kept clicking until every
lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square
came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.
“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, pocketing the
Put-Outer. “That’ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now, come on, quick.”
He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass,
across the road, and onto the pavement. Lupin and Tonks followed,
carrying Harry’s trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with
their wands out, flanking them.
The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came
from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate.
“Here,” Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward
Harry’s Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as
to illuminate the writing. “Read quickly and memorize.”
Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting
was vaguely familiar. It said:
The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at
number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.
59
chapter four
What’s the Order of the — ?” Harry began.
“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody. “Wait till we’re inside!”
He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry’s hand and set fire
to it with his wand-tip. As the message curled into flames and floated
to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again. They were
standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number
ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen.
“But where’s — ?”
“Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin quietly.
Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of
nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by
dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had
inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at
it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles
inside hadn’t even felt anything.
“Come on, hurry,” growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.
number twelve,
grimmauld place

chapter four
Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materialized door. Its black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver door
knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole
or letterbox.
Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard
many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a
chain. The door creaked open.
“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered. “But don’t go far inside
and don’t touch anything.”
Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of
the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the
place had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his shoulder
and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying his
trunk and Hedwig’s cage. Moody was standing on the top step and
releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the streetlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square beyond glowed
momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed
the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete.
“Here —”
He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt
as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and
knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
“Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,”
Moody whispered.
The others’ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying
person. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas
lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a
long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry
61
n um b e r t w e l v e ,
grimmauld place
heard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier
and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.
There were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. Weasley,
emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in
welcome as she hurried toward them, though Harry noticed that she
was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen
her.
“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, pulling him into
a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm’s length and examining
him critically. “You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll
have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid. . . .”
She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently, “He’s just arrived, the meeting’s started. . . .”
The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past Harry toward the door through which
Mrs. Weasley had just come; Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs.
Weasley held him back.
“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the Order. Ron and
Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting’s
over and then we’ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the
hall,” she added in an urgent whisper.
“Why?”
“I don’t want to wake anything up.”
“What d’you — ?”
“I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the meeting — I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping.”
Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes past a pair of
long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must
be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked
as though it had been made from a severed troll’s leg, they started up
the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on
62
chapter four
plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged
to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snoutlike nose.
Harry’s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on
earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to
the Darkest of wizards?
“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?”
“Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got
to dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. “There” — they had
reached the second landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call
you when it’s over.”
And she hurried off downstairs again.
Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob,
which was shaped like a serpent’s head, and opened the door.
He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded
room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even
louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair — Hermione had thrown herself onto him in a
hug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon,
zoomed excitedly round and round their heads.
“HARRY! Ron, he’s here, Harry’s here! We didn’t hear you arrive!
Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us?
I bet you have, I know our letters were useless — but we couldn’t tell
you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn’t, oh, we’ve got
so much to tell you, and you’ve got to tell us — the dementors! When
we heard — and that Ministry hearing — it’s just outrageous, I’ve
looked it all up, they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s provision
in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of
magic in life-threatening situations —”
“Let him breathe, Hermione,” said Ron, grinning, closing the door
behind Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during
their month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than
ever, though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same.
63
n um b e r t w e l v e ,
grimmauld place
Hermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before she could say
another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white
soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry’s
shoulder.
“Hedwig!”
The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately
as Harry stroked her feathers.
“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “Pecked us half to death
when she brought your last letters, look at this —”
He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported
a half-healed but clearly deep cut.
“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers,
you know. . . .”
“We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron. “Hermione was
going spare, she kept saying you’d do something stupid if you were
stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us —”
“— swear not to tell me,” said Harry. “Yeah, Hermione’s already
said.”
The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two
best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his
stomach. All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid
month — he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone.
There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the others.
“He seemed to think it was best,” said Hermione rather breathlessly. “Dumbledore, I mean.”
“Right,” said Harry. He noticed that her hands too bore the marks
of Hedwig’s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.
“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles —” Ron
began.
“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Have either of you been
attacked by dementors this summer?”
64
chapter four
“Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the Order of the
Phoenix tailing you all the time —”
Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a
step going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed
except him.
“Didn’t work that well, though, did it?” said Harry, doing his
utmost to keep his voice even. “Had to look after myself after all,
didn’t I?”
“He was so angry,” said Hermione in an almost awestruck voice.
“Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left
before his shift had ended. He was scary.”
“Well, I’m glad he left,” Harry said coldly. “If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t
have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at
Privet Drive all summer.”
“Aren’t you . . . aren’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic
hearing?” said Hermione quietly.
“No,” Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking
around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this
room was not likely to raise his spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank
stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the
bareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he
heard someone lurking out of sight snigger.
“So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?”
Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. “Did you —
er — bother to ask him at all?”
He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told
him he was behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing
to improve his temper.
“We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,”
said Ron. “We did, mate. But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen
him twice since we came here and he didn’t have much time, he just
65
n um b e r t w e l v e ,
grimmauld place
made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said
the owls might be intercepted —”
“He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to,” Harry said
shortly. “You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages
without owls.”
Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, “I thought that too. But
he didn’t want you to know anything.”
“Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted,” said Harry, watching their
expressions.
“Don’t be thick,” said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.
“Or that I can’t take care of myself —”
“Of course he doesn’t think that!” said Hermione anxiously.
“So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while you two get to
join in everything that’s going on here?” said Harry, the words tumbling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every
word. “How come you two are allowed to know everything that’s going on — ?”
“We’re not!” Ron interrupted. “Mum won’t let us near the meetings, she says we’re too young —”
But before he knew it, Harry was shouting.
“SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL!
YOU’VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN’T YOU? YOU’VE STILL
BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I’VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND I’VE HANDLED MORE THAN
YOU TWO’VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE
KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE?
WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR
SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?”
Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past
month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the
hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being
66
chapter four
followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed
of finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and
soared off on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in
alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads.
“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES
AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW
HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!”
Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned
and at a loss for anything to say, while Hermione looked on the verge
of tears.
“BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? WHY
SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT’S BEEN
HAPPENING?”
“Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did —” Hermione began.
“CAN’T’VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR
YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE
MADE YOU SWEAR —”
“Well, he did —”
“FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE,
NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT
WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON —”
“We wanted to —”
“I SUPPOSE YOU’VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH,
HAVEN’T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER —”
“No, honest —”
“Harry, we’re really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, her eyes now
sparkling with tears. “You’re absolutely right, Harry — I’d be furious
if it was me!”
Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from
them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the
top of the wardrobe. There was a long pause, broken only by the
mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry’s feet.
67
n um b e r t w e l v e ,
grimmauld place
“What is this place anyway?” he shot at Ron and Hermione.
“Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron at once.
“Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the
Phoenix — ?”
“It’s a secret society,” said Hermione quickly. “Dumbledore’s in
charge, he founded it. It’s the people who fought against You-KnowWho last time.”
“Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his
pockets.
“Quite a few people —”
“— we’ve met about twenty of them,” said Ron, “but we think
there are more. . . .”
Harry glared at them.
“Well?” he demanded, looking from one to the other.
“Er,” said Ron. “Well what?”
“Voldemort!” said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione
winced. “What’s happening? What’s he up to? Where is he? What are
we doing to stop him?”
“We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their meetings,” said
Hermione nervously. “So we don’t know the details — but we’ve got a
general idea —” she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry’s face.
“Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,” said Ron.
“They’re really useful.”
“Extendable — ?”
“Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately because
Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them
all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of
them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the
Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you
know —”
“— some of them are working on recruiting more people to the
Order —” said Hermione.
68
chapter four
“— and some of them are standing guard over something,” said
Ron. “They’re always talking about guard duty.”
“Couldn’t have been me, could it?” said Harry sarcastically.
“Oh yeah,” said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.
Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at Ron and Hermione. “So what have you two been doing,
if you’re not allowed in meetings?” he demanded. “You said you’d
been busy.”
“We have,” said Hermione quickly. “We’ve been decontaminating
this house, it’s been empty for ages and stuff’s been breeding in here.
We’ve managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I
think we’re doing the drawing room tomo — AARGH!”
With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron’s elder twin brothers,
had materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig
on top of the wardrobe.
“Stop doing that!” Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as
vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter.
“Hello, Harry,” said George, beaming at him. “We thought we
heard your dulcet tones.”
“You don’t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all
out,” said Fred, also beaming. “There might be a couple of people fifty
miles away who didn’t hear you.”
“You two passed your Apparation tests, then?” asked Harry
grumpily.
“With distinction,” said Fred, who was holding what looked like a
piece of very long, flesh-colored string.
“It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down
the stairs,” said Ron.
“Time is Galleons, little brother,” said Fred. “Anyway, Harry, you’re
interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,” he added in response to
69
n um b e r t w e l v e ,
grimmauld place
Harry’s raised eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now saw
was trailing out onto the landing. “We’re trying to hear what’s going
on downstairs.”
“You want to be careful,” said Ron, staring at the ear. “If Mum sees
one of them again . . .”
“It’s worth the risk, that’s a major meeting they’re having,” said
Fred.
The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.
“Oh hello, Harry!” said Ron’s younger sister, Ginny, brightly. “I
thought I heard your voice.”
Turning to Fred and George she said, “It’s no go with the Extendable Ears, she’s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen
door.”
“How d’you know?” said George, looking crestfallen.
“Tonks told me how to find out,” said Ginny. “You just chuck stuff
at the door and if it can’t make contact the door’s been Imperturbed.
I’ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they
just soar away from it, so there’s no way the Extendable Ears will be
able to get under the gap.”
Fred heaved a deep sigh. “Shame. I really fancied finding out what
old Snape’s been up to.”
“Snape?” said Harry quickly. “Is he here?”
“Yeah,” said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down
on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. “Giving a report. Top
secret.”
“Git,” said Fred idly.
“He’s on our side now,” said Hermione reprovingly.
Ron snorted. “Doesn’t stop him being a git. The way he looks at us
when he sees us. . . .”
“Bill doesn’t like him either,” said Ginny, as though that settled the
matter.
70
chapter four
Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for
information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank
onto the bed opposite the others.
“Is Bill here?” he asked. “I thought he was working in Egypt.”
“He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for
the Order,” said Fred. “He says he misses the tombs, but,” he smirked,
“there are compensations. . . .”
“What d’you mean?”
“Remember old Fleur Delacour?” said George. “She’s got a job at
Gringotts to eemprove ’er Eeenglish —”
“— and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons,” sniggered
Fred.
“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s still in Romania,
Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so
Charlie’s trying to make contacts on his days off.”
“Couldn’t Percy do that?” Harry asked. The last he had heard, the
third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic.
At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly
significant looks.
“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,”
Ron told Harry in a tense voice.
“Why not?”
“Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” Fred said.
“It’s been awful,” said Ginny sadly.
“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face.
“What’s happened?” Harry said.
“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen Dad row
with anyone like that. It’s normally Mum who shouts. . . .”
“It was the first week back after term ended,” said Ron. “We were

n um b e r t w e l v e ,
grimmauld place
about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he’d
been promoted.”
“You’re kidding?” said Harry.
Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious,
Harry’s impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his
first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large
oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by
Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed that — they all
thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad).
“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because Percy got into
a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything.
They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and
informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge,
he wasn’t going to complain. . . .”
“So how come they promoted him?”
“That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who seemed very
keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped
yelling. “He came home really pleased with himself — even more
pleased than usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d been
offered a position in Fudge’s own office. A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts — Junior Assistant to the Minister.
He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.”
“Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly.
“Why not?” said Harry.
“Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry
checking that nobody’s having any contact with Dumbledore,” said
George.
“Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the Ministry these days, see,”
said Fred. “They all think he’s just making trouble saying You-KnowWho’s back.”
“Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who’s in league with
Dumbledore can clear out their desks,” said George.
72
chapter four
“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s friendly with Dumbledore, and he’s always thought Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his
Muggle obsession —”
“But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked Harry, confused.
“I’m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in
his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family — and
Dumbledore.”
Harry let out a low whistle.
“Bet Percy loved that.”
Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way.
“He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said loads of terrible stuff. He said he’s been having to struggle against Dad’s lousy
reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no
ambition and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not had a
lot of money, I mean —”
“What?” said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an
angry cat.
“I know,” said Ron in a low voice. “And it got worse. He said Dad
was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was
heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and
that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the
Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the
Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn’t belong
to our family anymore. And he packed his bags the same night and
left. He’s living here in London now.”
Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of
Ron’s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things
to Mr. Weasley.
“Mum’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “You know — crying and
stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed
the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work —
ignores him, I s’pose.”
73
n um b e r t w e l v e ,
grimmauld place
“But Percy must know Voldemort’s back,” said Harry slowly. “He’s
not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof —”
“Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. “Percy said the only evidence was your word
and . . . I dunno . . . he didn’t think it was good enough.”
“Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,” said Hermione tartly, and
the others all nodded.
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, looking around at
them all. They were all regarding him warily.
“Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the Daily Prophet?” Hermione asked nervously.
“Yeah, I have!” said Harry.
“Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly?” Hermione asked
still more anxiously.
“Not cover to cover,” said Harry defensively. “If they were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news,
wouldn’t it!”
The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried on, “Well, you’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but
they — um — they mention you a couple of times a week.”
“But I’d have seen —”
“Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn’t,” said
Hermione, shaking her head. “I’m not talking about big articles. They
just slip you in, like you’re a standing joke.”
“What d’you — ?”
“It’s quite nasty, actually,” said Hermione in a voice of forced calm.
“They’re just building on Rita’s stuff.”
“But she’s not writing for them anymore, is she?”
“Oh no, she’s kept her promise — not that she’s got any choice,”
Hermione added with satisfaction. “But she laid the foundation for
what they’re trying to do now.”
74
chapter four
“Which is what?” said Harry impatiently.
“Okay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the
place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter’s stories about him in a hurry.
“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this deluded,
attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a great tragic hero or something,” said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly. “They keep slipping in snide
comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears they say something like ‘a tale worthy of Harry Potter’ and if anyone has a funny
accident or anything it’s ‘let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his forehead
or we’ll be asked to worship him next —’”
“I don’t want anyone to worship —” Harry began hotly.
“I know you don’t,” said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. “I
know, Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn you
into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything. They want wizards on the street to think you’re just some stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because
he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.”
“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — Voldemort killed my parents!”
Harry spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but
couldn’t kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they think
I’d rather it’d never —”
“We know, Harry,” said Ginny earnestly.
“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors
attacking you,” said Hermione. “Someone’s told them to keep that
quiet. That should’ve been a really big story, out-of-control dementors. They haven’t even reported that you broke the International
Statute of Secrecy — we thought they would, it would tie in so well
with this image of you as some stupid show-off— we think they’re
75
n um b e r t w e l v e ,
grimmauld place
biding their time until you’re expelled, then they’re really going to go
to town — I mean, if you’re expelled, obviously,” she went on hastily,
“you really shouldn’t be, not if they abide by their own laws, there’s
no case against you.”
They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think
about it. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved
the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the
stairs.
“Uh-oh.”
Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud
crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway.
“The meeting’s over, you can come down and have dinner now,
everyone’s dying to see you, Harry. And who’s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?”
“Crookshanks,” said Ginny unblushingly. “He loves playing with
them.”
“Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I thought it might have been Kreacher,
he keeps doing odd things like that. Now don’t forget to keep your
voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you
been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please. . . .”
Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the
room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione again. Both of
them were watching him apprehensively, as though they feared that he
would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight
of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed.
“Look . . .” he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione
said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, Harry, we really don’t blame
you, but you’ve got to understand, we did try and persuade Dumbledore —”
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry grudgingly.
76
chapter four
He cast around for a topic to change the subject from Dumbledore — the very thought of him made Harry’s insides burn with
anger again.
“Who’s Kreacher?” he asked.
“The house-elf who lives here,” said Ron. “Nutter. Never met one
like him.”
Hermione frowned at Ron.
“He’s not a nutter, Ron —”
“His life’s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a
plaque just like his mother,” said Ron irritably. “Is that normal, Hermione?”
“Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault —”
Ron rolled his eyes at Harry.
“Hermione still hasn’t given up on spew —”
“It’s not ‘spew’!” said Hermione heatedly. “It’s the Society for the
Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s not just me, Dumbledore says we
should be kind to Kreacher too —”
“Yeah, yeah,” said Ron. “C’mon, I’m starving.”
He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before
they could descend the stairs — “Hold it!” Ron breathed, flinging out
an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any farther. “They’re
still in the hall, we might be able to hear something —”
The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy
hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of
Harry’s guard. They were whispering excitedly together. In the very
center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape.
Harry leaned farther over the banisters. He was very interested in what
Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix. . . .
A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front of Harry’s
eyes. Looking up he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cautiously lowering the Extendable Ear toward the dark knot of people
77
n um b e r t w e l v e ,
grimmauld place
below. A moment later, however, they began to move toward the front
door and out of sight.
“Dammit,” Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable
Ear back up again.
They heard the front door open and then close.
“Snape never eats here,” Ron told Harry quietly. “Thank God.
C’mon.”
“And don’t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,” Hermione whispered.
As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall they saw Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its
many locks and bolts behind those who had just left.
“We’re eating down in the kitchen,” Mrs. Weasley whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. “Harry, dear, if you’ll just tiptoe
across the hall, it’s through this door here —”
CRASH.
“Tonks!” cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to look behind
her.
“I’m sorry!” wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. “It’s that
stupid umbrella stand, that’s the second time I’ve tripped over —”
But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, earsplitting,
bloodcurdling screech.
The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown
apart, but there was no door behind them. For a split second, Harry
thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which
an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though
she was being tortured — then he realized it was simply a life-size
portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever
seen in his life.
The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing
skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed, and all along the hall
behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that
78
chapter four
Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands
over his ears.
Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she
screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces.
“Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants,
freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my
fathers —”
Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same time dragging
the huge, heavy troll’s leg back off the floor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned
the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall,
Stunning all the other portraits with her wand. Then a man with long
black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry.
“Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!” he roared, seizing the
curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned.
The old woman’s face blanched.
“Yoooou!” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man.
“Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!”
“I said — shut — UP!” roared the man, and with a stupendous effort he and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again.
The old woman’s screeches died and an echoing silence fell.
Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes,
Harry’s godfather, Sirius, turned to face him.
“Hello, Harry,” he said grimly, “I see you’ve met my mother.”

Chapter 1
The Dark Lord
Ascending
T
he two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart
in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood
quite still, wands directed at each other’s chests; then,
recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.
“News?” asked the taller of the two.
“The best,” replied Severus Snape.
The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, nearty manicured hedge. The men’s
long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.
“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging tress broke
the moonlight. “It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope
he will be satisfied. You should confident that your reception will
1
Chapter 1
be good?”
Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into
a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with
them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive
wrought-iron gates barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke
step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and
passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke.
The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s footsteps. There
was a rustle somewhere to their right; Yaxley drew his wand again,
pointing it over his companion’s head, but the source of the noise
proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting
majestically along the top of the hedge.
“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks . . . ” Yaxley
thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort.
A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end
of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a
fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape
and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at
their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.
The hallway was large, dimly light, and sumptuously decorated,
with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes
of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley
as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door
leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat,
then Snape turned the bronze handle.
The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and
ornate table. The room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire
2
The Dark Lord Ascending
beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded
mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were
drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene; an apparently
unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected
in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below.
He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every
minute or so.
“Yaxley, Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the
table. “You are very nearly late.”
The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that
it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more
than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, this face shone
through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and
gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that
he seemed to emit a pearly glow.
“Severus, here,” said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. “Yaxley—beside Dolohov.”
The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around
the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke
first.
“So?”
“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry
Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”
The interest around the table sharpened palpably; Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.
“Saturday . . . at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His red eyes
3
Chapter 1
fastened upon Snape’s black ones with such intensity that some of
the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves
would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however,
looked calmly back into Voldemort’s face and, after a moment or
two. Voldemort’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.
“Good. Very good. And this information comes— ”
“— from the source we discussed,” said Snape.
“My Lord.”
Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to him.
“My Lord, I have heard differently,”
Yaxley waited but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on,
“Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until
the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.”
Snape was smiling,
“My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail;
this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed
upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be
susceptible.”
“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said
Yaxley.
“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape.
“I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in
the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have
infiltrated the Ministry.”
“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man
sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that
was echoed here and there along the table.
Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to
4
The Dark Lord Ascending
the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in
thought.
“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party
of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy— ”
Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at
once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.
“Where are they going to hide the boy next?”
“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The place,
according to the source, has been given every protection that the
Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is
little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of
course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might
give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.”
“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the firelight
glinting strangely in his red eyes. “Will the Ministry have fallen
by next Saturday?”
Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.
“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have—with difficulty, and after great effort— succeeded in placing an Imperius
Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.” Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long,
twisted face, clapped him on the back.
“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only one
man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act.
One failed attempt on the Minister’s life will set me back a long
way.”
“Yes—my Lord, that is true—but you know, as Head of the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular
5
Chapter 1
contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads
of all the other Ministry departments. I will, I think, be easy now
that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to
subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring
Scrimgeour down.”
“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he
has converted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At any rate, it remains
unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we
cannot touch the boy at his destination, the it must be done while
he travels.”
“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who
seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. “We now
have several people planted within the Department of Magical
Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall
know immediately.”
“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The order is eschewing any
form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry;
they mistrust everything to do with the place.”
“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move in the
open. Easier to take, by far.”
Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he
went on, “I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too
many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them
have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors
than to his triumphs.”
The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they
might be blamed for Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any
6
The Dark Lord Ascending
of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.
“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and
chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know
better now. I understand those things that I did not understand
before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”
At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail
sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of
those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had
seemed to issue from below their feet.
“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet,
thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving
body above, “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner
quiet?”
“Yes, m–my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table,
who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at
first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and
scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious
gleam of silver.
“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again at the
tense faces of his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need,
for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill
Potter.”
The faces around his displayed nothing but shock; he might
have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.
“No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see . . . Lucius, I see
no reason for you to have a wand anymore.”
Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy
in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he
spoke, his voice was hoarse.
7
Chapter 1
“My Lord?”
“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.”
“I . . . ”
Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight
ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down
her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his
wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew
a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in from
of his red eyes, examining it closely.
“What is it?”
“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy.
“And the core?”
“Dragon—dragon heartstring.”
“Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement;
for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort’s want in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed
by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously.
“Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?”
Some of the throng sniggered.
“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for
you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than
happy of late . . . What is it about my presence in your home that
displeases you, Lucius?”
“Nothing—nothing, my Lord!”
“Such lies, Lucius . . . ”
The soft voice seems to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had
stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a
shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard
8
The Dark Lord Ascending
sliding across the floor beneath the table.
The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair.
It rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s
shoulders; its neck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with
their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the
creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius
Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my
return, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire
for so many years?”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as
he wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it—we do.”
To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes
averted from Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco,
who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly
at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact.
“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her
voice constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here,
in our family’s house. There can be no higher pleasure.”
She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark
hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor;
where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward
Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longer for
closeness.
“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a
little to one side as he considered Bellatrix. “That means a great
deal, Bellatrix, from you,”
Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight.
“My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!”
9
Chapter 1
“No higher pleasure . . . even compared with the happy event
that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?”
She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.
“I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.”
“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And your, Lucius and
Narcissa. She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You
must be so proud.”
There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table.
Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks, a few thumped the
table with their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance,
opened its mouth and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did
not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys’
humiliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently flushed with happiness,
had turned an ugly, blotchy red.
“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring
of mirth. “We—Narcissa and I—have never set eyes on our sister
since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with
either of us, nor any beast she marries.”
“What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice
was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will
you babysit the cubs?”
The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his
father, who was staring down into his own lap, then caught his
mother’s eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall.
“Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake.
“Enough.”
And the laughter died at once.
“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over
10
The Dark Lord Ascending
time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring.
“You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut
away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.”
“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with
tears of gratitude again. “At the first chance!”
“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so
in the world . . . we shall cut away the canker that infects us until
only those of the true blood remain . . . ”
Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it directly at
the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it
a tiny flick. The figure came to life with a groan and began to
struggle against invisible bonds.
“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort.
Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death
Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had
been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face
the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice. “Severus! Help me!”
“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.
“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout
with his wand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that
the woman had woken, he seems unable to look at her anymore.
“But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort.
“For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by
Charity Burbage, who until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A
broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.
“Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and
11
Chapter 1
wizards all about Muggles . . . how they are not so different from
us . . . ”
One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage
revolved to face Snape again.
“Severus . . . please . . . please . . . ”
“Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s
wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged. “Not content with
corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last
week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept
those thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling
of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable
circumstance . . . She would have use all mate with Muggles . . . or,
no doubt, werewolves . . . ”
Nobody laughed this time; There was no mistaking the anger
and contempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity
Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes
into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she
turned slowly away from his again.
“Avada Kedavra.”
The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room.
Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which
trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in
their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor.
“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great snake
swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood.

arry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left
and sweating under his breath, he shouldered open his
bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china.
He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been
sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door.
“What the—?”
He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive,
was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley’s idea of a clever
booby trap. Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped
the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them
into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door.
Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under
the tap.
It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still
had four days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had
to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have
defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and
now he came to think of it—particularly in light of his immediate
13
Chapter 2
plans—it seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. Making a
mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad
of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before
returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.
Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school
trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the
start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off
the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated
them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom— old quills,
desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a
stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn
it to see a lot of blood. He now proceeded a little more cautiously.
Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the
bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a
cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which
a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the
sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It
was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead
godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained
of his godfather’s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to
the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.
Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut
himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back
at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning’s
Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to
stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret
14
In Memoriam
and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned,
by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.
It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the
useless items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether
or not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch
robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were
piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and
uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books,
the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In
a front pocket were the Marauder’s Map and the locket with the
note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place
on honor not because it was valuable—in all usual senses it was
worthless—but because of what it had cost to attain it.
This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside
his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent
at Privet Drive this summer.
He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk.
Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers, throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one. The owl as
asleep, or else faking: she was angry with Harry about the limited
amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment.
As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed
down, searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived
shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about
the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at
15
Chapter 2
Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into
his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for.
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED
by Elphias Doge
I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our
first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was
undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox
shortly before arriving at school, and while I was
no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and
greenish hue did not encourage many to approach
me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts
under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a
year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon
three young Muggles.
Albus never attempted to deny that his father
(who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this
crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage
to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father
to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to
speak of the sad business, though many attempted
to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to
praise his father’s action and assumed that Albus
too was a Muggle-hater. They could not have been
more mistaken. As anybody who knew Albus would
attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle
tendency. Indeed, his determined support for Mug16
In Memoriam
gle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent
years.
In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own
fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By
the end of his first year he would never again be
known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing
more or less than the most brilliant student ever
seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged
to be his friends benefited from his example, not to
mention his help and encouragement, with which he
was always generous. He confessed to me in later life
that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure
lay in teaching.
He not only won every prize of note that the
school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the
day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and
Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges
in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore’s future career seemed likely to be meteoric,
and the only question that remained was when he
would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point
of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial
ambitions.
Three years after we had started at Hogwarts,
17
Chapter 2
Albus’s brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They
were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and,
unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that
the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along
as comfortably as two such different boys could do.
In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that
living in Albus’s shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually
outshone was an occupational hazard of being his
friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable
as a brother.
When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to
take the then-traditional tour of the world together,
visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus’s
mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and
sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra’s
funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to
care for, and little gold left to them, there could no
longer be any question of Albus accompanying me.
That was the period of our lives when we had
least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from
narrow escapes from chimeras in Greece to the ex18
In Memoriam
periments of Egyptian alchemists. His letters told
me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to
be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with horror
that I heard, toward the end of my year’s travels,
that yet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana.
Though Ariana had been in poor health for a
long time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss
of their mother, had a profound effect on both of
her brothers. All those closest to Albus-and I count
myself one of that lucky number-agree that Ariana’s
death, and Albus’s feeling of personal responsibility
for it (though of course, he was guiltless), left their
mark upon him forevermore.
I returned home to find a young man who had
experienced a much older person’s suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less
lighthearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between
Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In
time this would lift-in later years they reestablished,
if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial
one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of
Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to
mention them.
Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore’s innumerable contributions to the state of Wizarding knowledge, including
19
Chapter 2
his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood,
will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom
he displayed in the many judgments he made while
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still,
that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between
Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who
witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe
they felt as they watched these two extraordinary
wizards do battle. Dumbledore’s triumph, and its
consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the
introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy
or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he
could find something to value in anyone, however
apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe
that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship
more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world’s. That he was the
most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts
headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he
lived, working always for the greater good and, to
his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a
small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day
that I met him.
Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar,
kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon specta20
In Memoriam
cles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of betraying Harry,
whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.
He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since
reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had
barely known him at all. Never one had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into
being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and
old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying
to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No
doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it
had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in
that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought
to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his
other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry,
Harry’s past, Harry’s future, Harry’s plans . . . and it seemed to
Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and
so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when
he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though
the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was
also the only on he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered
honestly:
“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”
“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”
After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the obituary out of
the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume
of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts.
Then he threw the rest of the newspaper into the rubbish pile and
turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left
21
Chapter 2
out of place were today’s Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and
on top of it, the piece of broken mirror.
Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the
piece of broken mirror.
Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced
at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the
delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after nothing that it said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that
the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about
Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had
missed.
Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was
set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:
DUMBLEDORE—THE TRUTH AT LAST?
Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed
genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard
of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter
reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth,
the lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave. WHY was the man
tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a
mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of
the secret organization known as the Order of the
Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his
end?
22
In Memoriam
The answers to these and many more questions
are explored in the explosive new biography, The
Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter,
exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page
13, inside.
Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The
article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face:
a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde
hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning
smile, wiggling her fingers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this
nauseating image, Harry read on.
In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and
softer than her famously ferocious quill-portraits
might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her
cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen
for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes
without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip.
“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s
dream,” says Skeeter. “Such a long, full life. I’m
sure my book will be the first of very, very many.”
Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her
nine-hundred-page book was completed a mere four
weeks after Dumbledore’s mysterious death in June.
I ask her how she managed this superfast feat.
“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as
I have, working to a deadline is second nature. I
knew that the Wizarding world as clamoring for the
full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that
need.”
23
Chapter 2
I mentioned the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore’s, that “Skeeter’s book contains less fact than
a Chocolate frog card.”
Skeeter throws back her head and laughs.
“Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him
a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him.
Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting
at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me
to watch out for trout.”
And yet Elphias Doge’s accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter
really feel that four short weeks have been enough
to gain a full picture of Dumbledore’s long and extraordinary life?
“Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles, “you know as well
as I do how much information can be generated by
a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word
‘no,’ and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People
were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought he was so wonderful,
you know—he trod on an awful lot of important
toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I’ve had access to a source most
journalists would swap their wands for, one who has
never spoken in public before and who was close to
Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturb24
In Memoriam
ing phase of his youth.”
The advance publicity of Skeeter’s biography has
certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store
for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a
blameless life. What were the biggest surprises she
uncovered, I ask?
“Now, come off it, Betty, I’m not giving away all
the highlights before anybody’s bought the book!”
laughs Skeeter. “But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his
beard is in for a rude awakening! Let’s just say
that nobody hearing him rage against You-KnowWho would have dreamed that he dabbled in the
Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard
who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he
wasn’t exactly broad-minded when he was younger!
Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky
past, not to mention that very fishy family, which
he worked so hard to keep hushed up.”
I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the
Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor
scandal fifteen years ago.
“Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap.”
laughs Skeeter. “No, no, I’m talking about much
worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling
about with goats, worse even than the Mugglemaiming father—Dumbledore couldn’t keep either
of them quiet anyway, they were both charged by
25
Chapter 2
the Wizengamot. No, it’s the mother and the sister
that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a
positive nest of nastiness—but, as I say, you’ll have
to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details.
All I can say now is, it’s no wonder Dumbledore
never talked about how his nose got broken.”
Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter
deny the brilliance that led to Dumbledore’s many
magical discoveries?
“He had brains,” she concedes, “although many
now question whether he could really take full credit
for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in
chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when
Dumbledore ‘borrowed’ his papers.”
But the importance of some of Dumbledore’s
achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What
of his famous defeat of Grindelwald?
“Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,” says Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. “I’m
afraid those who go dewy eyed over Dumbledore’s
spectacular victory must brace themselves for a
bombshell— or perhaps a Dungbomb. very dirty
business indeed. All I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that
there really was the spectacular duel of legend. After they’ve read my book, people may be forced to
conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white
handkerchief from the end of his wand and came
quietly!”
26
In Memoriam
Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this
intriguing subject, so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers
more than any other.
“Oh yes,” says Skeeter, nodding briskly, “I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship. It’s been called unhealthy, even
sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my
book for the whole story, but there is no question
that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in
the boy’s best interests—well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most
troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry
Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year:
a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had
returned.
“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says
Skeeter. “Poor Potter has few real friends, and we
met at one of the most testing moments of his life—
the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of
the only people alive who can say that they know
the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still
circulating about Dumbledore’s final hours. Does
Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died?
27
Chapter 2
“Well, I don’t wan to say too much—it’s all in
the book—but the eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts
castle saw Potter running away from the scene
moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was
pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against whom he has a notorious
grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the
Wizarding community to decide— once they’ve read
my book.”
On that intriguing note, I take my leave. there
can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant
bestseller, Dumbledore’s legions of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to
emerge about their hero.
Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare
blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit;
he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the
wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his
overflowing bin.
He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty
drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same
piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases
from Rita’s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to
the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship . . . It’s been called unhealthy, even sinister . . . He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in
his youth . . . I’ve had access to a source most journalists would
swap their wands for . . .
“Lies!” Harry bellowed, and though the window he saw the
next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower,
28
In Memoriam
look up nervously.
Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror
danced away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his
fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which
Rita Skeeter was defaming him. . . .
A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on
the jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must
have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly
peach color of Aunt Petunia’s choosing: There was nothing blue
there for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment
again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back
at him.
He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it,
because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything
was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore
would never pierce him again.
29
Chapter 3
The Dursleys Departing
T
he sound of the front door slamming echoed up the
stair and a voice yelled, “Oi, You!” Sixteen years of
being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom his
uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately
respond. He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for
a split second, he had thought he say Dumbledore’s eye. It was
not until his uncle bellowed, “BOY!” that Harry got slowly to his
feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of
broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking
with him.
“You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of the stairs. “Get down here, I want a word!”
Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets.
When he reached the living room he found all three Dursleys. They
were dressed for traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket,
Aunt Petunia in a neat salmon-colored coat, and Dudly, Harry’s
large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket.
30
The Dursleys Departing
“Yes?” asked Harry.
“Sit down!” said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Please!” added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word
was sharp in his throat.
Harry sat. He though he knew what was coming. His uncle
began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following
his movements with anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple
face crumpled with concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front
of Harry and spoke.
“I’ve changed my mind,” he said.
“What a surprise,” said Harry.
“Don’t you talk in that tone— ” began Aunt Petunia in a shrill
voice, but Vern Dursley waved her down.
“It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry
with piggy little eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it.
We’re staying put, we’re not going anywhere.”
Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation
and amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every
twenty-four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking
ad repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry’s favorite
moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had
been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and
collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.
“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his
pacing up and down the living room, “we—Petunia, Dudley, and
I— are in danger. From— from— ”
“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a
31
Chapter 3
halt in front of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking
it’s over, and I believe it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead
starting to pulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing
around here! You want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will
be in your name and— ”
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get
this house? Are you actually as stupid as you look?”
“Don’t you dare—!” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it
seemed, as nothing to the danger he has spotted.
“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a
house, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one?
All the happy memories?”
There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his
uncle with this argument.
“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again,
“that this Lord Thing— ”
“—Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been
through this about a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim,
it’s fact, Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr.
Weasley— ”
Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry
guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward of recollections of
the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry’s summer holidays,
of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley
Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant
32
The Dursleys Departing
shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr.
Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.
“—Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry
pressed on remorselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, the protective
charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well
as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to
torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks
by holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue you.”
Uncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that
in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. Then
Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into
hiding and the Order wants to help. You’re being offered serious
protection, the best there is.”
Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down.
Outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door
neighbor’s lawn mower stalled again.
“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Dursley abruptly.
“There is,” said Harry, surprised.
“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as
innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked
man, we ought to qualify for government protection!”
Harry laughed; he could not stop himself. It was so typical of
his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this
world that he despised and mistrusted.
“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry
replied. “We think the Ministry has been infiltrated.”
Uncle Vernon stroke to the fireplace and back, breathing so
33
Chapter 3
heavily that his great black mustache tippled, his face still purple
with concentration.
“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. “All
right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection.
I still don’t see why we can’t have that Kingsley bloke.”
Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This
question has also been addressed half a dozen times.
“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth. “Kingsley is
protecting the Mug— I mean, your Prime Minister.”
“Exactly—he’s the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the
blank television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the
news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister
as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had
mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a
certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused
the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly
not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they
had never seen him with his earring in.
“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and Dedalus
Diggle are more than up to the job— ”
“If we’d even seen CVs . . . ” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry
lost patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now
pointing at the TV set himself.
“These accidents aren’t accidents— the crashes and explosions
and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last
watched the new. People are disappearing and dying and he’s
behind it—Voldemort. I’ve told you this over and over again, he
kills Muggles for fun. Even the fogs— they’re caused by dementors,
and if you can’t remember what they are, ask your son!”
34
The Dursleys Departing
Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his
parents’ and Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again
and asked, “There are . . . more of them?”
“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked
us, you mean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe
thousands by this time, seeing as they feed of fear and despair— ”
“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made
your point— ”
“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all
of them—Death Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi—which
means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark Wizard—will be able
to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember
the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you’ll agree you
need help.”
There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid
smashing something down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking
at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But what about my work? What about Dudley’s
school? I don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout
wizards— ”
“Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will torture
and kill you like they did my parents!”
“Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, “Dad— I’m going with these
Order people.”
“Dudley,” said Harry, “for the first time in your life, you’re
talking sense.”
He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened
enough to accept the Order’s help, his parents would accompany
35
Chapter 3
him: There could be no question of being separated from their
Duddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece.
“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and when
none of the Dursleys replied, he left the room. The prospect of
parting—probably forever— from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was
one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was
nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say
to one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike?
Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack,
then poked a couple of own nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage.
They fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.
“We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And then
you’ll be able to fly again.”
The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of
his room and downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and
Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own.
“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry
had opened the door, a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping
him a deep bow. “An honor, as ever!”
“Thanks, Dedalus,” said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark-haired Hestia. “It’s really good of
you to do this . . . They’re through here, my aunt and uncle and
cousin . . . ”
“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus happily, striding into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all
happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change
of mind. Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the
witch and wizard.
“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry
36
The Dursleys Departing
has told you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, pulling an immense
pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. “We shall
be leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic
in your house—Harry being still underage, it could provide the
Ministry with an excuse to arrest him—we shall be driving, say,
ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have
picked out for you. You know how to drive, I take it?” he asked
Uncle Vernon politely.
“Know how to—? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!”
spluttered Uncle Vernon.
“Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I personally would be
utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus.
He was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon
Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every
word Dedalus spoke.
“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus or Hestia seemed to hear him.
“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your
guard. There has been a little change in the arrangements— ”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought Mad-Eye
was going to come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?”
“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. “Mad-Eye will explain.”
The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter
incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched,
“Hurry up!” Harry looked all around the room before realizing
that the voice had issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch.
“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said
Dedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waist37
Chapter 3
coat. “We are attempting to time your departure from the house
with your family’s Disapparition, Harry: thus, the charm breaks
as the moment you all head for safety.” He turned to the Dursleys.
“Well, are we all packed and ready to go?”
None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring,
appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.
“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured Hestia. She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them
to remain in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged
loving, possibly tearful farewells.
“There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made
any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly,
“Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.”
He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at
the last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist
and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.
“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp
of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.
Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly
ajar, reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.
“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon.
He had already reached the living room door when Dudley
mumbled, “I don’t understand.”
“What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia,
looking up at her son.
Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry.
“Why isn’t he coming with us?”
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring
at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a
38
The Dursleys Departing
ballerina.
“What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly.
“Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley.
“Well, he—he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to
glare at Harry and asking, “You don’t want to, do you?”
“Not in the slightest,” said Harry.
“There you are,” Uncle Vernon told Dudley. “Now come on,
we’re off.”
He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open,
but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt
Petunia stopped too.
“What now?” barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway.
It seems that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. After sever moments of apparently painful
internal struggle he said, “But where’s he going to go?”
Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was
clear that Dudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the
silence.
“But . . . surely you know where your nephew is going?” she
asked, looking bewildered.
“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s off with some
of your lot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard
the man, we’re in a hurry,”
Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but
Dudley did not follow.
“Off with some of our lot?”
Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before.
Witches and wizards seems stunned that his closest living relatives
39
Chapter 3
took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter.
“It’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, honestly.”
“Doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously.
“Don’t these people realize what you’ve been through? What dangers you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the
anti-Voldemort movement?”
“Er—no, they don’t,” said Harry. “They think I’m a waste of
space actually, but I’m used to— ”
“I don’t think you’re a waste of space.”
If Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might not have
believed it. As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds
before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken
for one thing. Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and
astonished himself.
“Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley.”
Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy
for expression before mumbling, “You saved my life.”
“Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the dementor would
have taken . . . ”
He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no
contact during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to
Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. It now
dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he
had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at
all. Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved
that Dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his
feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley
subsided into scarlet-faced silence.
Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an ap40
The Dursleys Departing
proving look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward
and embraced Dudley rather than Harry.
“S–so sweet, Dudders . . . ” she sobbed into his massive chest.
“S–such a lovely b–boy . . . s–saying thank you . . . ”
“But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia indignantly.
“He only said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!”
“Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’” said
Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from
a burning building.
“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet
again at the living room door. “I though we were on a tight schedule!”
“Yes—yes, we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to
pull himself together. “We really must be off, Harry— ”
He tripped forward and wrung Harry’s hand with both of his
own.
“— good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon your shoulders.”
“Oh,” said Harry. “right. Thanks.”
“Farewell, Harry,” said Hestia, also clasping his hand. “Our
thoughts go with you.”
“I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward
Aunt Petunia and Dudley.
“Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said Diggle
lightly, waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him.
Dudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and
walked toward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him
41
Chapter 3
with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand.
“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs.
“did the dementors blow a different personality into you?”
“Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.”
“Yeah . . . ” said Harry, taking Dudley’s hand and shaking it.
“Maybe. Take care, Big D.”
Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry
heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car
door slammed.
Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief,
looked around at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to
find herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief
into her pocket, she said, “Well— good-bye,” and marched toward
the door without looking at him.
“Good-bye,” said Harry.
She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the
strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him. She
gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge
of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out
of the room after her husband and son.
42
Chapter 4
The Seven Potters
H
arry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the
window just in time to see the Dursleys’ cat swinging
out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus’s top
hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in
the backseat. The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its
windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and
then it was gone.
Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack,
gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and
then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he
deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs.
The light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the
evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence
and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time.
Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went
out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare
treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he
had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley’s computer, or put on the
43
Chapter 4
television and flicked through the channels to his heart’s content.
It gave him an odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was
like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost.
“Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking, with her head under her wing. “We’ll
never be here again. Don’t you want to remember all the good
times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories . . . Dudley
puked on it after I saved him from the dementors. . . . Turns out
he was grateful after all, can you believe it? . . . And last summer,
Dumbledore walked through that front door. . . .”
Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig
did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her
head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.
“And under here, Hedwig”—Harry pulled open a door under
the stairs— “is where I used to sleep; You never knew me then—
Blimey, it’s small, I’d forgotten. . . .”
Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the
underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned
with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known
anything about his true identity; before he had found out how
his parents had died or why such strange things often happened
around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had
dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes
of green light and once—Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car
when Harry had recounted it— a flying motorbike . . .
There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby.
Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head
on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle
44
The Seven Potters
Vernon’s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen,
clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back
garden.
The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering.
Then, one by one, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid,
wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people
were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black
winged horses.
Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst.
There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms
around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, “All
righ’, Harry? Ready fer the off?”
“Definitely,” said Harry, beaming around at them all. “But I
wasn’t expecting this many of you!”
“Change of plan,” growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous, bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from
darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. “Let’s
get undercover before we talk you through it.”
Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and
chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless
appliances: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied
back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill,
badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding,
his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his
bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short
hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more
45
Chapter 4
lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde
hair; Kingsley, taller and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild
hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on
the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog,
with his droopy bloodhound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s heart
seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of
all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the
last time they had met.
“Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime
Minister?” he called across the room.
“He can get along without me for one night,” said Kingsley.
“You’re more important.”
“Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on top of the
washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring
glittered there.
“You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.
“I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.”
“That’s brilliant, congrat— ”
“All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later,”
roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen.
Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry, “As
Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He’s made it
an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network,
place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name
of your protection to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you.
Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already. What he’s really done is to stop you from getting out of
here safely.
46
The Seven Potters
“Second problem. You’re underage, which means you’ve still
got the Trace on you.”
“I don’t— ”
“The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. “The
charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the
way the Ministry finds out out about underage magic! If you, or
anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse
is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.
“We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you
turn seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you.
In short: Pius Thicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and
proper.”
Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.
“So what are we going to do?”
“We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the
only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast
spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.”
Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue
to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them.
“Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, or”—Moody gestured around the
pristine kitchen— “you no longer call this place home. You and
your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the
full understanding that you’re never going to live together again,
correct?”
Harry nodded.
“So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and
the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’ve
choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for
47
Chapter 4
You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.
“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You-Know-who
doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail
to the Ministry: They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth.
However, this is You-Know-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t
just rely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to have a
couple Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just
in case. So we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection
we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place
we’re going to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the
Order: my house, Kingsley’s place, Molly auntie Muriel’s—you get
the idea.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could
still spot a gaping hole in the plan.
“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the
boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house
you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”
“Er—yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the
twelve secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort
of obvious once”—he performed a quick headcount— “fourteen of
us fly off towards Tonks’s parents’?”
“Ah,” said Moody. “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen
of us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents. There will be seven Harry
Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a
companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.”
From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what
looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word;
Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.
48
The Seven Potters
“No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen.
“No way!”
“I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione with a hint
of complacency.
“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives—!”
“—because it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron.
“This is different, pretending to be me— ”
“Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,” said Fred earnestly.
“Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky,
sccrawny gits forever.”
Harry did not smile.
“You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you
some hair.”
“Well, that’s that plan scuppered,” said George. “Obviously
there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you
cooperate.”
“Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use
magic: we’ve got no chance,” said Fred.
“Funny,” said Harry, “really amusing.”
“If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his
magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at
Harry.
“Everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to
take the risk.”
Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved
sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head.
“Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a
few of your hairs, boy, now.”
“But this is mad, there’s no need— ”
49
Chapter 4
“No need!” snarled Moody, “With You-Know-Who out there
and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have
swallowed the fake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on
the thirtieth, but he’d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two
keeping an eye out, it’s what I’d do. They might not be able to
get at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds, but it’s
about to break and they know the rough position of the place.
Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can’t split
himself into seven.”
Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once.
“So, Potter— some of your hair, if you please.”
Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort
of way.
“Now!” barked Moody.
With all of their eyes on him, Harry reached up to the top of
his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.
“Good,” said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper
out of the flask of potion. “Straight in here, if you please.”
Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment
it made contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and
smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold.
“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,”
said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows,
blushing slightly, and saying, “Oh, you now what I mean—Goyle’s
potion looked like bogies.”
“Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please.” said
Moody.
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of
Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink.
50
The Seven Potters
“We’re one short,” said Lupin.
“Here,” said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the
scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred
and George instead.
“I’ve told yer, I’d sooner be a protector,” said Mundungus.
“Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-who
would want to finish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who
have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill
them.”
Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was
already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his
cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion
into each one.
“Altogether, then . . . ”
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank.
All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats.
At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax.
Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and
George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione’s and
Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls.
Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the
large sacks he had brought with him. When he straightened up
again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front
of him.
Fred and George turned to each other and said together,
“Wow—we’re identical!”
51
Chapter 4
“I dunno, though. I think I’m still better looking,” said Fred,
examining his reflection in the kettle.
“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill,
don’t look at me— I’m ’ideous.”
“Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,”
said Moody, indicating the first sack, “and vice versa. Don’t forget
the glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re
dressed, there’s luggage in the other sack.”
The real Harry thought this might just be the most bizarre thing
he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He
watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling
out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, and stuffing their own things
away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his
privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly more
at ease with displaying his body than they would have with their
own.
“I knew Ginny was lying about that that tattoo,” said Ron,
looking down at his bare chest.
“Harry, your eyesight really is awful,” said Hermione, as she
put on glasses.
Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages,
each containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack.
“Good,” said Moody, as at last the seven dressed, bespectacled,
and luggage-laden Harrys faced him. “The pairs will be as follows:
Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom— ”
“Why’m I with you?” grunted the Harry nearest the back door.
“Because you’re the one that needs watching,” growled Moody,
and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus
as he continued. “Arthur and Fred— ”
52
The Seven Potters
“I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was pointing,
“Can’t you even tell us apart when we’re Harry?”
“Sorry, George— ”
“I’m only yanking your wand. I’m Fred really— ”
“Enough messing around!!” snarled Moody. “The other one—
George or Fred or whoever you are—you’re with Remus. Miss
Delacour— ”
“I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond
of brooms.”
Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy,
slavish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear
on his face again.
“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral— ”
Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile;
Harry knew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick.
“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking
over a mug tree as she waved at him.
Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.
“An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all right?” said Hagrid,
looking a little anxious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals
can’t take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me
on it, though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.”
“That’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully.
“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,”
said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. “Snape’s
had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never
mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re
betting they’ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a
broomstick. All right then,” he went on, tying up the sack with the
53
Chapter 4
fake Potters’ clothes in it and leading the way back to the door,
“I make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point
locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when
they come looking. Come on . . . ”
Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig’s
cage and followed the ground to the dark back garden.
On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands. Hermione
had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley,
Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the
motorbike, goggles on.
“Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?”
“The very same,” said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. “An’
the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!”
Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into
the sidecar. It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron
smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper
car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet
and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees. It was extremely
uncomfortable.
“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite oblivious
to Harry’s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle,
which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. “It’s got
a few tricks up its hindquarters now. Tha’ one was my idea.”
He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer.
“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his broomstick. “I’m still not sure this
was advisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies.”
“All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please. I want
54
The Seven Potters
us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the
diversion’s lost.”
Everybody mounted their brooms.
“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw
a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either
side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life. It roared
like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate.
“Good luck, everyone,” shouted Moody, “See you all in
about an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three.
One . . . two . . . THREE.”
There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the
sidecar give a nasty lurch. He was rising through the air fast, his
eyes water slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him
brooms were soaring upward too, the long black tail of a threstral
flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage
and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So
great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse
of number four, Privet Drive, by the time he looked over the edge
of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and
higher they climbed into the sky—
And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded.
At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a
vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen,
oblivious—
Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell
and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they
were. Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging
to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his
rucksack slipped from beneath his knees.
55
Chapter 4
“No—HEDWIG!”
The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize
the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike
swung the right way up again. A second’s relief, and then another
burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the
cage.
“No—NO!”
The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death
Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.
“Hedwig—Hedwig — ”
But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of
her cage. He could not take it in in, and his terror for the others
was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of
people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms
soaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were—
“Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled
over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig’s cage into the floor, refusing to believe that she was
dead. “Hagrid, TURN AROUND!”
“My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, and
he opened the throttle.
“Stop—STOP!” Harry shouted, but he looked back again as
two jets of green light flew past his left year: Four Death Eaters
had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming
for Hagrid’s broad back. Hagrid swerved but the Death Eaters
were keeping up with the bike, more curses shot after them, and
Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling
around he cried, “Stupefy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his
own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters
56
The Seven Potters
as they scattered to avoid it.
“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do it for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry
looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into
a green button near the fuel gauge.
A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe.
Craning his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three
of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not
so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder
from behind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne wall were
swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars
and sped up.
More Killing Curses flew past Harry’s head from the two remaining Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry
responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided
in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought
wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea
what was happening—
“Here we go again, Harry, hold on!” yelled Hagrid, and he
jabbed at a second button. This time a great net burst from the
bike’s exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did
they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save
their unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out
of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike,
all shooting curses after it.
“This’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!” yelled Hagrid, and Harry
saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the
speedometer.
With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from
57
Chapter 4
the exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward
like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death
Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and
at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration.
“It’s all righ’, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto
his back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the
sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike’s slipstream.
“I’m on it, Harry, don’ worry!” Hagrid yelled, and from inside
his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella. “Hagrid! No!
Let me!”
“REPARO!”
There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from
the bike completely. Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus
of the bike’s flight, then the sidecar began to lose height—
In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and
shouted “Wingardium Leviosa!”
The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne. He had but a split second’s relief, however, as more curses
streaked past him: The three Death Eaters were closing in.
“I’m comin’, Harry!” Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness,
but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching
as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures
and yelled, “Impedimenta!”
The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; For a moment
the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit
an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him—
Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining
Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck
58
The Seven Potters
below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his
seat—
“I’m comin’, Harry, I’m comin’!”
A huge hand seized the back of Harry’s robes and hoisted him
out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him
as he dragged himself onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself
back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the
two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth,
pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, “Confringo!”
He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and
fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished.
“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned Hagrid, “I shouldn’ta
tried ter repair it myself—yeh’ve got no room— ”
“It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” Harry shouted back,
as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing
closer.
As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again,
Hagrid swerved and zigzagged. Harry knew that Hagrid did not
dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at
their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking
jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and
his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell,
Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike—Stan—
“Expelliarmus!” Harry yelled.
“That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!”
The hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the
thunder of the motorbike’s engine. Next moment, both pursuers
59
Chapter 4
had fallen back and disappeared from view.
“Harry, what’s happened?” bellowed Hagrid, “Where’ve they
gone?”
“I don’t know!”
But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted
“It’s the real one!”; how had he known? He gazed around at the
apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they?
He clamored around on the seat to face forward and seized hold
of the back of Hagrid’s jacket.
“Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of here!”
“Hold on tight, then, Harry!”
There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue
fire shot from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backward off
what little of the seat he had, Hagrid flung backward upon him,
barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars—
“I think we’ve lost ’em Harry, I think we’ve done it!!” yelled
Hagrid.
But Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked
left and right for pursuers he was sue would come. . . . Why had they
fallen back? One of them had sitll had a wand. . . . It’s him . . . it’s
the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm
Stan. . . .
“We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted
Hagrid.
Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the
ground still seemed remote as stars.
Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire: as a Death Eater
appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry
by millimeters, cast from behind—
60
The Seven Potters
And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on
the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his
wand again—
Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a
vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells
flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past
him and knew he had hit one of them, but he heard a bang and
saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the
air, completely out of control—
Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea
which way was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he
expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick
was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm—
“NO!”
With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the
Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death
Eater falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the
broomstick—
Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry
heard Voldemort scream, “Mine!!”
It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he
glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard,
“Avada — ”
As the pain from Harry’s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand
acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some
great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed
eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death
Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, “No!”; Somehow, Harry found
61
Chapter 4
his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched it with
his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air,
hurtling straight toward the ground.
“Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life.
“Hagrid—Accio Hagrid!”
The motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level
with the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights
growing nearer and nearer. He was going to crash and there was
nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream,
“Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!”
He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he
stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing
he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse him once more—
And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw
Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard at
the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with
an earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy
pond.
62
Chapter 5
Fallen Warrior
H
agrid?”
Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of
metal and leather that surrounded him: his hands sank
into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand. He
could not understand where Voldemort had gone and expected him
to swoop out of the darkness at any moment. Something hot and
wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled
out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the
ground that was Hagrid.
“Hagrid? Hagrid. Talk to me— ”
But the dark mass did not stir.
“Who’s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?”
Harry did not recognize the man’s voice. Then a woman
shouted, “They’ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in the garden!”
Harry’s head was swimming.
“Hagrid.” he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled.
The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt
like cushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm.
63
Chapter 5
His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was
still throbbing.
“Hagrid?”
He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an
unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a
short distance away, wed and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied
man was watching Harry anxiously.
“Hagrid’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to him
now. How are you feeling? Anything else broken? I’ve fixed your
ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I’m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks—
Dora’s father.”
Harry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and
he felt sick and giddy.
“Voldemort— ”
“Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions. “That was a nasty
crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong
with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and
his Muggle contraptions?”
“No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. “Death
Eaters, loads of them—we were chased— ”
“Death eaters?” said Ted sharply. “What d’you mean, Death
Eaters? I thought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight,
I thought— ”
“They knew,” said Harry.
Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see
through to the sky above.
Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don’t we?
They shouldn’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place
64
Fallen Warrior
in any direction.”
Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished: it had
been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the
Order’s charms. He only hoped they would continue to work: He
imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke,
looking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great
transparent bubble.
He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with
his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive. He had
barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed
through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but
miraculously alive.
“Harry!” Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra,
he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled Harry
into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs. “Blimey,
Harry, how did yeh get out o’ that? I thought we were both goners.”
“Yeah, me too. I can’t believe— ”
Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid.
“You!” he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but
it was empty.
“Your wand’s here, son,” said Ted, tapping it on Harry’s arm.
“It fell tight beside you, I picked it up. And that’s my wife you’re
shouting at.”
“Oh, I’m— I’m sorry.”
As shed moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced. Her
hair was a light, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder.
Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry’s exclamation.
65
Chapter 5
“What happened to our daughter?” she asked. “Hagrid said
you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?”
“I don’t know,” said Harry. “We don’t know what happened to
anyone else.”
She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt
gripped Harry at the sight of their expressions; if any of the other
had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the
plan, given them his hair. . . .
“The Portkey,” he said, remembering all of a sudden. “We’ve
got to get back to the Burrow and find out— then we’ll be able to
send word, or— or Tonks will, once she’s— ”
“Dora’ll be okay,’Dromeda,” said Ted. “She knows her stuff,
she’s been in plenty of tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey’s
through here,” he added to Harry. “It’s supposed to leave in three
minutes, if you want to take it.”
“Yeah, we do,” said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it
onto his shoulders. “I— ”
He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of
fear in which he left her and for which eh felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that did not seem hollow and
insincere.
“I’ll tell Tonks—Dora— to send word, when she . . . Thanks for
patching us up, thanks for everything. I— ”
He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along
a short hallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them,
bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel.
“There you go, son. That’s the Portkey.”
Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush
lying on the dressing table.
66
Fallen Warrior
“Thanks,” said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready
to leave.
“Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around. “Harry, where’s
Hedwig?”
“She . . . she got hit,” said Harry.
The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as
the tears stung his eyes. The owl had bee his companion, his one
great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to
return to the Dursleys.
Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on
the shoulder.
“Never mind,” he said gruffly. “Never mind. She had a great
old life— ”
“Hagrid!” said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed
bright blue, and Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time.
With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and
line had dragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness,
spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and
Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Seconds later Harry’s feet
slammed into hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees
in the yard of the Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside
the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly,
and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the
back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered
laboriously to his feet.
“Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are
the others?” cried Mrs. Weasley.
“What d’you mean? Isn’t anyone else back?” Harry panted.
The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley’s pale face.
67
Chapter 5
“The Death Eaters were waiting for us,” Harry told her. “We
were surrounded the moment we took off— they knew it was
tonight— I don’t know what happened to anyone else, four of them
chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort
caught up with us— ”
He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the pleas for
her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her
sons, but—
“Thank goodness you’re all right,” she said, pulling him into a
hug he did not feel he deserved.
“Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly?” asked Hagrid a
little shakily. “Fer medicinal purposes?”
She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back
towards the crooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide
her face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea
for information at once.
“Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed
their Portkey, it came back without them.” she said, pointing at
a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. “And that one,” she
pointed at an ancient sneaker, “should have been Dad and Fred’s,
they were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,”
she checked her watch, “if they made it, George and Lupin ought
to be back in about a minute.”
Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which
she handed to Hagrid. He uncorked it and drank it straight down
in one.
“Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away.
A blue light had appeared in the darkness; It grew larger
and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then
68
Fallen Warrior
falling. Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong:
Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face
was covered in blood.
Harry ran forward and seized George’s legs. Together, he and
Lupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the
sitting room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell
across George’s head, Ginny gasped and Harry’s stomach lurched;
One of George’s ears was missing. The side of his head and neck
was drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood.
No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than Lupin
grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently,
back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease
his bulk through the back door.
“Oi!” said Hagrid indignantly. “Le’ go of him! Le’ go of Harry!”
Lupin ignored him.
“What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter
visited my office at Hogwarts?” he said, giving Harry a small shake.
“Answer me!”
“A— a grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?”
Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard.
“Wha’ was that’ about?” roared Hagrid.
“I’m sorry Harry, but I had to check” said Lupin tersely. “We’ve
been betrayed. Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight
and the only people who could have told him were directly involved
in the plan. You might have been an impostor.”
“So why aren’ you checkin’ me?” panted Hagrid, still struggling
with the door.
“You’re half-giant,” said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. “The
Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.”
69
Chapter 5
“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving
tonight,” said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not
believe it of any of them. “Voldemort only caught up with me
toward the end, he didn’t know which one I was in the beginning.
If he’d been in on the plan he’d have known from the start I was
the one with Hagrid.”
“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What
happened? How did you escape?”
Harry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them
had seemed to recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who
had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary
of Tonks’s parents.
“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”
“I . . . ” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like
a blur of panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know,
the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried
to Disarm him instead of—well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing,
does he? He must be Imperiused!”
Lupin looked aghast.
“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying
to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to
kill!”
“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself and if I
stunned him and he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d
used Avada Kedavra!! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two
years ago,” Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of
the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry
for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how to Disarm.
70
Fallen Warrior
“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great
number of Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me,
but it was a very unusual move then, under imminent threat of
death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either
witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!”
“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry
angrily.
“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters— frankly,
most people!—would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it
is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!”
Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a
grain of defiance inside him.
“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there.”
said Harry. “That’s Voldemort’s job.”
Lupin’s retort was last; Finally succeeding in squeezing through
the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down: it collapsed
beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry
addressed Lupin again.
“Will George be okay?”
All Lupin’s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the
question.
“I think so, although there’s no chance of replacing his ear, not
when it’s been cursed off—
There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back
door; Harry leapt over Hagrid’s legs and sprinted into the yard.
Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward
them he realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal
appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Her71
Chapter 5
mione flung herself into Harry’s arms, but Kingsley showed no
pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione’s shoulder
Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin’s chest.
“The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!”
“Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,” said Lupin calmly.
Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, “It’s him,
I’ve checked!”
“All right, all right!” said Kingsley, stowing his wand back
beneath his cloak. “But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they
knew it was tonight!”
“So it seems,” replied Lupin, “but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven Harrys.”
“Small comfort!” snarled Kingsley. “Who else is back?”
“Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.”
Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand.
“What happened to you?” Lupin asked Kingsley.
“Followed by five, injured two, might’ve killed one,” Kingsley
reeled off, “and we saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase
halfway through but vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can— ”
“Fly,” supplied Harry. “I saw him too, he came after Hagrid
and me.”
“So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley. “I couldn’t
understand why he’d vanished. But what made him change targets?”
“Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,” said
Lupin.
“Stan?” repeated Hermione. “But I thought he was in Azkaban?”
Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh.
72
Fallen Warrior
“Hermione, there’s obviously been a mass breakout which the
Ministry has hushed up. Traver’s hood fell off when I cursed him,
he’s supposed to be inside too. But what happened to you, Remus?
Where’s George?”
“He lost an ear,” said Lupin.
“Lost an—?” repeated Hermione in a high voice.
“Snape’s work,” said Lupin.
“Snape?” shouted Harry, “You didn’t say— ”
“He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always
a speciality of Snape’s. I wish I could say I’d paid him back in
kind, but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after
he was injured, he was loosing so much blood.”
Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at
the sky. There was no sign of movement; the stars stared back,
unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was
Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur,
Tonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus?
“Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from the door,
in which he was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled
him free, then headed through the empty kitchen and back into the
sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now,
and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean, gaping hole where George’s
ear had been.
“How is he?”
Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, “I can’t make it grow
back, not when it’s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could
have been so much worse . . . He’s alive.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Thank God.”
“Did I hear someone else in the yard?” Ginny asked.
73
Chapter 5
“Hermione and Kingsley,” said Harry.
“Thank goodness,” Ginny whispered. They looked at each
other. Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even
care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act
on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen.
“I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back
off if you know what’s good for you!”
Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He
burst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his
spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.
“Arthur!” sobbed Mrs. Weasley. “Oh thank goodness!”
“How is?”
Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first
time since Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words.
He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could
not believe what he was seeing.
Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father’s arrival,
George stirred.
“How do you feel, Georgie?” whispered Mrs. Weasley.
George’s fingers groped at the side of his head.
“Saintlike” he murmured.
“What’s wrong with him?” croaked Fred, looking terrified: “Is
his mind affected?”
“Saintlike,” repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up
at his brother. “You see . . . I’m holy. Holey. Fred: geddit?”
Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred’s
pale face.
“Pathetic,” he told George. “Pathetic! With the whole wide
world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?”
74
Fallen Warrior
“Ah well,” said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother.
“You’ll be able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.”
He looked around.
“Hi, Harry—you are Harry, right?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, moving closer to the sofa.
“Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George, “Why aren’t
Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?”
“They’re not back yet, George,” said Mrs. Weasley. George’s
grin faded. Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned her to accompany him back outside. As they walked through the kitchen she
said in a low voice,
“Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn’t have a
long journey; Auntie Muriel’s not that far from here.”
Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever
since reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to
crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As
they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took
his hand.
Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the
sky every time he turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon
pacing the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and
Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None
of them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent
vigil.
The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years.
The slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward
the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing
Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves—
And then a broom materialized directly above them and
75
Chapter 5
streaked toward the ground—
“It’s them!” screamed Hermione.
Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere.
“Remus!” Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into
Lupin’s arms. His face was set and white: He seemed unable to
speak. Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione.
“You’re okay,” he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and
hugged him tightly.
“I thought— I thought— ”
“’M all right,” said Ron, patting her on the back. “’M fine.”
“Ron was great,” said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on
Lupin. “Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to
the head, and when you’re aiming at a moving target from a flying
broom— ”
“You did?” said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms
still around his neck.
“Always the tone of surprise,” he said a little grumpily, breaking
free. “Are we the last back?”
“No,” said Ginny, “we’re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and
Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I’m going to tell Mum and Dad you’re
okay, Ron— ”
She ran back inside.
“So what kept you? What happened?” Lupin sounded almost
angry at Tonks.
“Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much as she
wants Harry, Remus, she tried very hard to kill me. I just wish
I’d got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus. . . . Then we got to Ron’s Auntie Muriel’s and we’d missed
76
Fallen Warrior
our Portkey and she was fussing over us— ”
A muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but seemed
unable to say anything else.
“So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning to Harry,
Hermione, and Kingsley.
They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the
time the continued absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad-eye, and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and
harder to ignore.
“I’m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have
been there an hour ago,” said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping
gaze at the sky. “Let me know when they’re back.”
Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked
away into the darkness toward the gate. Harry thought he heard
the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow’s
boundaries.
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny
behind them. Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin
and Tonks.
“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.”
“Don’t be silly, Molly,” said Tonks at once.
“How’s George?” asked Lupin.
“What’s wrong with him?” piped up Ron.
“He’s lost— ”
But the end of Mrs. Weasley’s sentence was drowned in a general outcry: A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few
feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but
unhurt.
“Bill! Thank God, thank God— ”
77
Chapter 5
Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her
was perfunctory. Looking directly at his father, he said, “MadEye’s dead.”
Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something
inside him was falling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever.
“We saw it,” said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on
her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. “It happened just
after we broke out of the circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by
us, they were heading north too, Voldemort—he can fly—went
straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye
tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort’s curse hit MadEye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and— there was
nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our
own tail— ”
Bill’s voice broke.
“Of course you couldn’t have done anything,” said Lupin.
They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite
comprehend it. Mad-Eye’s dead; it could not be . . . Mad-Eye, so
tough, so brave, the consummate survivor . . .
At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said
it, that there was no point waiting in the yard anymore, and in
silence they followed Mr. and Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow,
and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing
together.
“What’s wrong?” said Fred, scanning their faced as they entered. “What happened? Who’s—?”
“Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Weasley. “Dead.”
The twins’ grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed
78
Fallen Warrior
to know what to do. Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief;
She had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and his
at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on
the floor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at
his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief.
Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of
firewhisky and some glasses.
“Here,” he said, and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve
full classes soaring through the room to each of them, holding the
thirteenth aloft. “Mad-Eye,”
“Mad-Eye,” they all said, and drank.
“Mad-Eye,” echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup.
The firewhisky seared Harry’s throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality,
filling him with something that was like courage.
“So Mundungus disappeared?” said Lupin, who had drained
his own glass in one.
The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense,
watching Lupin, both wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry,
and slightly afraid of what they might hear.
“I know what you’re thinking,” said Bill. “and I wondered that
too, one the way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us,
didn’t they? But Mundungus can’t have betrayed us. They didn’t
know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment
we appeared, and in case you’ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who
suggested that little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn’t he have told
them the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it’s as simple as
that. He didn’t want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made
him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them. It was enough
79
Chapter 5
to make anyone panic.”
“You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,”
sniffed Tonks, “Mad-Eye said he’s expect the real Harry to be with
the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and
when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley. . . .”
“Yes, and zat eez all very good,” snapped Fleur, “but still eet
does not explain ’ow zey knew we were moving ’Arry tonight, does
it? Somebody must ’ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date
to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zeim knowing ze date
but not ze ’ole plan.”
She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her
beautiful face, silently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. The dnly sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid
hiccuping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid,
who had just risked his own life to save Harry’s—Hagrid, whom
he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giving
Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon’s egg. . . .
“No,” Harry said out loud, and they all looked at him, surprised.
The firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. “I mean . . . if
somebody made a mistake,” Harry went on, “and let something
slip, I know they didn’t mean to do it. It’s not their fault,” he
repeated, again a little louder than he would usually have spoken.
“We’ve got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don’t think
anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort.”
More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him;
Harry felt a little hot again and drank some more firewhisky for
something to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad-eye. Mad-Eye
had always been scathing about Dumbledore’s willingness to trust
people.
80
Fallen Warrior
“Well said, Harry,” said Fred unexpectedly.
“Yeah, ’ear, ’ear,” said George, with half a glance at Fred, the
corner of whose mouth twitched.
Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It
was close to pitying.
“You think I’m a fool?” demanded Harry.
“No, I think you’re like James,” said Lupin, “who would have
regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.”
Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had
been betrayed by his friend, Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally
angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him,
set down his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, “There’s
work to do, I can ask Kingsley whether— ”
“No,” said Bill at once, “I’ll do it, I’ll come.”
“Where are you going?” said Tonks and Fleur together.
“Mad-Eye’s body,” said Lupin. “We need to recover it.”
“Can’t it—?” began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at
Bill.
“Wait?” said Bill. “Not unless you’d rather the Death Eaters
took it?”
Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good bye and left.
The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except Harry, who
remained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was
with them like a presence.
“I’ve got to go to,” said Harry.
Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him.
“Don’t be silly, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley, “What are you
talking about?”
“I can’t stay here.”
81
Chapter 5
He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again. It had not hurt
like this for more than a year.
“You’re all in danger while I’m here. I don’t want— ”
“But don’t be so silly!” said Mrs. Weasley. “The whole point of
tonight was to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked.
And Fleur’s agreed to get married here rather than in France, and
we’ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look
after you— ”
She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not
better.
“If Voldemort finds out I’m here— ”
“But why should he?” asked Mrs. Weasley.
“There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,” said Mr.
Weasley. “He’s got no way of knowing which safe house you’re in.”
“It’s not me I’m worried for!” said Harry.
“We know that,” said Mr. Weasley quietly. “but it would make
our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left.”
‘Yer not goin’ anywhere,” growled Hagrid. “Blimey, Harry, after
all we wen’ through ter get you here?”
“Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?” said George, hoisting
himself upon his cushions.
“I know that— ”
“Mad—Eye wouldn’t want— ”
“I KNOW!” Harry bellowed.
He felt beleaguered and blackmailed. Did they think he did not
know what they had done for him, didn’t they understand that
it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now, before
they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and
awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb,
82
Fallen Warrior
and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley.
“Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly. “We can put
her up with Pigwidgeon and giver her something to eat.”
His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth.
He drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering.
“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said Hagrid.
“Escaped him, fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!”
“It wasn’t me,” said Harry flatly. “It was my wand. My wand
acted of its own accord.”
After a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But that’s impossible, Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to,
you reacted instinctively.”
“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling. I couldn’t have told
you where Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and
found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I
recognized. I’ve never made gold flames appear before.”
“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can often produce magic you’ve never dreamed of. Small
children often find, before they’re trained— ”
“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry, through gritted teeth. His car
was burning. He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that
they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort’s.
No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him.
Now that he came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand
performing magic on its own before.
His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan
aloud. Mutter about fresh air, he set his glass down and left the
room.
As he crossed the dark yard, the great skeletal thestral looked
83
Chapter 5
up, rustled its enormous batlike wings, then resumed its grazing.
Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore.
Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore
would have known how and why Harry’s wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had known
about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that
existed between his wand and Voldemort’s. . . . But Dumbledore,
like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all
were gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a
burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky. . . .
And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he
clutched his forehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside
his head.
“You told me the problem would be solved by using another’s
wand!”
And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man
lying in rags upon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible, drawn-out
scream, a scream of unendurable agony. . . .
“No! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . .”
“You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!”
“I did not. . . . I swear I did not. . . .”
“You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!”
“I swear I did not. . . . I believed a different wand would
work. . . .”
“Explain, then, what happened. Lucius’s wand is destroyed!”
“I cannot understand. . . . The connection . . . exists only . . . between your two wands. . . .”
84
Fallen Warrior
“Lies!”
“Please. . . . I beg you. . . .”
And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort’s surge of vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the floor
writhe in agony—
“Harry?”
It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in
the darkness, clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing,
his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realized
that Ron and Hermione were at his side.
“Harry, come back in the house,” Hermione whispered. “You
aren’t still thinking of leaving?”
“Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said Ron, thumping Harry on
the back.
“Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough now to look
into Harry’s face. “You look awful!”
“Well,” said Harry shakily, “I probably look better than Ollivander. . . .”
When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked
appalled, but Hermione downright terrified.
“But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar—it wasn’t
supposed to do this anymore! You mustn’t let that connection
open up again—Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!”
When he did not reply, she gripped his arm.
“Harry, he’s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and
half the Wizarding world! Don’t let him inside your head too!”
85
Chapter 6
The Ghoul in Pajamas
T
he shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in
the days that followed; Harry kept expecting to see
him stumping in through the back door like the other
Order members, who passed in and out to relay news.
Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of
guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find
and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.
“Well, you can’t do anything about the”—Ron mouthed the
word Horcruxes — “till you’re seventeen. You’ve still got the Trace
on you. And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can’t we? Or,”
he dropped his voice to a whisper, “d’you reckon you already know
where the You-Know-Whats are?”
“No,” Harry admitted.
“I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said Ron.
“She said she was saving it for when you got here.”
They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill
had just left for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake
86
The Ghoul in Pajamas
Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.
“The Trace’ll break on the thirty-first,” said Harry. “That
means I only need to stay here four days. Then I can— ”
“Five days,” Ron corrected him firmly. “We’ve got to stay for
the wedding. They’ll kill us if we miss it.”
Harry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley.
“It’s one extra day,” said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous.
“Don’t they realize how important—?”
“’Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a clue. And
now you mention it, I want to talk to you about that.”
Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs.
Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.
“Mum’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What
we’re off to do. She’ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and
Lupin’ve both asked us as well, but when we said Dumbledore
told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum,
though. She’s determined.”
Ron’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch,
Mrs. Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to
help identify a lone man’s sock that she thought might’ve come out
of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off
the kitchen, she started.
“Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are
dropping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Well, yeah. We are.”
The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out
what looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.
“May I ask why you are abandoning your education?” said Mrs.
87
Chapter 6
Weasley.
“Well, Dumbledore left me . . . stuff to do,” mumbled Harry.
“Ron and Hermione know about it, and they want to come too.”
“What sort of ‘stuff’?”
“I’m sorry, I can’t— ”
“Well, frankly I think Arthur and I have a right to know and
I’m sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would agree!” said Mrs. Weasley.
Harry had been afraid of the “concerned parent” attack. He forced
himself to look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did that they
were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny’s. This did not
help.
“Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley.
I’m sorry, Ron and Hermione don’t have to come, it’s their choice—
”
“I don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped, dropping
all pretense now. “You’re barely of age, any of you! It’s utter
nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole
Order at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him.
Probably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you
took it to mean that he wanted you — ”
“I didn’t misunderstand,” said Harry flatly. “It’s got to be me.”
He handed her back the single stock he was supposed to be
identifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes.
“And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere United.”
“Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and
rather unnerving return to her casual tone. “I should have realized. Well, Harry, while we’ve still got you here, you won’t mind
helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur’s wedding, will
88
The Ghoul in Pajamas
you? There’s still so much to do.”
“No— I— of course not,” said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of subject.
“Sweet of you,” she replied, and she smiled as she left the
scullery.
From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley keep Harry, Ron, and Hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly
had any time to think. The kindest explanation of this behavior
would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all
from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey.
After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming the garden and helping
Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of however, Harry started
to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out
seems to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another;
he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since
the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing
Ollivander.
“I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting
together and planning, she’ll be able to delay your leaving,” Ginny
told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on
the third night of his stay.
“And then what does she think’s going to happen?” Harry muttered. “Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding
us here making vol-au-vents?”
He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny’s face whiten.
“So it’s true?” She said, “That’s what you’re trying to do?”
“I—not— I was joking,” said Harry evasively.
89
Chapter 6
They stared at each other, and there was something more than
shock in Ginny’s expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that
this was the first time that he had been alone with her since their
stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was
sure she was remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the
door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in.
They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now,
because the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place
as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after the
death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to
whom Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Place’s location had
become a Secret People in turn.
“And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the
power of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities
for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can’t
expect it to hold much longer.”
“But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address
by now?” asked Harry.
“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case
he turns up there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both
to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about
the place, but we can’t be sure. It would have been insane to keep
using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become
so shaky.”
The kitchen was so crowded that evening was difficult to maneuver knives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside
Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made
him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was
90
The Ghoul in Pajamas
trying to hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his
chicken.
“No news about Mad-Eye?” Harry asked Bill.
“Nothing,” replied Bill.
They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because
Bill and Lupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difficult
to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and the
confusion of the battle.
“The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or
about finding the body,” Bill went on. “But that doesn’t mean
much. It’s keeping a lot quiet these days.”
“And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage
magic I used escaping the Death Eaters?” Harry called across the
table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head.
“Because they know I had no choice or because they don’t want
me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me?” “The latter, I think.
Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass breakout.”
“Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, clenching his
knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand
stood out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies.
“Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?”
asked Ron angrily.
“Of course, Ron, but people are terrified.” Mr. Weasley replied,
“terrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the
next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for
one don’t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn’t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrim91
Chapter 6
geour remains shut up in his office all day. I just hope he’s working
on a plan. There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked her
empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart.
“We must decide ’ow you will be disguised,’Arry,” said Fleur,
once everyone had pudding. “For ze wedding,” she added, when he
looked confused. “Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters,
but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after
zey ’ave ’ad champagne.”
From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid.
“Yes, good point,” said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table,
where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning
an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece
of parchment. “Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?”
“Why?” exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring
at his mother. “Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry
and I are both fine with it the way it is!”
“We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’
time, young man— ”
“And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked Ron
furiously. “No! So why in the name of Merlin’s saggy left— ”
“Don’t you talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley
firmly, “And do as you’re told.”
Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and
attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.
“I can help, some of it’s my mess.” Harry told Ron, but Mrs.
Weasley cut across him.
“No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out
the chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change
92
The Ghoul in Pajamas
the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour, you know they’re
arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.”
But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens,
“There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,” Mr. Weasley told
Harry, blocking his access to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me
most of what was left of Sirius’s bike, and, er, I’m hiding— that’s
to say, keeping—it in here. Fantastic stuff! There’s an exhaust
gaskin, as I believe it’s called, the most magnificent battery, and
it’ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I’m going
to try and put it all back together again when Molly’s not— I mean,
when I’ve got time.”
When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere
to be seen, so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom.
“I’m doing it, I’m doing—! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as
Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he
had evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had
been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting
in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet,
sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, into two
enormous piles.
“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.
“And how did you manage to get away?”
“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change
the sheets yesterday,” said Hermione. She threw Numerology and
Grammatica onto one pile and Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto
the other.
“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” Ron told Harry. “I
reckon he might have survived.”
93
Chapter 6
“But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said Harry.
“Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,” said Ron. “How can he
be sure what he saw?”
“Even if the Killing curse missed, Mad Eye still fell about a
thousand feet,” said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of
Britain and Ireland in her hand.
“He could have used a Shield Charm— ”
“Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” said Harry.
“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpily,
punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape.
“Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione,
looking shocked. “It’s dreadful that he’s dead! But we’re being
realistic!”
For the first time, Harry imagined Mad—Eye’s body, broken
as Dumbledore’s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in
its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire
to laugh.
“The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s
why no one’s found him,” said Ron wisely.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone
and buried in Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transfigured
Moody and stuffed him— ”
“Don’t!” squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just
in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman’s
Syllabary.
“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp
bed. “Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset— ”
But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off
94
The Ghoul in Pajamas
the bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished
in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief
that he had used to clean out the over earlier. Hastily pulling out
his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, “Tergeo.”
The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather
pleased with himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione.
“Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I’m sorry. . . .” She blew her nose and
hiccuped. “It’s just so awf-ful, isn’t it? R–right after Dumbledore . . . I j–just n–never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he
seemed so tough!”
“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, giving her a squeeze. “But you know
what he’d say to us if he was here?”
“’C–constant vigilance,’” said Hermione, mopping her eyes.
“That’s right,” said Ron, nodding. “He’d tell us to learn from
what happened to him. And what I’ve learned is not to trust that
cowardly little squit, Mundungus.”
Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up
two more books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back
from around her shoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of
Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining
belt and snapped viciously at Ron’s ankle.
“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the
book from Ron’s leg and retied it shut.
“What are you doing with all those books anyway?” Ron asked,
limping back to his bed.
“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione. “When we’re looking for the Horcruxes.”
95
Chapter 6
“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. “I
forgot we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.”
“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary.
“I wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I
think we’d better take it, to be safe.”
She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and
picked up Hogwarts, A History.
“Listen,” said Harry.
He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with
similar mixtures of resignation and defiance.
“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted
to come with me,” Harry began.
“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.
“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books.
“You know, I think I will take Hogwarts, A History. Even if we’re
not going back there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it
with— ”
“Listen!” said Harry again.
“No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We’re coming with
you. That was decided months ago—years, really.”
“But— ”
“Shut up,” Ron advised him.
“— are you sure you’ve thought this through?” Harry persisted.
“Let’s see,” said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto
the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. “I’ve been packing for
days, so we’re ready to leave at a moment’s notice, which for your
information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not
to mention smuggling Mad-Eye’s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion
96
The Ghoul in Pajamas
right under Ron’s mum’s nose.
“I’ve also modified my parents’ memories so that they’re convinced that they’re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and
that their life’s ambition is to move to Australia, which they have
now done. That’s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track
them down and interrogate them about me— or you, because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a bit about you.
“Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll find Mum
and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don’t—well, I think I’ve
cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell
and Monica Wilkins don’t know that they’ve got a daughter, you
see.”
Hermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back
off the bed, put his arms around her once more, and frowned at
Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not
think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual
for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact.
“I—Hermione, I’m sorry— I didn’t— ”
“Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might
happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what
you’ve done.”
“Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron.
“Go on, he needs to know!”
“Oh, all right. Harry, come here.”
For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door.
“C’mon.”
“Why?” Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the
97
Chapter 6
tiny landing.
“Descendo,” muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling.
A hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to
their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half, moaning sound came out
of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains.
“That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.
“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come and have
a look at him.”
Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic
space. His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught
sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in
the gloom with its large mouth wide open.
“But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?”
“No,” said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or that
number of pustules.”
Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human
in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry’s eyes
became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron’s
pajamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy
and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple
blisters.
“He’s me, see?” said Ron.
“No,” said Harry. “I don’t.”
“I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said
Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to
the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.
“Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here
98
The Ghoul in Pajamas
in my room,” said Ron. “I think he’s really looking forward to it—
well, it’s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool—but
he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he’s going to be me
with spattergroit. Good, eh?”
Harry merely looked his confusion.
“It is!” said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped
the brilliance of the plan. “Look, when we three don’t turn up at
Hogwarts again, everyone’s going to think Hermione and I must be
with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight
for our families to see if they’ve got information on where you are.”
“But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad;
a lot of Muggle—borns are talking about going into hiding at the
moment,” said Hermione.
“We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too fishy and they
can’t all leave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re going to put out the
story that I’m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can’t
go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum
or dad can show then the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules.
Spattergroit’s really contagious, so they’re not going to want to
go near him. It won’t matter that he can’t say anything, either,
because apparently you can’t once the fungus has spread to your
uvula.”
“And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Harry.
“Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul.
Mum . . . well, you’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t accept we’re
going till we’ve gone.”
There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds
as Hermione continued to throw books into one pile or the other.
99
Chapter 6
Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other.
The measures they had taken to protect their families made him
realize, more than anything else could have done, that they really
were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to
him, but he simply could not find words important enough.
Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley
shouting from four floors below.
“Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,”
said Ron. “I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days
before the weddings.”
“Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she’s too young to come on her own,” said Hermione,
as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee.
“Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels,” said
Ron.
“What we really need to decide,” said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and
picking up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, “is where
we’re going after we leave here. I know you said you wanted
to go to Godric’s Hollow first, Harry, and I understand why,
but . . . well . . . shouldn’t we make the Horcruxes our priority?”
“If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d agree with
you,” said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to Godric’s Hollow. His parents graves were only
part of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling
that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because
it was there that he had survived Voldemort’s Killing Curse; now
100
The Ghoul in Pajamas
that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was
drawn to the place where it happened, wanting to understand.
“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping
a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked. “He might expect
you to go back and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to
go wherever you like?”
This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a
counterargument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train
of thought.
“This R.A.B. person,” he said, “You know, the one who stole
the real locket?”
Hermione nodded.
“He said in his note that he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?”
Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake
Horcrux in which R.A.B.’s note was still folded.
“‘I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon
as I can,’” Harry read out.
“Well, what if he did finish it off?” said Ron.
“Or she.” interposed Hermione.
“Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!”
“Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real
locket, aren’t we?” said Hermione, “to find out whether or not it’s
destroyed.”
“And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?”
asked Ron.
“Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.”
“How?” asked Harry. “I didn’t think there were any books on
Horcruxes in the library?”
101
Chapter 6
“There weren’t,” said Hermione, who had turned pink. “Dumbledore removed them all, but he—he didn’t destroy them.”
Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed.
“It—it wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from Harry to
Ron with a kind of desperation. “They were still library books,
even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he
really didn’t want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have
made it much harder to— ”
“Get to the point!” said Ron.
“Well . . . it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I
just did a Summoning Charm. You know—Accio. And . . . they
zoomed out of Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’
dormitory.”
“But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding Hermione
with a mixture of admiration and incredulity.
“Just after his—Dumbledore’s— funeral,” said Hermione in an
even smaller voice. “Right after we agreed we’d leave school and
go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get
my things it—it just occurred to me that the more we knew about
them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I
tried . . . and it worked. They flew straight in through the open
window and I— I packed them.”
She swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to
use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?”
“Can you hear us complaining?” said Ron. “Where are these
books anyway?”
Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from
102
The Ghoul in Pajamas
the pile a large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked
a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something
recently dead.
“This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make
a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art —it’s a horrible book, really
awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it
from the library. . . . If he didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I
bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.”
“Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux,
then, if he’d already read that?” asked Ron.
“He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen
if you split your soul into seven,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was
sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux but the time he
asked Slughorn about them. I think you’re right, Hermione, that
could easily have been where he got the information.”
“And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, “the
more horrible they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually
made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of
your soul by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!”
Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort
moving beyond “usual evil.”
“Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” Ron
asked.
“Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it would be
excruciatingly painful.”
“Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry.
“Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel what
you’ve done. There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can
103
Chapter 6
destroy you. I can’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can
you?”
“No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say
how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”
“Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails. “because it warns Dark wizards how strong
they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve
read, what Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”
“What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.
“Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs,
then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with
them.”
“It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently.
“It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t repair
itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly
rare— ”
“—phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.
“Exactly,” said Hermione, “Our problem is that the are very
few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all
dangerous to carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going
to have to solve though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a
Horcrux won’t do the trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical
repair.”
“But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “Why
can’t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”
“Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.”
Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Her104
The Ghoul in Pajamas
mione hurried on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron,
and ran you through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.”
“Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said Ron.
Harry laughed.
“It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens
to your body, your soul will survive untouched,” said Hermione.
“But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of
soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for
survival, It can’t exist without it.”
“That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the
screams of the piece of Voldemort’s soul as it vanished.
“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul
trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the
diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back
good as new.”
“Hang on,” said Ron, frowning. “The bit of soul in that diary
was possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?”
“While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the
object. I don’t mean holding it for long, it’s nothing to do with
touching it,” she added before Ron could speak. “I mean close
emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made
herself incredibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you get too fond
of or dependent on the Horcrux.”
“I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said Harry.
“Why didn’t I ask him? I never really . . . ”
His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he
105
Chapter 6
should have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster
had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more . . . to
find out everything. . . .
The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a
wall-shaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the
Darkest Art. Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate
Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and
Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was
looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose
face was contorted with rage.
“I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said,
her voice trembling. “I’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there
are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and
I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.”
“Oh yes,” said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt on her
feet, sending books flying in every direction, “we will . . . we’re
sorry . . . ”
With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione, hurried
out of the room after Mrs. Weasley.
“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained Ron in an undertone,
still massaging his head as he and Harry followed. “Except without
the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier
I’ll be.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “then we’ll have nothing to do except find
Horcruxes. . . . It’ll be like a holiday, won’t it?”
Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile
106
The Ghoul in Pajamas
of wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley’s room,
stopped quite abruptly.
The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur’s family by this time, and it was with ill grace that
Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry
attempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed
smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await
the visitors.
Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by
the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes
standing either side of the door in large pots, though there was no
breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect.
The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the
nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up,
although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that
it looked rather forlorn without its usually contingent of capering
gnomes.
He had lost track of how many security enhancements had been
placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all
he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel
by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone
to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were
to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an
unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from
Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with
luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green
107
Chapter 6
robes, who could only be Fleur’s mother.
“Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her.
“Papa!”
Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife;
he was a head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed
black beard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing toward
Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each
cheek, leaving her flustered.
“You ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur
tells us you ’ave been working very ’ard.”
“Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No
trouble at all.”
Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was
peering out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes.
“Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs.
Weasley’s hand between his two plump ones and beaming. “We
are most honored at the approaching union of our two families! Let
me present my wife, Apolline.”
Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs.
Weasley too. she said. “Your ’usband ’as been telling
us such amusing stories!”
Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him
a look, upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an
expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend.
“And, of course, you ’ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!”
said Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven
years old, with waist—length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave
Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry
108
The Ghoul in Pajamas
a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat
loudly.
“Well, come in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, with many “No, please!”s and
“After you!”s and “Not at all!”s.
The Delacours, as it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant
guests. They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with
the preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced
everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids’ shows “Charmant!” Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household
spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she could
and jabbering away in rapid French.
On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so
many people. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour’s
protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy’s old room, and Bill would be sharing with
Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent,
and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took to
volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded
house.
“But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance
of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.
“Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she approached them. “We’d better shut them away again before the
109
Chapter 6
men arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the wedding,”
she explained, pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked
exhausted. “Millamant’s Magic Marquees . . . they’re very good.
Bill’s escorting them. . . . You’d better stay inside while they’re here,
Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having
all these security spells around the place.”
“I’m sorry,” said Harry humbly.
“Oh, don’t be silly, dear!” said Mrs. Weasley at once. “I didn’t
mean—well, your safety’s much more important! Actually, I’ve
been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday,
Harry. Seventeen, after all, it’s an important day. . . .”
“I don’t want a fuss,” said Harry quickly, envisaging the addition strain this would put on them all. “Really, Mrs. Weasley,
just a normal dinner would be fine. . . . It’s the day before the wedding. . . .”
“Oh, well, if you’re sure, dear. I’ll invite Remus and Tonks,
shall I? And how about Hagrid?”
“That’d be great,” said Harry. “But please don’t go to loads of
trouble.”
“Not at all, not at all . . . It’s no trouble. . . .” She looked at
him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened
up, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near
the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang
themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for
the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her.

Chapter 7
The Will of Albus
Dumbledore
H
e was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue
light of dawn. Far below, swathed in mist, was the
shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down
there, the man he needed so badly he could think
of little else, the man who held the answer, the answer to his
problem . . . ?
“Oi, wake up,”
Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in
Ron’s dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room
was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his
tiny wing. The scar on Harry’s forehead was prickling.
“You were muttering in your sleep.”
“Was I?”
“Yeah. ‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’”
Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron’s face appeared slightly
111
Chapter 7
blurred.
“Who’s Gregorovitch?”
“I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.”
Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he
had heard the name before, but he could not think where.
“I think Voldemort’s looking for him.”
“Poor bloke,” said Ron fervently.
Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried
to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that
came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little
village cradled in a deep valley.
“I think he’s abroad.”
“Who, Gregorovitch?”
“Voldemort. I think he’s somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn’t look like anywhere in Britain.”
“You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?”
Ron sounded worried.
“Do me a favor and don’t tell Hermione,” said Harry. “Although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep . . . ”
He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon’s cage, thinking . . . Why was
the name “Gregorovitch” familiar?
“I think,” he said slowly, “he’s got something to do with Quidditch. There’s some connection, but I can’t— I can’t think what it
is.”
“Quidditch?” said Ron. “Sure you’re not thinking of Gorgovitch?”
“Who?”
“Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle
112
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
drops in a season.”
“No,” said Harry, “I’m definitely not think of Gorgovitch.”
“I try not to either,” said Ron. “Well, happy birthday anyway.”
“Wow— that’s right, I forgot! I’m seventeen.”
Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at
the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses, and said “Accio
Glasses!” Although they were only around a foot away, there was
something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward
him, or at least until they poked him in the eye.
“Slick,” snorted Ron.
Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron’s possessions flying around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up
flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces
of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to
untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange
robes on Ron’s Chudley Cannons posters right blue.
“I’d do your fly by hand, though,” Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry immediately checked it. “Here’s your present.
Unwrap it up here, it’s not for my mother’s eyes.”
“A book?” said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. “Bit
of a departure from tradition, isn’t it?”
“This isn’t your average book,” said Ron. “It’s pure gold:
Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything
you need to know about girls. If only I’d had this last year I’d
have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I wouldn’t
have known how to get going with . . . Well, Fred and George gave
me a copy, and I’ve learned a lot. You’d be surprised, it’s not all
about wandwork, either.”
When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents
113
Chapter 7
waiting on the table. Bill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing
their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them over
the frying pan.
“Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,” said
Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. “He had to leave early for work,
but he’ll be back for dinner. That’s our present on top.”
Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and
unwrapped it. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars
circling around the face instead of hands.
“It’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age.”
said Mrs. Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the corner.
“I’m afraid that one isn’t new like Ron’s, it was actually my brother
Fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his possessions, it’s a
bit dented on the back, but— ”
The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged
her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps
she understood them, because she patted his check clumsily when
he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way,
causing half a pack of bacon out of the frying pan onto the floor.
“Happy birthday, Harry!” said Hermione, hurrying into the
kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile. “It’s
not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?” she
added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her.”
“Come on, then, open Hermione’s!” said Ron.
She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages
contained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur. (“Ah yes, zis will
give you ze smoothest shave you will eve ’ave,” Monsieur Delacour
assured him, “but you must tell it clearly what you want . . . ozzer114
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
wise you might find you ’ave a leetle less hair zan you would
like. . . .”), chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box
of the latest Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred
and George.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the
arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen
uncomfortably crowded.
“I’ll pack these for you,” Hermione said brightly, taking Harry’s
presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs.
“I’m nearly done, I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants
to come out of the wash, Ron— ”
Ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the
first-floor landing.
“Harry, will you come in here a moment?”
It was Ginny, Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took
him by the elbow rugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous,
Harry followed Ginny into her room.
He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright.
There was a large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters
on one wall and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch
Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood
facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where
he and Ginny had once played two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and
Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee.
The golden flag on top was level with Ginny’s window.
Ginny looked up into Harry’s face, took a deep breath, and said,
“Happy seventeenth.”
“Yeah . . . thanks.”
She was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it difficult
115
Chapter 7
to look back at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.
“Nice view,” he said feebly, pointing toward the window.
She ignored this. He could not blame her,
“I couldn’t think what to get you,” she said.
“You didn’t have to get me anything.” She disregarded this
too.
“I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because
you wouldn’t be able to take it with you.”
He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was
one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely
weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brother must
have toughened her up.
She took a step closer to him.
“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember
me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing
whatever you’re doing.”
“I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the
ground, to be honest.”
“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she whispered,
and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before,
and Harry was kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion better
than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny,
the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweetsmelling hair—
The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart.
“Oh,” said Ron pointedly. “Sorry.”
“Ron!” Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of breath.
There was a strained silence, then Ginny said in a flat little voice,
“Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.”
116
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
Ron’s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry
wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a
cold drain had entered the room when the door appeared, and his
shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons
for ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from
her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy
forgetfulness was gone.
He looked at Ginny wanting to say something, though he hardly
knew what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that
she might have succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do
anything to comfort her in front of Ron.
“I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of
the bedroom.
Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and
into the yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione
trotting along behind them looking scared.
Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mow lawn, Ron
rounded on Harry.
“You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her
around?”
“I’m not messing her around,” said Harry, as Hermione caught
up with them.
“Ron— ”
But Ron held up a hand to silence her.
“She was really cut up when you ended it— ”
“So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t because I
wanted to.”
“Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get
her hopes up again— ”
117
Chapter 7
“She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us to— to end up married, or— ”
“As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry’s mind of Ginny
in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger.
In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was
free and unencumbered, whereas his . . . he could see nothing but
Voldemort ahead.
“If you keep groping her every chance you get— ”
“It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day was
cloudless, but he felt as though the sun had gone in. “Okay?”
Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward
and forward on his feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well,
that’s . . . yeah.”
Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for
the rest of the day, nor by any look or gesture did she show that
they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie’s arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided
a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair,
raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to
get a proper haircut.
As Harry’s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow’s
kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin,
Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in the
garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns,
all emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the
guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s ministrations, George’s wound
was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole
in the side of his head, despite the twins’ many jokes about it.
Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end
118
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and
bushes.
“Nice,” said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. “You’ve
really got an eye for that sort of thing.”
“Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, looking both pleased and a
little confused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a
funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he
found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe ways to Charm
Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation
with Monsieur Delacour.
“Out of the way, out of the way!” sang Mrs. Weasley, coming
through the gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ballsized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized
that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending
with her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground.
When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry
said,
“That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.”
“Oh, it’s nothing, dear.” she said fondly. Over her shoulder,
Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one.
By seven o’clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by
Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane.
Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible,
hairy brow suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry’s hand,
Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd;
Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant.
“Happy birthday, Harry,” she said, hugging him tightly.
119
Chapter 7
“Seventeen, eh!” said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized
glass of wine from Fred. “Six years ter the day we met, Harry,
d’yeh remember it?”
“Vaguely,” said Harry, grinning up at him. “Didn’t you smash
down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a
wizard?’
“I forge’ the details,” Hagrid Chortled. “All righ’, Ron, Hermione?”
“We’re fine,” said Hermione. “How are you?”
“Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I’ll
show yeh when yeh get back— ” Harry avoided Ron’s and Hermione’s gazes and Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. “Here, Harry—
couldn’ think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” He
pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long
string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. “Mokeskin.
Hide anythin’ in there an’ no one but the owner can get it out.
They’re rare, them.”
“Hagrid, thanks!”
“S’nothin’,” said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand,
“An’ there’s Charlie! Always liked him—hey! Charlie!”
Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his
new, brutally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset,
with a number of burns and scratches up his muscly arms.
“Hi, Hagrid, how’s it going?”
“Bin meanin’ ter write fer ages. How’s Norbert doin’”
“Norbert?” Charlie laughed. “The Norwegian Ridgeback? We
call her Norberta now.”
“Wha—Norbert’s a girl?”
“Oh yeah,” said Charlie.
120
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
“How can you tell?” asked Hermione
“They’re a lot more vicious.” said Charlie. He looked over his
shoulder and dropped his voice. “Wish Dad would hurry up and
get here. Mum’s getting edgy.”
They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk
to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate.
“I think we’d better start without Arthur,” she called to the
garden at large after a moment or two. “He must have been held
up at— oh!”
They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came
flying across the yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself
into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke
with Mr. Weasley’s voice.
“Minister of Magic coming with me.”
The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur’s family
peering in astonishment where it had vanished.
“We shouldn’t be here,” said Lupin at once. “Harry— I’m
sorry— I’ll explain another time— ”
He seized Tonks’s wrist and pulled her away; the reached the
fence, climbed over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley
looked bewildered.
“The Minister—but why—? I don’t understand— ”
But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr.
Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by
Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled
hair.
The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden
and the lantern-lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching
them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern
121
Chapter 7
light, Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they
had met, scraggy and grim.
“Sorry to intrude,” said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt
before the table. “Especially as I can see that I am gate crashing
a party.”
His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake.
“Many happy returns.”
“Thanks,” said Harry.
“I require a private word with you,” Scrimgeour went on. “Also
with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.”
“Us?” said Ron, sounding surprised, “Why us?”
“I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,”
said Scrimgeour. “Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr.
Weasley.
“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The,
er, sitting room, why don’t you use that?”
“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will
be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.”
Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs.
Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the
way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two
were thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow,
have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of
Hogwarts.
Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy
kitchen and into the Burrow’s sitting room. Although the garden
had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in
here. Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they
illuminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in
122
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving
Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa.
Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke,
“I have some questions for the three of your and I think it will
be best if we do it individually. If you two“—he pointed at Harry
and Hermione— ” can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.”
“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. “You can speak to us together, or not at all.”
Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had
the impression that the minister was wondering it was worthwhile
opening hostilities this early.
“Very well then, together,” he said, shrugging. He cleared his
throat. “I am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore’s will.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another.
“A surprise, apparently? You were not aware the that Dumbledore had left you anything?”
“A— all of us?” said Ron. “Me and Hermione too?”
“Yes, all of— ”
But Harry interrupted.
“Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this
long to give us what he left us?”
“Isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could
answer. “They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. You had
no right to do that!” she said, and her voice trembled slightly.
“I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively. “The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to
confiscate the contents of a will— ”
“That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark ar123
Chapter 7
tifacts,” said Hermione, “and the Ministry is supposed to have
evidence that the deceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing
them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying
to pass us something cursed?”
“Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss
Granger?” asked Scrimgeour.
“No, I’m not,” retorted Hermione. “I’m hoping to do some
good in the world!”
Ron laughed, Scrimgeour’s eyes flickered toward him and away
again as Harry spoke.
“So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can’t
you think of a pretext to keep them?”
“No, it’ll be because the thirty-one days are up,” said Hermione
at once. “They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they
can prove they’re dangerous. Right?”
“Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?” asked
Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled.
“Me? No—not really . . . It was always Harry who . . . ”
Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione to see Hermione
giving him a stop— talking—now! sort of look, but the damage
was done: Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what
he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of
prey upon Ron’s answer.
“If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He
made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of
his possessions—his private library, his magical instruments, and
other personal effects—were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think
you were singled out?”
124
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
“I . . . dunno,” said Ron, “I . . . when I say we weren’t close . . . I
mean, I think he liked me. . . .”
“You’re being modest, Ron,” said Hermione. “Dumbledore was
very fond of you.”
This was stretching the truth to breaking points as far as Harry
knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and
direct contact between them had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak
and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid
had given Harry. From it, he removed a scroll of parchment which
he unrolled and read aloud.
“‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore’ . . . Yes, here we are. . . .’To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I
leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when
he uses it.’”
Scrimgeour took something from the bag an object that Harry
had seen before. It looked something like a silver cigarette lighter,
but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and
restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and
passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in
his fingers, looking stunned.
“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It
may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design.
Why would he have left you an item so rare?”
Ron shook his head, looking bewildered.
“Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,” Scrimgeour persevered. “Yet the only one he remembered in his will are
you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put
his Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?”
125
Chapter 7
“Put out lights, I s’pose,” mumbled Ron. “What else could I
do with it?”
Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at
Ron for a moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore’s will.
“‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The
Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.’”
Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked
as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Arts upstairs. Its
binding was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it from
Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed
at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned
to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed
symbols.
“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss
Granger?” asked Scrimgeour
“He . . . he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice,
mopping her eyes with her sleeve.
“But why that particular book?”
“I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it.”
“Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret
messages, with Dumbledore?”
“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve.
“And if the Ministry still hasn’t found any hidden codes in this
book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will.”
She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly
that Ron had difficultly extracting his arm to put it around Hermione’s shoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will.
“‘To Harry James Potter,’” he read, and Harry’s insides con126
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
tracted with a sudden excitement, “‘I leave the Snitch he caught in
his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards
of perseverance and skill.’”
As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball,
its silver wings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help
feeling definite sense of anticlimax.
“Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked Scrimgeour.
“No idea,” said Harry. “For the reasons you just read out, I
suppose . . . to remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere
and whatever it was.”
“You think this is a mere symbolic keepsake, then?”
“I suppose so,” said Harry. “What else could it be?”
“I’m asking the questions,” said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair
a little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now;
the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the
hedge.
“I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,”
Scrimgeour said to Harry. “Why is that?”
Hermione laughed derisively.
“Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact that Harry’s a great
Seeker, that’s way too obvious,” she said. “There must be a secret
message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!”
“I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrimgeour, “but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small
object. You know why, I’m sure?”
Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought
that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained
habit she could not suppress the urge.
127
Chapter 7
“Because Snitches have flesh memories,” she said.
“What?” said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione’s Quidditch knowledge negligible.
“Correct,” said Scrimgeour. “A Snitch is not touched by bare
skin before it is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves.
It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in the case of disputed capture. This
Snitch”—he held up the tiny golden ball— “will remember your
touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted
this Snitch so that it will open only for you.”
Harry’s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his
bare hand in front of the Minister?
“You don’t say anything,” said Scrimgeour. “Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?”
“No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch
the Snitch without really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione’s mind; he could practically
hear her brain whirring beside him.
“Take it,” said Scrimgeour quietly.
Harry met the minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option
but to obey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward
again and placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry’s
palm. Nothing happened. As Harry’s fingers closed around the
Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron,
and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way.
“That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Her128
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
mione laughed.
“That’s all, then, is it?” asked Hermione, making to prise herself off the sofa.
“Not quite,” said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now,
“Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.”
“What is it?” asked Harry, excitement rekindling.
Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time.
“The sword of Godric Gryffindor,” he said.
Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a
sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the
sword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too
small to contain it.
“So where is it?” Harry asked suspiciously.
“Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was not Dumbledore’s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs— ”
“It belongs to Harry!” said Hermione hotly. “It chose him, he
was the one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat— ”
“According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present
itself to any worthy Gryffindor,” said Scrimgeour. “That does not
make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven
cheek, scrutinizing Harry. “Why do you think—?”
“—Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?” said Harry,
struggling to keep his temper. “Maybe he thought it would look
nice on my wall.”
“This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour. “Was
it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric
Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give
129
Chapter 7
you that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you
are the one destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”
“Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some
people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So this is what
you’ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break
open a Snitch? People are dying— I was nearly one of them—
Voldemort chased me across three countries, he killed Mad-Eye
Moody, but there’s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!”
“You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry
jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and
jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand: It singed
a hole in Harry’s T-shirt like a lit cigarette.
“Oi!” said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but
Harry said,
“No! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?”
“Remembered you’re not at school, have you?” said Scrimgeour, breathing hard into Harry’s face. “Remembered that I am
not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination?
You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a
seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It’s time you
learned some respect!”
“It’s time you earned it.” said Harry.
The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps,
then the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley ran in.
“We—we thought we heard— ” began Mr. Weasley, looking
130
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually
nose to nose.
“— raised voices,” panted Mrs. Weasley.
Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at
the hole he had made in Harry’s T-shirt. He seemed to regret his
loss of temper.
“It—it was nothing,” he growled. “I . . . regret your attitude,”
he said, looking Harry full in the face once more. “You seem to
think that the Ministry does not desire what you—what Dumbledore—desired. We ought to be working together.”
“I don’t like your methods, Minister,” said Harry. “Remember?”
For the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to
Scrimgeour the scars that still showed white on the back of it,
spelling I must not tell lies. Scrimgeour’s expression hardened.
He turned away without another word and limped from the room.
Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back
door. After a minute or so she called, “He’s gone!”
“What did he want?” Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at
Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back
to them.
“To give us what Dumbledore left us,” said Harry. “They’ve
only just released the contents of his will.”
Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects
Scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle
the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to
pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as
to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr.
131
Chapter 7
Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time,
Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, “Harry, dear, everyone’s awfully
hungry, we didn’t like to start without you. . . . Shall I serve dinner
now?”
They all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of
“Happy Birthday” and much gulping of cake, the party broke up.
Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was
far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a
tent for himself in a neighboring field.
“Meet us upstairs,” Harry whispered to Hermione, while they
helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. “After
everyone’s gone to bed.”
Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry
filled Hagrid’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items
he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were:
the Marauder’s Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and
R.A.B.’s locket. He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse
around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its
wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and
tiptoed inside.
“Muffliato,” she whispered, waving her hand in the direction of
the stairs.
“Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron.
“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Deluminator.”
Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked
it. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.
“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we
could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
132
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew
back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what
they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!”
“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will
just to help us turn out the lights!”
“D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will
and examine everything he’d left us?” asked Harry.
“Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why
he was leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . . ”
“ . . . why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?”
asked Ron.
“Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through the The
Tales of Beedle the Bard. “If these things are important enough
to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d
have let us know why . . . unless he thought it was obvious?”
“Thought wrong, then, didn’t he?” said Ron. “I always said he
was mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry
an old Snitch—what the hell was that about?”
“I’ve no idea,” said Hermione. “When Scrimgeour made you
take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!”
“Yeah, well,” said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the
Snitch in his fingers. “I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of
Scrimgeour, was I?”
“What do you mean?” asked Hermione.
“The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?” said
Harry. “Don’t you remember?”
Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped,
pointing frantically from Harry to the Snitch and back again until
133
Chapter 7
he found his voice.
“That was the one you nearly swallowed!”
“Exactly,” said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he
pressed his mouth to the Snitch.
It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled
up inside him: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione
cried out.
“Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look!”
He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words
written in the thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as
Dumbledore’s:
I open at the close.
He had barely read them when the words vanished again.
“‘I open at the close . . . ’ What’s that supposed to mean?”
Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking back.
“I open at the close . . . at the close . . . I open at the close . . . ”
But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many
different inflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning
from them.
“And the sword,” said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch’s inscription.
“Why did he want Harry to have the sword?”
“And why couldn’t he just have told me?” Harry said quietly.
“I was there it was right there on the wall of his office during all
our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just
give it to me then?
134
The Will of Albus Dumbledore
He felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a
question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his
brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed
in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know
what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand?
“And as for this book” said Hermione, “The Tales of Beedle the
Bard . . . I’ve never even heard of them.”
“You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” said
Ron incredulously. “You’re kidding, right?”
“No, I’m not.” said Hermione in surprise. “Do you know them,
then?”
“Well, of course I do!”
Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having
read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise.
“Oh come on! All the old kids’ stories are supposed to be Beedle’s, aren’t they? ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’ . . . ‘The Wizard and the Hopping Pot’ . . . ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling
Stump’ . . . ”
“Excuse me?” said Hermione, giggling. “What was that last
one?”
“Come off it!” said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to
Hermione. “You must’ve heard of Bubbitty Rabbitty— ”
“Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!” said Hermione. “We didn’t hear stories like that when
we were little, we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and
‘Cinderella’— ”
“What’s that, an illness?” asked Ron.
“So these are children’s stories?” asked Hermione, bending
135
Chapter 7
again over the runes.
“Yeah,” said Ron uncertainly, “I mean, that’s just what you
hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I
dunno what they’re like in the original versions.
“But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?”
Something creaked downstairs.
“Probably just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair,” said Ron nervously.
“All the same, we should get to bed,” whispered Hermione. “It
wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow.’
“No,” agreed Ron. “A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s
mother might put a bit of a damper of the wedding. I’ll get the
lights.”
And he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the
room.
136
Chapter 8
The Wedding
T
hree o’clock on the following afternoon found Harry,
Ron, Fred, and George standing outside the great white
marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice
Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from
the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen
hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry
as “Cousin Barny” and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him.
All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could
help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters
had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden jacketed band,
and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance
away under a tree. Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke
issuing from the spot.
Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and
rows of fragile golden hairs set on either side of a long purple carpet.
The supporting poles are entwined with white and gold flow137
Chapter 8
ers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden
balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly
become husband and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was
slightly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in
the full glare of a summer’s day.
“When I get married,” said Fred, tugging at the collar of his
own robes, “I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You
can all wear what you like, and I’ll put a full Body Bind Curse on
Mum until it’s all over.”
“She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,” said George.
“Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh
blimey, brace yourselves—here they come, look.”
Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one, out of
nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes
a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through
the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched
birds fluttered on the witches’ hats, while precious gems glittered
from man of the wizards’ cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew
louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd
approached the tent.
“Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,” said George, craning his neck for a better look. “They’ll need help understanding
our English customs, I’ll look after them. . . .”
“Not so fast, Your Holeyness,” said Fred, and darting past
the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the procession, he said,
“Here—permettez-moi to assiter vous,” to a pair of pretty French
girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George
was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge
138
The Wedding
of Mr. Weasley’s old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather
deaf old couple fell to Harry’s lot.
“Wotcher,” said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee
again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She
had turned blonde for the occasion. “Arthur told us you were the
one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,” she added in a
whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. “The Ministry’s being very
anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might
not do you any favors.”
“It’s fine, I understand.” said Harry, speaking more to Lupin
than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned
away, Harry saw Lupin’s face fall again into lines of misery. He
did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having
misunderstood Fred’s directions he had sat himself, not upon the
magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back
row, but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden
matchsticks.
While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted
apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the
entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking
wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the
texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front
of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow.
An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden
chain around his neck.
“Xenophilius Lovegood,” he said, extending a hand to Harry,
“my daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good
Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?” he added
to Ron.
139
Chapter 8
“Yes,” said Ron. “Isn’t she with you?”
“She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the
gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just
how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes— or, to give
them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.”
“Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,” said Ron, “but
I think Fred and George taught them those.”
He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up.
“Hello, Harry!” she said.
“Er—my name’s Barny,” said Harry, flummoxed.
“Oh, have you changed that too?” she asked brightly.
“How did you know—?”
“Oh, just your expression,” she said.
Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she
had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you got
over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant.
At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears.
Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Bidding
the wizards farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her
finger and said, “Daddy, look— one of the gnomes actually bit me!”
“How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!” said
Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna’s outstretched finger and examining
the bleeding puncture marks. “Luna, my love, if you should feel
any burgeoning talent today—perhaps an unexpected urge to sing
opera or to declaim in Mermish—do not repress it! You may have
been gifted by the Gernumblies!”
Ron, passing them in the opposite direction, let out a loud snort.
“Ron can laugh,” said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, “bu my father has done a lot of research
140
The Wedding
on Gernumbli magic.”
“Really?” said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views. “Are you sure you don’t
want to put anything on that bite, though?”
“Oh, it’s fine,” said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion
and looking Harry up and down. “You look smart. I told Daddy
most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you
ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.”
As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an
elderly witch clutching her arm. Her beaky nose, red-trimmed
eyes, and feathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered
flamingo.
“ . . . and you hair’s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I
thought you were Ginevra. Merlin’s beard, what is Xenophilius
Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?”
she barked at Harry.
“Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.”
“Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn’t Harry Potter
here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of
yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?”
“No—he couldn’t come— ”
“Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks
in press photographs, then. I’ve just been instructing the bride
on how best to wear my tiara.” she shouted at Harry. “Goblinmade, you know, and been in my family for centuries. She’s a
good-looking girl, but still—French. Well, well, find me a good
seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on
my feet too long.”
Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not
reappear for some time. When next they met at the entrance,
141
Chapter 8
Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The marquee
was nearly full now, and for the first time there was no queue
outside.
“Nightmare, Muriel is,” said Ron, mopping his forehead on his
sleeve. “She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank
God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb
under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she’ll have written
them out of her will—like they care, they’re going to end up richer
than anyone in the family, rate they’re going. . . . Wow,” he added,
blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them.
“You look great!”
“Always the tone of surprise,” said Hermione, though she
smiled. She was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. “Your Great—Aunt
Muriel doesn’t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving
Fleur the tiara. She says, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?’ and
then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles.’”
“Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,” said Ron.
“Talking about Muriel?” inquired George, reemerging from the
marquee with Fred. “Yeah, she’ just told me my ears are lopsided.
Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was
a right laugh at weddings.”
“Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours
later?” asked Hermione.
“Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,” conceded
George.
“But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party.”
said Fred. “He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run
onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches
of flowers out of his— ”
142
The Wedding
“Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said Hermione, while Harry
roared with laughter.
“Never married, for some reason,” said Ron.
“You amaze me,” said Hermione.
They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the
latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and
thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and
said, with his eyes on Hermione, “You look vunderful.”
“Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag,
which made a loud thump quite disproportionate with its size. As
she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said, “I didn’t know you
were— goodness—it’s lovely to see—how are you again?”
Ron’s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at
Krum’s invitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said,
much too loudly, “How come you’re here?”
“Fleur invited me,” said Krum, eyebrows raised.
Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then,
feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron’s vicinity, offered to show him his seat.
“You friend is not pleased to see me,” said Krum as he entered
the now packed marquee. “Or is he a relative?” he added with a
glance at Harry’s red curly hair.
“Cousin,” Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening.
His appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela
cousins: He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people
were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle.
“Time to sit down,” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to get run
over by the bride.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the second row
143
Chapter 8
behind Fred and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s
ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to Harry,
“Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?”
Harry gave a noncommittal grunt.
A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the
general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter.
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at
relatives: Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethystcolored robes with a matching hat.
A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the
marquee, both wearing dress robes, with large white roses in their
buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music
swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons.
“Ooooh!” said Hermione, swivelling around in her seat to look
at the entrance.
A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and
wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle,
Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur
was wearing a very simple white dresses and seemed to be emitting
a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone
else by comparison, today it beautified everyone it fell upon. Ginny
and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier
than usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did not look as
though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with
a slight shock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who
had presided at Dumbledore’s funeral, now standing in front of bill
and Fleur. “We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of
two faithful souls . . . ”
144
The Wedding
“Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,” said auntie
Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. “But I must say, Ginevra’s
dress is far too low cut.”
Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly
faced the front again. Harry’s mind wandered a long way from the
marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts
of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always
seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining
hours from a normal person’s life, a person without a lightningshaped scar on his forehead. . . .
“Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle. . . . ?”
In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were
both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from
the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out
one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned
and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears.
“ . . . then I declare you bonded for life.”
The tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of
Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling
around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round
of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst: Birds of paradise
and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their
songs and chimes to the din.
“Ladies and gentlemen!” called the tuft-haired wizard. “If you
would please stand up!”
They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his
wand again. The seats on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so
that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with
a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside.
145
Chapter 8
Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to
form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs groped themselves
around small white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back
to earth around it, and the golden-jacketed hand trooped toward
a podium.
“Smooth,” said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on
all sides, some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer,
and firewhisky, other tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches.
“We should go and congratulate them!” said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where bill and Fleur had vanished
amid a crowd of well-wishers.
“We’ll have time later,” shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. “Hermione,
cop hold, let’s grab a table. . . . Not there! Nowhere near Muriel— ”
Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and
right as he went: Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out
for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the
Marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the
one where Luna sat alone.
“All right if we join you?” asked Ron.
“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Daddy’s just gone to give Bill and
Fleur our present.”
“What is it, a lifetime’s supply of Gurdyroots?” asked Ron.
Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry
instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation
for a few moments.
The band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance
floor first, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led
Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and
Fleur’s father.
146
The Wedding
“I like this song,” said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike
tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the
dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed
and waving her arms.
“She’s great, isn’t she?” said Ron admiringly. “Always good
value.”
But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had
dropped into Luna’s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably
flustered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her.
With a scowl on his face he said, “Who is that man in the yellow?”
“That’s Xenophilius Lovegood, he’s the father of a friend of
ours,” said Ron. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were
not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation.
“Come and dance,” he added abruptly to Hermione.
She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They
vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor.
“Ah, they are together now?” asked Krum, momentarily distracted.
“Er— sort of,” said Harry.
“Who are you?” Krum asked.
“Barny Weasley.”
They shook hands.
“You, Barny—you know this man Lovegood vell?”
“No, I only met him today. Why?”
Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius,
who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance
floor.
“Because,” said Krum, “if he was not a guest of Fleur’s, I would
duel him here and now, for vearing that filthy sign upon his chest.”
“Sign?” said Harry, looking at Xenophilius too. The strange
147
Chapter 8
triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. “Why? What’s wrong
with it?”
“Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald’s sign.”
“Grindelwald . . . the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?”
“Exactly.”
Krum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he says,
“Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of
course, he vos never poverful in this country, they said he feared
Dumbledore— and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this”—
he pointed a finger a Xenophilius— “this is his symbol, recognized
it at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ver he
vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it into their books and clothes,
thinking to shock, make themselves impressive—until those of us
who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.”
Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that
Luna’s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in
the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape.
“Are you—er—quite sure it’s Grindelwald’s—?”
“I am not mistaken,” said Krum coldly. “I valked past that sign
for several years, I know it vell.”
“Well, there’s a chance,” said Harry, “that Xenophilius doesn’t
actually know what the symbol means. The Lovegoods are
quite . . . unusual. He could easily have picked it up somewhere
and think it’s a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned
Snorkack or something.”
“The cross section of a vot?”
“Well, I don’t know what they are, but apparently he and his
daughter go on holiday looking for them. . . .”
Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her
148
The Wedding
father.
“That’s her,” he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing
alone, waving her arms around her head like someone attempting
to beat off midges.
“Vy is she doing that?” asked Krum.
“Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,” said Harry, who
recognized the symptoms.
Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making
fun of him. He drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it
menacingly on his thigh; sparks flew out of the end.
“Gregorovitch!” said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but
Harry was too excited to care; the memory came back to him at
the sight of Krum’s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it
carefully before the Triwizard Tournament.
“Vot about him?” asked Krum suspiciously.
“He’s a wandmaker!”
“I know that,” said Krum.
“He made your wand! That’s why I thought—Quidditch— ”
Krum was looking more and more suspicious.
“How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?”
“I . . . I read it somewhere, I think,” said Harry. “In a— a fan
magazine,” he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified.
“I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,” he said.
“So . . . er . . . where is Gregorovitch these days?”
Krum looked puzzled.
“He retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase
a Gregorovitch vand. They are the best— although I know, of
course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander.”
Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like
Krum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a
149
Chapter 8
celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a
reason: It was surely because of what Harry’s wand had done on the
night that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. The holly
and phoenix feather had conquered the borrowed wand, something
that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorovitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than Ollivander,
did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not?
“This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling Harry to
his surroundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined
Luna. “She is also a relative of yours?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, suddenly irritated, “and she’s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn’t want to cross him.”
Krum grunted.
“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again,
“is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the
good-looking girls are taken?”
And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a
passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded
dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch,
but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor.
Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched
Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George’s friend Lee
Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given
Ron.
He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge
how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he
was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake
topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake
was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through
the crowd. As the evening drew in, and moths began to swoop
150
The Wedding
under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry
became more and more uncontained. Freda and George had long
since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur’s cousins;
Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were
singing ‘Odo the Hero” in a corner.
Wandering through the crowd so as not to escape a drunken
uncle of Ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his
son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud
of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock as
was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking
his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, the
member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore’
obituary.
Harry approached him.
“May I sit down?”
“Of course, of course,” said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched,
wheezy voice.
Harry leaned in.
“Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter.”
Doge gasped.
“My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. . . . I
am so glad, so honored!”
In a flutter a nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of
champagne.
“I’ve thought of writing to you,” he whispered, “after Dumbledore . . . the shock . . . and for you, I am sure . . . ”
Doge’s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears.
“I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,” said
Harry. “I didn’t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.”
“As well as anyone,” said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin.
151
Chapter 8
“Certainly I knew him longest, if you don’t count Aberforth— and
somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.”
“Speaking of the Daily Prophet . . . I don’t know whether you
saw, Mr. Doge—?”
“Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.”
“Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview Rita
Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?”
Doge’s face flooded with angry color.
“Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a
more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her. I am
ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering
trout, which resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast upon
my sanity.”
“Well, in that interview.” Harry went on, “Rita Skeeter hinted
that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he
was young.”
“Don’t believe a word of it!” said Dodge at once. “Not a word,
Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!
Harry looked into Doge’s earnest, pained face and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that
Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn’t Doge understand
Harry’s need to be sure, to know everything?
Perhaps Doge suspected Harry’s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, “Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful— ”
But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.
“Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!”
Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there,
the plumes dancing on her hat, a goblet of champagne in her hand.
“She’s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!”
“Hello, Muriel,” said Doge. “Yes, we were just discussing— ”
152
The Wedding
“You there! Give me your chair, I’m a hundred a seven!”
Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel swung around it with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and
Harry.
“Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,” she said to
Harry. “Now, what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias?
You know, she’s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can’t wait
to read it, I must remember to place an order at Flourish and
Blotts!”
Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained
her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a
replacement. She took another large gulp of champagne, belched,
and then said, “There’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs!
Before he came so respected and respectable and all that tosh,
there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!”
“Ill—informed sniping,” said Doge, turning radish-colored
again.
“You would say that, Elphias,” cackled Auntie Muriel. “I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of
yours!”
“I’m sorry you think so,” said Doge, more coldly still. “I assure
you I was writing from the heart.”
“Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you’ll
still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away
with his Squib sister!”
“Muriel!” exclaimed Doge.
A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was
stealing through Harry’s chest.
“What do you mean?” he asked Muriel. “Who said his sister
153
Chapter 8
was a Squib? I thought she was ill?”
“Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry!” said Auntie Muriel,
looking delighted at the effect she had produced. “Anyway, how
could you expect to know anything about it! It all happened years
and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth
is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really
happened. That’s why I can’t wait to find out what Skeeter’s
unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long
time!”
“Untrue!” wheezed Doge, “Absolutely untrue!”
“He never told me his sister was a Squib,” said Harry, without
thinking, still cold inside.
“And why on earth would he tell you?” screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry.
“The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,” began Elphias
in a voice stiff with emotion, “is, I should have thought, quite clear.
He was so devastated by her death— “
“Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?” squawked Muriel,
“Why did half of us never even know she existed, until they carried
the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where was
saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being
brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his
own house!”
“What d’you mean, locked in the cellar?” asked Harry. “What
is this?”
Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry.
“Dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise— “
“She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine
154
The Wedding
woman,” whispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored
him.
“—proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would
have been mortified to produce a Squib— “
“Ariana was not a Squib!” wheezed Doge.
“So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended
Hogwarts!” said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. “In our
day, Squibs were often hushed up, thought to take it to the extreme
of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she
didn’t exist— –“
“I tell you, that’s not what happened!” said Doge, but Auntie
Muriel steamrollered on, still addressing Harry.
Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community . . . much kinder than
trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they
must always be second class, but naturally Kendra Dumbledore
wouldn’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle
school— –“
“Ariana was delicate!” said Doge desperately. “Her health was
always too poor to permit her— “
“— to permit her to leave the house?” cackled Muriel. “And
yet she was never taken to St. Mungo’s and no Healer was ever
summoned to see her!” “Really, Muriel, how can you possibly know
whether— “
“For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a
Healer at St. Mungo’s at the time, and he told my family in
strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All
most suspicious, Lancelot thought!”
Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who
seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more
155
Chapter 8
champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once
shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the
crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore’s sister suffered the same
fate in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? Had Dumbledore
truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove
himself brilliant and talented?
“Now, if Kendra hadn’t died first,” Muriel resumed, “I’d have
said that it was she who finished off Ariana— “
“How can you, Muriel!” groaned Doge. “A mother kill her own
daughter? Think what you’re saying!”
“If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her
daughter for years on end, why not?” shrugged Auntie Muriel.
“But as I say, it doesn’t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana—
of what, nobody ever seemed sure— “
“Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and
killed Kendra in the struggle,” said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully.
“Shake your head all you like, Elphias. You were at Ariana’s funeral, were you not?”
“Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips, “and a
more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was
heartbroken— “
“His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth break Albus’
nose halfway through the service?”
If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how
he looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly
and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her
chin.
“How do you—?” croaked Doge.
“My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,” said Auntie Muriel happily. “Bathilda described the whole thing to mother
156
The Wedding
while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way
Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus’ fault
that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that’s odd
enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel
with both hands tied behind his back.
Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those
old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge.
Harry did not know what to think, what to believe. He wanted
the truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that
Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore
would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his
own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about
the story.
“And I’ll tell you something else,” Muriel said, hiccuping
slightly as she lowered her goblet. “I think Bathilda has spilled
the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter’s interview
about an important source close to the Dumbledores— goodness
knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would
fit!”
“Bathilda, would never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge.
“Bathilda Bagshot?” Harry said. “The author of A History of
Magic?”
The name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s textbooks,
though admittedly not one of the ones he had read more attentively.
“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drowning
man at a life heir. “A most gifted magical historian and an old
friend of Albus’s.”
“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie Muriel cheerfully.
157
Chapter 8
“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have
taken advantage of her,” said Doge, “and no reliance can be placed
on anything Bathilda may have said!”
“Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure
Rita Skeeter knows them all,” said Auntie Muriel “But even if
Bathilda’s completely cuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for
years. . . . Well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.”
Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge
banged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel
through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he
asked, “Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?”
“Oh yes, she’s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved
there after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.”
“The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow?”
“Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie Muriel testily.
Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones
in Godric’s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to
Dumbledore’s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their
graves, perhaps walked past Lily’s and James’s to do so? And he
had never once told Harry . . . never bothered to say . . .
And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to
himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him
that they had this place and these experiences in common. He
stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around
him, and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the
crowd until she drew up a chair beside him.
“I simply can’t dance anymore,” she panted, slipping of one of
her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. “Ron’s gone looking to
158
The Wedding
find more butterbeers. It’s a bit odd. I’ve just seen Viktor storming
away from Luna’s father, it looked like they’d been arguing— ” She
dropped her voice, staring at him. “Harry, are you okay?”
Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter,
at that moment, something large and silver came falling through
the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx
landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads
turned, as those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. Then the
Patronus’s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow
voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.
“The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.”
159
Chapter 9
A Place to Hide
E
verything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and Hermione
jumped to their feet and drew their wands. Many people were only just realizing that something strange had
happened; heads were still turning toward the silver
cat as it vanished. Silence spread outward in cold ripples from the
place where the Patronus had landed. Then somebody screamed.
Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd.
Guests were sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating;
the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken.
“Ron!” Hermione cried. “Ron, where are you?”
As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw
cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then he saw
Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them
shout, “Protego!”, a cry that was echoed on all sides—
“Ron! Ron!” Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry
were buffered by terrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make
sure they weren’t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their
160
A Place to Hide
heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he
did not know—
And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione’s free
arm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were
extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was
Hermione’s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away
from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away,
perhaps, from Voldemort himself. . . .
“Where are we?” said Ron’s voice.
Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not
left the wedding after all: They still seemed to be surrounded by
people.
“Tottenham Court Road,” panted Hermione. “Walk, just walk,
we need to find somewhere for you to change.”
Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide
dark street thronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed
shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus rumbled
by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed;
Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes.
“Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into,” Ron told
her, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of
him.
“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?”
said Harry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. “All last year I
kept it on me and— “
“It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both of you,”
said Hermione, “Just try and act naturally until— this will do.”
She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy
161
Chapter 9
alleyway.
“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . . ” said
Harry, frowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except
her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging.
“Yes, they’re here,” said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron’s
utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt,
some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.
“How the ruddy hell—?”
“Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione. “Tricky, but
I think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we
need in here.” She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and
it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled
around inside it. “Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,” she said,
peering into it, “and I had them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh
well. . . . Harry, you’d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry
up and change. . . .”
“When did you do all this?” Harry asked as Ron stripped off
his robes.
“I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for
days, you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway. I
packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and
put it in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . .”
“You’re amazing, you are,” said Ron, handing her his bundledup robes.
“Thank you,” said Hermione, managing a small smile as she
pushed the robes into the bag. “Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!”
Harry threw his Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and
pulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only
162
A Place to Hide
just beginning to appreciate what had happened.
“The others—everybody at the wedding— “
“We can’t worry about that now,” whispered Hermione. “It’s
you they’re after, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more
danger by going back.”
“She’s right,” said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was
about to argue, even if he could not see his face. “Most of the
Order was there, they’ll look after everyone.” Harry nodded, then
remembered that they could not see him, and said, “Yeah.” But
he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.
“Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,” said Hermione.
They moved back up the side street and onto the main road
again, where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and
weaving across the pavement.
“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?”
Ron asked Hermione.
“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re
safer out in the Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to
be.”
“True,” said Ron, looking around, “but don’t you feel a bit—
exposed?”
“Where else is there?” asked Hermione, cringing as the men on
the other side of the road started wolf-whistling at her. “We can
hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could
try my parents’ home, though I think there’s a chance they might
check there. . . . Oh, I wish they’d shut up!”
“All right, darling?” the drunkest of the men on the other
163
Chapter 9
pavement was yelling. “Fancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and
have a pint!”
“Let’s sit down somewhere,” Hermione said hastily as Ron
opened his mouth to shout back across the road. “Look, this will
do, in here!”
It was a small and shabby all-night A light layer of grease
lay on all the Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty.
Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite
Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it:
She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a
twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the
illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the
last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their
usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and
put them on again.
After a minute or two, Ron said, “You know, we’re not far from
the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross— “
“Ron, we can’t!” said Hermione at once.
“Not to stay there, but to find out what’s going on!”
“We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?”
“Okay, okay, it was just an idea!”
They relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress
shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry
was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of
burly workmen entered the and squeezed into the next booth.
Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper.
“I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the
164
A Place to Hide
countryside. Once we’re there, we could send a message to the
Order.”
“Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?” asked Ron.
“I’ve been practicing and I think so,” said Hermione.
“Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, though they
might’ve been arrested already. God, that’s revolting,” Ron added
after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard;
she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers’ orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond
and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her
away. She stared, affronted.
“Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,” said
Ron. “Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?”
“Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came
to the Burrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,” sighed
Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag.
The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew
their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto
her bench. The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the
tiled wall where Ron’s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible,
yelled, “Stupefy!”
The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of
red light: He slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining
black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot—
the waitress screamed and ran for the door—Harry sent another
165
Chapter 9
Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had
tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and
hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.
“Expulso!” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind
which Harry was standing blew up: The force of the explosion
slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as
the Cloak slipped off him.
“Petrificus Totalus!” screamed Hermione from out of sight, and
the Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione
crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over.
“D–diffindo,” she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared
in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep
cut. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my hand’s shaking! Diffindo!”
The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his
arms to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and
climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater
was sprawled across the bench.
“I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,” he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with
his foot; the man’s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron and
Hermione.
“That’s Dolohov,” said Ron. “I recognize him from the old
wanted posters. I think the big one’s Thorfinn Rowle.”
“Never mind what they’re called!” said Hermione a little hysterically. “How did they find us? What are we going to do?”
Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head.
166
A Place to Hide
“Lock the door,” he told her, “and Ron, turn out the lights.”
He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the
lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the into
darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione
earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.
“What are we going to do with them?” Ron whispered to Harry
through the dark; then, even more quietly, “Kill them? They’d kill
us. They had a good go just now.”
Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook
his head.
“We just need to wipe their memories,” said Harry. “It’s better
like that, it’ll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it’d be
obvious we were here.”
“You’re the boss,” said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved.
“But I’ve never down a Memory Charm.”
“Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.”
She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at
Dolohov’s forehead and said, “Obliviate.”
At once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy.
“Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back. “Take care
of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.”
“Clear up?” said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed
“Why?”
“Don’t you think they might wonder what’s happened if they
wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it’s just been
bombed?”
“Oh right, yeah . . . ”
Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his
167
Chapter 9
wand from his pocket.
“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old
jeans, they’re tight.”
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the
waitress out of sight of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a
suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead.
Once the was restored to its previous condition, they
heaved the Death Eaters back into their booth and propped them
up facing each other.
“But how did they find us?” Hermione asked, looking from one
inert man to the other. “How did they know where we were?”
She turned to Harry.
“You—you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do
you, Harry?”
“He can’t have,” said Ron. “The Trace breaks at seventeen,
that’s Wizarding law, you can’t put it on an adult.”
“As far as you know,” said Hermione. “What if the Death
Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?”
“But Harry hasn’t been near a Death Eater in the last twentyfour hours. Who’s supposed to have put a Trace back on him?”
Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was
that really how the Death Eaters had found them?
“If I can’t use magic, and you can’t use magic near me, without
us giving away our position— ” he began.
“We’re not splitting up!” said Hermione firmly.
“We need a safe place to hide,” said Ron. “Give us time to
think things through.”
“Grimmauld Place,” said Harry.
168
A Place to Hide
The other two gaped.
“Don’t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!”
“Ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him— and even
if they haven’t worked,” he pressed on as Hermione began to argue
“so what? I swear, I’d like nothing better than to meet Snape!”
“But— “
“Hermione, where else is there? It’s the best chance we’ve got.
Snape’s only one Death Eater. If I’ve still got the Trace on me,
we’ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.”
She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked
to. While she unlocked the door, Ron clicked the Deluminator
to release the light. Then, on Harry’s count of three, they
reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress
or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily,
Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished
into the compressing darkness once more.
Seconds later Harry’s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened
his eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small
and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them
from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had
been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and
they rushed toward it, checking every few yards that they were not
being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and
Harry tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard a
series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door
swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold.
As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas
lamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of
169
Chapter 9
the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing
odd shadows up the staircase. Long dark curtains concealed the
portrait of Sirius’s mother. The only thing that was out of place
was the troll’s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if
Tonks had just knocked it over again.
“I think somebody’s been in here,” Hermione whispered, pointing toward it.
“That could’ve happened as the Order left,” Ron murmured
back.
“So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?” Harry
asked.
“Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron.
Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against
the door, scared to move farther into the house.
“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a
step forward.
“Severus Snape?”
Mad-Eye Moody’s voice whispered out of the darkness, making
all three of them jump back in fright. “We’re not Snape!” croaked
Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his
tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak.
Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue
had unraveled again.
The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant
sensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered,
“That m–must have b–been the T–Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye
set up for Snape!”
170
A Place to Hide
Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted
in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them
could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet,
tall, dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs.
Black, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward
them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming
behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing
at Harry.
“No!” Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no
spell occurred to him. “No! It wasn’t us! We didn’t kill you— “
On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust:
Coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione
crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head, and
Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on
the shoulder and saying, “It’s all r–right. . . . It’s g–gone. . . .” Dust
swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs.
Black continued to scream.
“Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the
house of my fathers—“
“SHUT UP!” Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and
with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut
again, silencing her.
“That . . . that was . . . ” Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped
her to her feet.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but it wasn’t really him, was it? Just
something to scare Snape.”
Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted
171
Chapter 9
the horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall,
half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved
except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board.
“Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” whispered
Hermione, and she raised her wand and said, “Homenum revelio.”
Nothing happened.
“Well, you’ve just had a big shock,” said Ron kindly. “What
was that supposed to do?”
“It did what I meant it to do!” said Hermione rather crossly.
“That was a spell to reveal human presence, and there’s nobody
here except us!”
“And old Dusty,” said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from
which the corpse-figure had risen.
“Let’s go up,” said Hermione with a frightened look at the same
spot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing
room on the first floor. Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old
gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty room, she perched
on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to
the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch.
“Can’t see anyone out there,” he reported. “And you’d think,
if Harry still had a Trace on him, they’d have followed us here. I
know they can’t get in the house, but—what’s up, Harry?”
Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned against as
something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He
saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound
through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock.
“What did you see?” Ron asked, advancing on Harry. “Did
172
A Place to Hide
you see him at my place?”
“No, I just felt anger—he’s really angry— “
“But that could be at the Burrow,” said Ron loudly. “What
else? Didn’t you see anything? Was he cursing someone?”
“No, I just felt anger— I couldn’t tell— “
Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as
she said in a frightened voice, “Your scar, again? But what’s going
on? I thought that connection had closed!”
“It did, for a while,” muttered Harry; his scar was still painful,
which made it hard to concentrate. “I–I think it’s started opening
again whenever he loses control, that’s how it used to— “
“But then you’ve got to close your mind!” said Hermione shrilly.
“Harry, Dumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection, he
wanted you to shut it down, that’s why you were supposed to use
Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your
mind, remember— “
“Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said Harry through gritted
teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had
once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into
a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius’s death. He wished that he
had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort
more threatening, as though he were pressing against the window
of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he
fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick.
He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then
Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around
to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window
173
Chapter 9
and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into
the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father. “Family safe,
do not reply, we are being watched.”
The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise
between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. “They’re all right, they’re all
right!” she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her.
“Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, “I— “
“It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain in his
head. “It’s your family, ’course you were worried. I’d feel the same
way.” He thought of Ginny. “I do feel the same way.”
The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had
back in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say
“I don’t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags
I’ve brought and camp in here tonight?”
He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer.
He had to succumb.
“Bathroom,” he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he
could without running. He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and
fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that
did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only
by firelight, and the giant blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand
outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice.
“More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord
Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called
me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again?
174
A Place to Hide
Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. . . . Do it, or feel
my wrath yourself!”
A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a
terrified, pointed white face—with a sense of emerging from deep
water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes.
He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose
inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large
bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy’s gaunt, petrified face seemed burned
on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen,
by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort.
There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione’s voice rang out.
“Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I’ve got it here.”
“Yeah, great, thanks,” he said, fighting to keep his voice casual
as he stood up to let her in.
175
Chapter 10
Kreacher’s Tale
H
arry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping
bag on the drawing room floor. A chink of sky was
visible between the heavy curtains. It was the cool,
clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night
and dawn, and everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermione’s
slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they
made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry
and insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so
that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm curved to the
floor, her fingers inches from Ron’s. Harry wondered whether they
had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely
lonely.
He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier.
Less than twenty— four hours ago, he had been standing in the
sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in wedding
guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen now?
He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting
complex mission Dumbledore had left him. . . . Dumbledore . . .
176
Kreacher’s Tale
The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore’s death felt
different now. The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the
wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things,
infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley,
content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect
him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being
imprisoned and hidden?
Harry thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had
never mentioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledore’s will, and resentment swelled in
the darkness. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn’t he
explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all?
Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and
honed, but not trusted, never confided in?
Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter
thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bad, picked up his wand,
and crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, “Lumos,”
and started to climb the stairs by wandlight.
On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron
had slept last time they had been here; he glanced into it. The
wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped
back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs.
Somebody had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape?
Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house
both before and after Sirius died? Harry’s gaze wandered to the
portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s
great-great-grandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a
177
Chapter 10
stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster’s study at Hogwarts.
Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two doors. The one facing him bore a
nameplate reading Sirius. Harry had never entered his godfather’s
bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand high
to cast light as widely as possible. The room was spacious and
must once have been handsome. There was a large bed with a
carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet
curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle scrubs
still resting in its sockets, solid wax banging in frostlike drips. A
fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed’s
headboard; a spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the
top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved deeper into
the room, he head a scurrying of disturbed mice.
The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters
and pictures that little of the walls silvery-gray silk was visible.
Harry could only assume that Sirius’s parents had been unable to
remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall
because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest
son’s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have lone gone out of
his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor
banners, faded scarlet and hold just to underline his difference from
all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of
Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius’s nerve)
several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls. Harry could tell that
they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within
their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper.
This was in contrast the only Wizarding photograph on the walls
178
Kreacher’s Tale
which was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in
arm, laughing at the camera.
With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father, his untidy
black hair stuck up at the back like Harry’s, and he too wore glasses.
Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant
face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it
alive. To Sirius’s right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter,
plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in
this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James
and Sirius had been. On James’s left was Lupin, even then a little
shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at
finding himself liked and included or was it simply because Harry
knew how it had been, that he saw these things in the picture? He
tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had
left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no
chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room.
Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brighter: A shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books, and
small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius’s bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have
been judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books
had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the covers
and sundry pages littered the floor.
Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and
examined them. He recognized one as a part of an old edition of A
History of Magic, by Barhilda Bagshot, and another as belonging
to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten
and crumpled. He smoothed it out.
179
Chapter 10
Dear Padfoot, Thank you, thank you, for Harry’s birthday
present! It was his favorite by far. One year old and
already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so
pleased with himself. I’m enclosing a picture so you can
see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground
but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase
Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of
course James thought it was so funny, says he’s going to be
a great Quidditch player, but we’ve had to pack away all
the ornaments and make sure we don’t take our eyes off
him when he gets going.
We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda
who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry.
We were so sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to
come first, and Harry’s not old enough to know it’s his
birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up
here, he tries not to show it but I can tell— also
Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance
of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him
up so much. Wormy was here last weekend. I thought he
seemed down, but that was probably the next about the
McKinnons; I cried all evening when I heard.
Bathilda drops in most days, she’s a fascinating old thing
with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore. I’m not
sure he’d be pleased if he knew! I don’t know how much to
believe, actually because it seems incredible that
Dumbledore
Harry’s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite
still, holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while
180
Kreacher’s Tale
inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent joy and grief thundering
its equal measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he sat
down.
He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time, and was reduced to staring
at the handwriting itself. She had made her “g”s the same way
he did. He searched through the letter for every one of them, and
each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil.
The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had
lived, really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this
parchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about
him, Harry, her son. Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his
eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating on the meaning.
It was like listening to a half-remembered voice.
They had a cat . . . perhaps it had perished, like his parents
at Godric’s Hollow . . . or else fled when there was nobody left to
feed it . . . Sirius had bought him his first broomstick . . . His parents had known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced
them? Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak . . . there was
something funny there . . . Harry paused, pondering his mother’s
words. Why had Dumbledore taken James’s Invisibility Cloak?
Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before, “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible” Perhaps some less
gifted Order member had needed its assistance, and Dumbledore
had acted as a carrier? Harry passed on. . . .
Wormy was here . . . Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed “down”
had he? Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for
the last time?
And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about
181
Chapter 10
Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore —
That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things
that would seem incredible about Dumbledore; that he had once
received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance or
had taken up goat charming like Aberforth. . . .
Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of
the letter was here somewhere. He seized papers, treating them in
his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher,
he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run
his hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed
and armchair.
At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked
like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he
pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph that Lily had
described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and
out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a
pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after
him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily’s letter
and continued to look for the second sheet.
After another quarter of an hour, however he was forced to
conclude that the rest of his mother’s letter was gone. Had it
simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had
been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the
room? Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues
as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy
broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death
Eaters . . . The only potentially useful thing he could see her was
possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore —what?
182
Kreacher’s Tale
“Harry? Harry? Harry!”
“I’m here!” he called, “What’s happened?”
There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione
burst inside.
“We woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she said breathlessly. She turned and shouted over her shoulder, “Ron! I’ve found
him”
Ron’s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below.
“Good! Tell him from me he’s a git!”
“Harry don’t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did
you come up here anyway?” She gazed around the ransacked room.
“What have you been doing?”
“Look what I’ve just found”
He held out his mother’s letter. Hermione took it out and read
it while Harry watched her. When she reached the end of the page
she looked up at him.
“Oh Harry . . . ”
“And there’s this too.”
He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at
the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.
“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry said, “but
it’s not here”
Hermione glanced around.
“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you
got here?”
“Someone had searched before me,” said Harry.
“I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had
been disturbed. What were they after, do you think?”
“Information on the Order, if it was Snape”
183
Chapter 10
“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed. I mean was
in the Order, wasn’t he?”
“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about
information on Dumbledore? The second page of the letter, for
instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know
who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of— “
“A History of Magic,” said Hermione, looking interested. “So
your parents knew her? She was an incredible magic historian.”
“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s
Hollow. Ron’s Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding.
She knew Dumbledore’s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk
to, wouldn’t she?”
There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him for Harry’s liking. He took back the letter and the
photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so
as not to have to look at her and give himself away.
“I understand why you’d love to talk to her about, and Dumbledore too,” said Hermione. “But that wouldn’t really help us in our
search for the Horcruxes, would it?” Harry did not answer, and she
rushed on, “Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric’s Hollow,
but I’m scared. I’m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found
us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than ever that we ought
to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I’m sure they’d
be expecting you to visit it.”
“It’s not just that,” Harry said, still avoiding looking at her,
“Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to
know the truth. . . .”
184
Kreacher’s Tale
He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When
he had finished, Hermione said, “Of course, I can see why that’s
upset you, Harry— “
“I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not
it’s true or— “
“Harry do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious
old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe
them? You knew Dumbledore!”
“I thought I did,” he muttered.
“But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita
wrote about you! Doge is right, how can you let these people
tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?”
He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt.
There it was again: Choose what to believe. He wanted the truth.
Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it?
“Shall we go down to the kitchen?” Hermione suggested after
a little pause. “Find something for breakfast?”
He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing
and past the second door that led off it. There were deep scratch
marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not noticed
in the dark. He passed at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a
porapous little sign, neatly lettered by hand the sort of thing that
Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door.
Do Not Enter
Without the Express Permission of
Regulus Arcturus Black
Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately
sure why. He read the sign again. Hermione was already a flight
of stairs below him.
185
Chapter 10
“Hermione,” he said, and he was surprised that his voice was
so calm. “Come back up here.”
“What’s the matter?”
“R.A.B. I think I’ve found him.”
There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs.
“In your mum’s letter? But I didn’t see— “
Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus’s sign. She read it,
then clutched Harry’s arm so tightly that he winced.
“Sirius’s brother?” she whispered.
“He was a Death Eater,” said Harry. “Sirius told me about
him, he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet
and tried to leave— so they killed him.”
“That fits!” gasped Hermione. “If he was a Death Eater he
had access to Voldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he
would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!”
She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed,
“Ron! RON! Get up here, quick!”
Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his
hand.
“What’s up? If it’s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I— “
He frowned at the sign on Regulus’s door, in which Hermione
was silently pointing.
“What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it? Regulus
Arcturus . . . Regulus . . . R.A.B.! The locket—you don’t reckon—
?”
“Let’s find out,” said Harry. He pushed the door: It was locked.
Hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said, “Alohamora.”
There was a click, and the door swung open.
186
Kreacher’s Tale
They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus’s bedroom was slightly smaller than Sirius’s, though it had
the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to
advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family, Regulus had
striven to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald
and silver were everywhere, draping the bead, the walls, and the
windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over
the bed, along with its motto, Toujours Pur. Beneath this was a
collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make
a ragged collage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them.
“They’re all about Voldemort,” she said. “Regulus seems
to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death
Eaters . . . ”
A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down
to read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph: a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out
of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned
on their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognizable as
the boy sitting in the middle of the front row: He had the same
dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was
smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been.
“He played Seeker,” said Harry.
“What?” said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in
Voldemort’s press clippings.
“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s where the
Seeker . . . Never mind,” said Harry, realizing that nobody was listening. Ron was on his hands and knees, searching under the
wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places
and approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched be187
Chapter 10
fore them. The drawers’ contents had been turned over recently,
the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills,
out-of-date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled,
a recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer.
“There’s an easier way,” said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky
fingers on his jeans. She raised her wand and said, “Accio Locket!”
Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of
the faded curtains, looked disappointed.
“Is that it, then? It’s not here?”
“Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,”
said Hermione. “Charms to prevent it from being summoned magically, you know.”
“Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” said Harry,
remembering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket.
“How are we supposed to find it then?” asked Ron.
“We search manually,” said Hermione.
“That’s a good idea,” said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed
his examination of the curtains.
They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour,
but were forced, finally, to conclude that the locket was not there.
The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the
grimy landing windows.
“It could be somewhere else in the house, though,” said Hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs. As Harry
and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have become
more determined. “Whether he’d manage to destroy it or not, he’d
want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn’t he? Remember
all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last
188
Kreacher’s Tale
time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes
that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them there to
protect the locket’s hiding place, even though we didn’t realize it
at . . . at . . . “
Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot
in midair, with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been
Obliviated: her eyes had even drifted out of focus.
“ . . . at the time,” she finished in a whisper.
“Something wrong?” asked Ron.
“There was a locket.”
“What?” said Harry and Ron together.
“In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it.
And we . . . we . . . “
Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest
into his stomach. He remembered. He had even handled the thing
as they passed it around, each trying in turn to pry it open. It
had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox
of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone
sleepy . . . ”
“Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,” said Harry. It
was the only chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he
was going to cling to it until forced to let go. “He had a whole
stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C’mon.”
He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other
two thundering along in his wake. They made so much noise that
they woke the portrait of Sirius’s mother as they passed through
the hall.
“Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!” she screamed after them as they
dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door
189
Chapter 10
behind them. Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt
at the door of Kreacher’s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There
was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the house-elf had once
slept, but they were not longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher
had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature’s
Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe his eyes,
Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse
fell out and rolled dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he
threw himself into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed her eyes.
“It’s not over yet,” said Harry, and he raised his voice and
called, “Kreacher!”
There was a loud crack and the house elf that Harry had so
reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front
of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, his pale
skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from
his batlike ears. He was still wearing the filthy rag in which they
had first met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon Harry
showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no
more than his outfit.
“Master,” croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice, and he
bowed low; muttering to his knees, “back in my Mistress’s old
house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood— “
“I forbid you to call anyone ’blood traitor’ or ’Mudblood,’”
growled Harry. He would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike
nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctively unlovable object even if
the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort.
“I’ve got a question for you,” said Harry, his heart beating
rather fast as he looked down at the elf, “and I order you to answer
it truthfully. Understand?”
190
Kreacher’s Tale
“Yes, Master,” said Kreacher, bowing low again. Harry saw his
lips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was
now forbidden to utter.
“Two years ago,” said Harry, his heart now hammering against
his ribs, “there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs.
We threw it out. Did you steal it back?”
There was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face. Then he said, “Yes.”
“Where is it now?” asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful. Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could
not bear to see their reactions to his next word.
“Gone.”
“Gone?” echoed Harry, elation floating out of him, “What do
you mean, it’s gone?”
The elf shivered. He swayed.
“Kreacher,” said Harry fiercely, “I order you— “
“Mundungus Fletcher,” croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut.
“Mundungus Fletcher stole it all; Miss Bella’s and Miss Cissy’s
pictures, my Mistress’s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class,
the goblets with the family crest, and— and— “
Kreacher was gulping for air: His hollow chest was rising and
falling rapidly, then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream.
“—and the locket, Master Regulus’s locket. Kreacher did wrong,
Kreacher failed in his orders!”
Harry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker
standing in the grate, he launched himself upon the elf, flattening
him. Hermione’s scream mingled with Kreacher’s but Harry bellowed louder than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay
191
Chapter 10
still!”
He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the
cold stone floor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes.
“Harry, let him up!” Hermione whispered.
“So he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted Harry,
kneeling beside the elf. “I don’t think so. Right. Kreacher, I
want the truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the
locket?”
“Kreacher saw him!” gasped the elf as tears poured over his
snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth. “Kreacher saw him
coming out of Kreacher’s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher’s
treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus
Fletcher laughed and r-ran. . . . “
“You called the locket ’Master Regulus’s,’” said Harry. “Why?
Where did it come from? What did Regulus have to do with it?
Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket,
and everything Regulus had to do with it!”
The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between
his knees, and began to rock backward and forward. When he
spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, echoing
kitchen.
“Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy
and broke my Mistress’s heart with his lawless ways. But Master
Regulus had proper order; he knew what was due to the name of
Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of
the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding
to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns . . . and when he was
sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud,
so proud, so happy to serve . . .
192
Kreacher’s Tale
And one day, a year after he joined, Master Regulus came
down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked
Kreacher. And Master Regulus said . . . he said . . . ”
The old elf rocked faster than ever.
“ . . . he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.”
“Voldemort needed an elf?” Harry repeated, looking around at
Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did.
“Oh yes,” moaned Kreacher. “And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an
honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever
the Dark Lord ordered him to do . . . and then to c–come home.”
Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs.
“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not
tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him
to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave was a cavern, and
in the cavern was a great black lake . . . “
The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up. Kreacher’s
croaking voice seemed to come to him from across the dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been
present.
“ . . . There was a boat . . . ”
Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly
green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim
toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort
had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux, by borrowing a
disposable creature, a house-elf . . .
“There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D–Dark
Lord made Kreacher drink it. . . .”
The elf quaked from head to foot.
193
Chapter 10
“Kreacher drank, and as he drank he saw terrible
things . . . Kreacher’s insides burned . . . Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but
the Dark Lord only laughed . . . He made Kreacher drink all the
potion . . . He dropped a locket into the empty basin . . . He filled
it with more potion.”
“And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the
island . . . “
Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort’s white,
snakelike face vanishing into darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes,
whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning
poison caused its victim . . . But here, Harry’s imagination could
go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped.
“Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s edge and he
drank from the black lake . . . and hands, dead hands, came out of
the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface . . . “
“How did you get away?” Harry asked, and he was not surprised
to hear himself whispering.
Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked Harry with his great,
bloodshot eyes. “Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he
said.
“I know—but how did you escape the Inferi?”
Kreacher did not seem to understand.
“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he repeated.
“I know, but— “
“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, Harry?” said Ron. “He Disapparated!”
“But . . . you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that cave,” said
194
Kreacher’s Tale
Harry, “otherwise Dumbledore— “
“Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said Ron, “I mean,
they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when
we can’t.”
There was a silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? But even as he thought this,
Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy.
“Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of houseelves far beneath his notice . . . It would never have occurred to him
that they might have magic that he didn’t.”
“The house-elf’s highest law is his Master’s bidding,” intoned
Kreacher. “Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came
home. . . . “
“Well, then, you did what you were told, didn’t you?” said
Hermione kindly. “You didn’t disobey orders at all!”
Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever.
“So what happened when you got back?” Harry asked. “What
did Regulus say when you told him what happened?”
“Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,” croaked
Kreacher. “Master Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not
to leave the house. And then . . . it was a little while later . . . Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and
Master Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in
his mind, Kreacher could tell . . . and he asked Kreacher to take
him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark
Lord. . . . “
And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite
clearly, the frightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had
so resembled Sirius. . . . Kreacher knew how to open the concealed
195
Chapter 10
entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny
boat; this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to
the island with its basin of poison. . . .
“And he made you drink the poison?” said Harry, disgusted.
But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione’s hands leapt
to her mouth: She seemed to have understood something.
“M—Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one
the Dark Lord had,” said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side
of his snoutlike nose. “And he told Kreacher to take it and, when
the basin was empty, to switch the lockets . . . ”
Kreacher’s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to understand him.
“And he order—Kreacher to leave—without him. And he told
Kreacher— to go home— and never to tell my Mistress—what he
had done—but to destroy— the first locket. And he drank— all the
potion— and Kreacher swapped the lockets— and watched . . . as
Master Regulus . . . was dragged beneath the water . . . and . . . “
“Oh, Kreacher!” wailed Hermione, who was crying. She
dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him. At
once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously
repulsed.
“The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what
would his Mistress say?”
“I told you not to call her ’Mudblood’!” snarled Harry, but
the elf was already punishing himself. He fell to the ground and
banged his forehead on the floor
“Stop him— stop him!” Hermione cried. “Oh, don’t you see
now how sick it is, the way they’ve got to obey?”
“Kreacher— stop, stop!” shouted Harry.
196
Kreacher’s Tale
The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus
glistening around his snot, a bruise already blooming on his pallid
forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so
pitiful.
“So you brought the locket home,” he said relentlessly, for he
was determined to know the full story. “And you tried to destroy
it?”
“Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,” moaned the
elf. “Kreacher tried everything, everything he knew, but nothing,
nothing would work. . . . So many powerful spells upon the casing,
Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it
would not open . . . Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he
punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders,
Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his mistress was mad
with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher
could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus
had f–f–forbidden him to tell any of the f–f–family what happened
in the c-cave . . . ”
Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears flowed down Hermione’s cheeks as she watched
Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who
was no fan of Kreacher’s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his
heels and shook his head, trying to clear it.
“I don’t understand you, Kreacher,” he said finally. “Voldemort
tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you
were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to
go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort
through them . . . “
197
Chapter 10
“Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand. “He’s a slave; house-elves
are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to
Kreacher wasn’t that far out of the common way. What do wizard
wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He’s loyal to people who are
kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs.
I know what you’re going to say,” she went on as Harry began to
protest, “that Regulus changed his mind . . . but he doesn’t seem
to have explained that to Kreacher, does he?” And I think I know
why. Kreacher and Regulus’s family were all safest if they kept to
the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.”
“Sirius— “
“Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it’s no good looking
like that, you know it’s true. Kreacher had been alone for such
a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably
starving for a bit of affection. I’m sure ‘Miss Cissy’ and ‘Miss
Bella’ were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he
did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know.
I’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat houseelves. Well, Voldemort did . . . and so did Sirius.”
Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the
floor, he remembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere
hours after Sirius’s death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher
as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s. . . .
“Kreacher,” said Harry after a while, “when you feel up to it,
er. . . . please sit up.”
It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into
silence. Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rub198
Kreacher’s Tale
bing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child.
“Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” said Harry.
He glanced at Hermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order
kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it was not
an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained
her approval: She smiled encouragingly.
“Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus
Fletcher. We need to find out where the locket—where Master
Regulus’s locket is. It’s really important. We want to finish the
work Master Regulus started, we want to—er—ensure that he
didn’t die in vain.”
Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry.
“Find Mundungus Fletcher?” he croaked.
“And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. “Do
you think you could do that for us?”
As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden
inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid’s purse and took out the fake
Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the
note to Voldemort.
“Kreacher, I’d, er, like you to have this,” he said, pressing the
locket into the elf’s hand. “This belonged to Regulus and I’m sure
he’d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you— “
“Overkill, mate,” said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket,
let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto
the ground.
It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who
was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for
his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly.
When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied
199
Chapter 10
him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his
dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away. He then made two low
bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione’s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful
salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.
200
Chapter 11
The Bribe
I
f Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours
at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state
of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that
morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread,
upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help.
Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after
that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing
in the direction of the house that they cannot see.
“Death Eaters, for sure,” said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione
watched from the drawing room windows. “Reckon they know
we’re in here?”
“I don’t think so,” said Hermione, though she looked frightened,
“or they’d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn’t they?”
“D’you reckon he’s been in here and had his tongue tied by
201
Chapter 11
Moody’s curse?” asked Ron.
“Yes,” said Hermione, “otherwise he’d have been able to tell
that lot how to get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re probably watching
to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house,
after all.”
“How do they—?” began Harry.
“Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember?
They’ll know Sirius left you the place.”
The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous
mood inside number twelves. They had not heard a word from
anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus,
and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had
developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in
his pocket. This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling
away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the
Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on
and off.
“Will you stop it!” she cried out on the third evening of
Kreacher’s absence, as all light was sucked from the drawing room
yet again.
“Sorry, sorry!” said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. “I don’t know I’m doing it!”
“Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?”
“What, like reading kids’ stories?”
“Dumbledore left me this book, Ron— ”
“— and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use
it!”
Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room
unnoticed by either of them. He headed downstairs toward the
202
The Bribe
kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where
Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of
stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then
metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.
Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his
wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads,
and waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit
square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed
the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s
voice asked, “Severus Snape?” Then the dust figure rose from the
end of the hall, and rushed him, raising its dead hand.
“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice.
The jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was
impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud
it left behind.
Harry pointed his wand into the middle of it.
“Don’t move!”
He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black. At the sound of
his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream,
“Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house—”
Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry,
wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with
his arms raised in the hill below.
“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!”
“Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, pointing her
wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished
shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry
did not.
“Show yourself!” he called back.
203
Chapter 11
Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high
in a gesture of surrender.
“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as
Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married
to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to
produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.”
“Oh, all right.” said Harry, lowering his wand, “but I had to
check, didn’t I?”
“Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I
quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t
be quite so quick to lower your defenses.”
They ran down the stairs toward him. Wrapped I a thick black
traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them.
“No sign of Severus then?” he asked.
“No,” said Harry, “What’s going on? Is everyone okay?”
“Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There are a
couple of Death Eaters in the square outside— ”
“We know— ”
“I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the
front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t
know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there;
they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you,
Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to
know what’s happened after you left the Burrow.”
They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her
wand at the gate. A fire sprang up instantly. It gave the illusion of
coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden
table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling
cloak and they sat down.
204
The Bribe
“I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the
Death Eater tailing me,” said Lupin. “So, you came straight here
after the wedding?”
“No,” said Harry, “only after we ran into a couple of Death
Eaters in a on Tottenham Court Road.”
Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front.
“What?”
They explained what had happened; when they had finished,
Lupin looked aghast.
“But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track
anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear.”
“And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?” said Harry.
“We wondered,” said Hermione tentatively, “whether Harry
could still have the Trace on him?”
“Impossible,” said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt
hugely relieved. “Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure
Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they?
But I can’t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham
Court Road, that’s worrying, really worrying.”
He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that
question could wait.
“Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing
since Ron’s dad told us the family were safe.”
“Well, Kingsley saved us,” said Lupin. “Thanks to his warning
most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they
arrived.”
“Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?” interjected Her205
Chapter 11
mione.
“A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same
thing now,” said Lupin. “There were about a dozen of them, but
they didn’t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that
they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before
they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.”
Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected
the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act
had been to try to protect Harry.
“The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,”
Lupin went on. “They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get to
close— and then they interrogated those of us who remained for
hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but
of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been
there.
“At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Orderconnected house in the country. No deaths,” he added quickly,
forstalling the question, “but they were rough. They burned down
Dedalus Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and they
used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family. Again, trying to find
out where you went after you visited them. They’re all right—
shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.”
“The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?”
Harry asked, remembering how effective those had been on the
night he had crashed in Tonks’s parents’ garden.
“What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters
have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,” said
206
The Bribe
Lupin. “They’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without
fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every
defensive spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were
completely open about why they’d come.”
“And are they bothering an excuse for torturing Harry’s whereabouts out of people?” asked Hermione, an edge to her voice.
“Well,” said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy
of the Daily Prophet.
“Here,” he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, “you’ll
know sooner or later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after
you.”
Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own
face filled the front page. He read the headline over it:
WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT
THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any
more: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had
been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the wizarding
world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after
Dumbledore had fallen.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said.
“So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?”
asked Hermione furiously.
Lupin nodded.
“But surely people realize what’s going on?”
“The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said Lupin.
207
Chapter 11
“The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned;
he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius
Curse.”
“Why didn’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?”
asked Ron.
Lupin laughed.
“He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively he is the Minister, but
why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet,
Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort
free to extend his power beyond the ministry.
“Naturally many people have deduced what has happened:
There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the
last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be
behind it. However, that is not the point: They whisper. They
daren’t confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they
are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their
families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game.
Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining
masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.”
“And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,” said Harry, “involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?”
“That’s certainly part of it,” said Lupin, “and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you— the Boy Who Lived—
were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance
to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old
hero’s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head,
but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended
you.
208
The Bribe
“Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggleborns.”
Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet.
“Look at page two.”
Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of
distaste she had worn when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art.
“‘Muggle-born Register,’” she read aloud, “‘The Ministry of
Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called “Muggle-borns,” the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets.
“‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries
reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when
Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists,
therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force.
“‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called
Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.’”
“People won’t let this happen,” said Ron.
“It is happening, Ron,’; said Lupin. “Muggle-borns are being
rounded up as we speak.”
“But how are they supposed to have ‘stolen’ magic?” said Ron.
“It’s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any Squibs,
would there?”
“I know,” said Lupin. “Nevertheless, unless you can prove that
you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed
to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the
punishment.”
Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, “What if purebloods and
209
Chapter 11
half-bloods swear a Muggle-born’s part of their family? I’ll tell
everyone Hermione’s my cousin— ”
Hermione covered Ron’s hand with hers and squeezed it.
“Thank you, Ron, but I couldn’t let you— ”
“You won’t have a choice,” said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand
back. “I’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions
on it.”
Hermione gave a shaky laugh.
“Ron, as we’re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted
person in the country, I don’t think it matters. If I was going back
to school it would be different. What’s Voldemort planning for
Hogwarts?” she asked Lupin.
“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,” he replied. “That was announced yesterday. It’s a change,
because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every
witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but
their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them
abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole
Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it’s
also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students
must be given Blood Status—meaning that they have proven to
the ministry that they are of wizard descent—before they are allowed to attend.”
Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited elevenyear-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spellbooks, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never
see their families again either.
“It’s . . . it’s . . . ” he muttered, struggling to find words that did
justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly,
210
The Bribe
“I know.”
Lupin hesitated.
“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order
is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.”
“He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are in on it
and they’re coming with me.”
“Can you confide in me what the mission is?”
Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick
but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer.
“I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I
don’t think I can.”
“I thought you’d say that,” said Lupin, looking disappointed.
“But I ought still be of some use to you. You know what I am and
what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There
would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.”
Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they
would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were
with them all the time he could not imagine.
Hermione, however, looked puzzled.
“But what about Tonks?” she asked.
“What about her?” said Lupin.
“Well,” said Hermione, frowning, “you’re married: How does
she feel about you going away with us?”
“Tonks will be perfectly safe.” said Lupin. “She’ll be at her
parents’ house.”
There was something strange in Lupin’s tone; it was almost
cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining
hidden at her parents house; she was, after all, a member of the
211
Chapter 11
Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the
thick of the action.
“Remus,” said Hermione tentatively, “is everything all
right . . . you know . . . between you and— ”
“Everything is fine, thank you,” said Lupin pointedly.
Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward
and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing
himself to admit something unpleasant. “Tonks is going to have a
baby.”
“Oh, how wonderful!” squealed Hermione.
“Excellent!” said Ron enthusiastically.
“Congratulations,” said Harry.
Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then
said, “So . . . do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I
cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all.
And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many
of us have never encountered or imagined.”
Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry.
“Just— just to be clear,” he said. “You want to leave Tonks at
her parents’ house and come away with us?”
“She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her,” said
Lupin. He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference. “Harry,
I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.”
“Well,” said Harry slowly, “I’m not. I’m pretty sure my father
would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own
kid, actually.”
Lupin’s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen
might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as
212
The Bribe
though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione’s eyes
swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin.
“You don’t understand,” said Lupin at last.
“Explain, then,” said Harry.
Lupin swallowed.
“I–I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against
my better judgment and I have regretted it very much ever since.”
“I see,” said Harry, “so you’re just going to dump her and the
kid and run off with us?”
Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled backward, and he
glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever,
the shadow of the wolf upon his human face.
“Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I’ve made her an
outcast!”
Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned.
“You have only seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s protection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of
the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of
my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve
done? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, when
parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the
child— the child— ”
Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite
deranged.
“My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced
of it—how can I forgive myself when I knowingly risked passing on
my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle,
it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so,
213
Chapter 11
without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!”
“Remus!” whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. “Don’t say
that—how could any child be ashamed of you?”
“Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,” said Harry. “I’d be pretty
ashamed of him.”
Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had
propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had
hit him.
“If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,” Harry said,
“what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father’s in the Order?
My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon
he’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?”
“How—how dare you?” said Lupin. “This is not about a desire
for— for danger of personal glory—how dare you suggest such a—
”
“I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil.” Harry said, “You
fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoe— ”
“Harry, no!” Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare
into Lupin’s livid face.
“I’d never have believed this,” Harry said. “The man who
taught me to fight dementors— a coward.”
Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for
his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward
as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the
floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing around the
door.
“Remus, Remus, come back!” Hermione cried, but Lupin did
not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam.
“Harry!” wailed Hermione. “How could you?”
214
The Bribe
“It was easy,” said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a lump
swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of
anger he was shaking.
“Don’t look at me like that!” he snapped at Hermione.
“Don’t you start on her!” snarked Ron.
“No—no—we mustn’t fight!” said Hermione, launching herself
between them.
“You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” Ron told Harry.
“He had it coming to him,” said Harry. Broken images were
racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil;
Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light
and his mother’s voice, begging for mercy . . .
“Parents,” said Harry, “shouldn’t leave their kids unless—unless they’ve got to.”
“Harry— ” said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but
he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione
had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace,
seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him.
Now Lupin’s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before
him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each
other behind his back, communicating silently.
He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from
each other.
“I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.”
“No, you shouldn’t,” said Ron at once.
“But he’s acting like one.”
“All the same . . . ” said Hermione.
“I know,” said Harry. “but if it makes him go back to Tonks,
215
Chapter 11
it’ll be worth it, won’t it?”
He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked
sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had
said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had
treated his old friend?
The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione’s unspoken reproaches.
The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table,
Harry’s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He
walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and
pretended to read. He could not take in the words, his mind was
still full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and
Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other
side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s
name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took
in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group.
Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family,
left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra;
and Aberforth.
His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with
eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph.
The baby, Ariana, was little longer than a loaf of bread and no
more distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair
pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it.
Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he’d see as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally
composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth
216
The Bribe
wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulderlength hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but otherwise
the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus’s nose
had been broken and before he started wearing glasses.
Thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he
already did, Harry began to read:
Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not
bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow,
the village that was later to gain fame as the scene
of Harry Potter’s strange escape from You-KnowWho.
Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric’s Hollow was
home to a number of Wizarding families, but as
Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the
curiosity about her husband’s crime she had faced
in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the
friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors,
she soon ensured that her family was left well alone.
“Slammed the door in my face when I went
around to welcome her with a batch of homemade
Cauldron Cakes,” says Bathilda Bagshot. “The first
year they were there I only ever saw the two boys.
Wouldn’t have known there was a daughter if I
hadn’t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the
winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading
Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round
217
Chapter 11
the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took
her back inside. Didn’t know what to make of it.”
It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric’s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide
Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when
she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by
which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest
sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore,
that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving
away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the
easier. The tiny number of people who henceforth
knew of Ariana’s existence could be counted upon
to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who
deflected awkward questions with the answer their
mother had taught them: “My sister is too frail for
school.”
Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts— the
Prizes and the Pretense.
Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him
worse. He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy
family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to go to
Godric’s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him;
218
The Bribe
he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both
lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to
ask Ron’s and Hermione’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed
around the kitchen.
For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about
Kreacher. His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back
into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass
of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside
his chair. He hurried to his feat as Kreacher disentangled himself
and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, “Kreacher has returned with
the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.”
Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione,
however, was too quick for him.
“Expelliarmus!”
Mundungus’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught
it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby–tackled
him, and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch.
“What?” he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself
from Ron’s grip. “Wha’ve I done? Setting a bleedin’ ’ouse-elf on
me, what are you playing at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go,
or— ”
“You’re not in much of a position to make threats,” said Harry.
He threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides,
and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched
as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus’s nose.
Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair was
matted and his robes stained.
“Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Mas219
Chapter 11
ter,” croaked the elf. “Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has
many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.”
“You’ve done really well, Kreacher,” said Harry, and the elf
bowed low.
“Right, we’ve got a few questions for you,” Harry told Mundungus, who shouted at once.
“I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense,
mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an’ that was bleedin’
You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there,
I said all along I didn’t wanna do it— ”
“For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,”
said Hermione.
“Well, you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ’eroes then, aren’t you, but I
never pretended I was up for killing myself— ”
“We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-eye,” said
Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy,
bloodshot eyes. “We already knew you were an unreliable bit of
scum.”
“Well then, why the ’ell am I being ’unted down by ’ouse-elves?
Or is this about them goblet again? I ain’t got none of ’em left, or
you could ’ave ’em— ”
“It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting
warmer,” said Harry. “Shut up and listen.”
It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he
could demand some small portion of truth. Harry’s wand was now
so close to the bridge of Mundungus’s nose that Mundungus had
gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view.
“When you cleaned out his house of anything valuable,” Harry
220
The Bribe
began, but Mundungus interrupted him again.
“Sirius never cared about any of the junk— ”
There was the sound of pattering feet, a blaze of shining copper,
an echoing clang, and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run
at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan.
“Call ’im off, call ’im off, ’e should be locked up!” screamed
Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan
again.
“Kreacher, no!” shouted Harry.
Kreacher’s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still
held aloft.
“Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?”
Ron laughed.
“We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading,
you can do the honors,” said Harry.
“Thank you very much, Master,” said Kreacher with a bow,
and he retreated a short distance, his great pale eyes still fixed
upon Mundungus with loathing.
“When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could
find,” Harry began again, “you took a bunch of stuff from the
kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.” Harry’s mouth was
suddenly dry. He could sense Ron and Hermione’s tensions and
excitement too. “What did you do with it?”
“Why?” asked Mundungus, “Is it valuable?”
“You’ve still got it!” cried Hermione.
“No, he hasn’t,” said Ron shrewdly. “He’s wondering whether
he should have asked more money for it.”
“More?” said Mundungus, “that wouldn’t have been effing
difficult . . . bleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I? No choice.”
221
Chapter 11
“What do you mean?”
“I was selling in Diagon Alley, and she come up to me and asks
if I’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin’ snoop.
She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an’ told
me she’d take it and let me off this time, and to fink meself lucky.”
“Who was this woman?” asked Harry.
“I dunno, some Ministry hag.”
Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled.
“Little woman. Bow on top of her head.”
He frowned, then added, “Looked like a toad.”
Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and
shot red sparks into his eyebrows, which ignited.
“Aguamenti!” screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed
from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus.
Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron’s and
Hermione’s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed
to be tingling again.
222
Chapter 12
Magic is Might
A
s August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the
middle of Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until
it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number
twelves were never seen by anybody in the surrounding houses, and nor was the number twelve itself. The Muggles
who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to
sit beside number thirteen.
And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who
seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed
without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no
other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railing
facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the
two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days running,
although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing.
Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric
dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them
might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear such long
223
Chapter 12
cloaks in the heat.
The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their
vigil. Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they
had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking
disappointed.
On the first day of September there were more people lurking in
the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood
silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen,
but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As
evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain,
for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable
moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting.
The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion,
a podgy pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had
relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated
and disappointed.
Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the
hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the
top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death
Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed
elbow. Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off
the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along
the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a
stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand.
The usual low whisper of “Severus Snape” greeted him, the chill
wind swept him, and his tongue rolled up for a moment.
“I didn’t kill you,” he said, once it had unrolled, then held his
breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was
halfway down the stairs into the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs.
Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, “I’ve got news,
224
Magic is Might
and you won’t like it.”
The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now
shone; copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow;
the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid
for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which
a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was
more dramatically different than the house-elf who now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as
clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus’s locket bouncing on his
thin chest.
“Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,” croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and
slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number of
old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered.
“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand,
drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now
they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the
newspaper on top of their scattered parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man
stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED
AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and
began to read the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the
225
Chapter 12
ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle
Studies teacher, Alecto Carrows will will take over the post while
her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark
Arts professor.
“‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values— ’ Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s
study—Merlin’s pants!” she shrieked, making both Harry and
Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room
shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!”
“‘Merlin’s pants’?” repeated Ron, looking amused. “She must
be upset.” He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the
article about Snape.
“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and
Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are
these Carrows?”
“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside.
They were at the top off the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore,
so it’s all friends together. And,” Harry went on bitterly, drawing
up a chair, “I can’t see that the other teachers have got any choice
but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it’ll
be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in
Azkaban— and that’s if they’re lucky. I reckon they’ll stay to try
and protect the students.”
Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his
hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between
his teeth as he did so.
“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so
as not to have to look at Snape’s face. “Well, at least we know
226

exactly where Snape is now.”
He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of
Kreacher’s cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had
been given Regulus’s locket: Today’s French onion was as good as
Harry had ever tasted.
“There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,”
he told Ron as he ate, “more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping
we’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the
Hogwarts Express.”
Ron glanced at his watch.
“I’ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours
ago. Weird, not being on it, isn’t it?”
In his mind’s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine
as he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between
fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny,
Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps
wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how
best to undermine Snape’s new regime.
“They nearly saw me coming back in just now,” Harry said. “I
landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.”
“I do that every time. Oh, here she is,” Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen.
“And what in the name of Merlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that
about?”
“I remembered this,” Hermione panted.
She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered
to the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen
sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside,
and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the
tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much else,
227
Chapter 12
into the bag’s capricious depths.
“Phineas Nigellus,” Hermione explained as she threw the bag
onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.
“Sorry?” said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image
of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in
Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no
doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore’s
collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere,
the sword of Gryffindor.
“Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for
him,” Hermione explained to Ron as he resumed her seat. “But let
him try now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside
of my handbag.”
“Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed.
“Thank you,” smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her.
“So, Harry, what else happened today?”
“Nothing,” said Harry. “Watched the Ministry entrance for
seven house. No sign of her. Saw you dad, though, Ron. He looks
fine.”
Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that
it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley
while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always
surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring
to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained
and anxious.
“Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network
to get to work,” Ron said. “That’s why we haven’t seen Umbridge,
she’d never walk, she’d think she’s too important.”
228
Magic is Might
“And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard
in the navy robes?” Hermione asked.
“Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,” said Ron.
“How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?” Hermione asked, her soup spoon suspended in midair.
“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue
robes.”
“But you never told us that!”
Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf
of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when
Harry had entered the kitchen.
“There’s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!” she
said, flipping feverishly through the pages.
“Well, does it really matter?”
“Ron, it all matters! If we’re going to get into the Ministry and
not give ourselves away when they’re bound to be on the lookout
for intruders, every little detail matters! We’ve been over and over
this, I mean, what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if
you aren’t even bothering to tell us— ”
“Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing— ”
“You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the
Ministry of— ”
“I think we should do it tomorrow,” said Harry.
Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little
over his soup.
“Tomorrow?” repeated Hermione. “You aren’t serious, Harry?’
“I am,” said Harry. “I don’t think we’re going to be much better
prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry
entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther
229
Chapter 12
away that locket could be. There’s already a good chance Umbridge
has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t open.”
“Unless,” said Ron, “she’s found a way of opening it and she’s
now possessed,”
“Wouldn’t make any difference to her, sh e was so evil in the
first place,” Harry shrugged.
Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought.
“We know everything important,” Harry went on, addressing
Hermione. “We know they’ve stopped Apparition in and out of
the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are
allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because
Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And
we know roughly where Umbridge’s office is, because of what you
heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate— ”
“‘I’ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,’” Hermione
recited immediately.
“Exactly,” said Harry. “And we know you get in using those
funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are because I saw that
witch borrowing one from her friend— ”
“But we haven’t got any!”
“If the plan works, we will have,” Harry continued calmly.
“I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know. . . . There are an awful lot
of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance. . . .”
“That’ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,” said Harry. “It’s time to act.”
He could tell from Ron’s and Hermione’s faces that they were
scared, he was not particularly confident himself, and yet he was
sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.
They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to
don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the
230
Magic is Might
Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since
childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in,
eavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied on upon to appear, alone,
at the same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance
to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebody’s briefcase. Slowly they
had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of
Hermione.
“All right,” said Ron slowly, “let’s say we go for it tomorrow. . . . I think it should just be me and Harry.”
“Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed Hermione. “I thought we’d
settled this.”
“It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak,
but this is different, Hermione.” Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of
the Daily Prophet dared ten days previously. “You’re on the list
of Muggle-borns who didn’t present themselves for interrogation!”
“And you’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow!
If anyone shouldn’t go, it’s Harry, he’s got a ten-thousand-Galleon
price on his head— ”
“Fine, I’ll stay here,” said Harry. “Let me know if you ever
defeat Voldemort, won’t you?”
As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on
Harry’s forehead. His hand jumped to it: He saw Hermione’s eyes
narrow; and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair
out of his eyes.
“Well, if all three of us go we’ll have to Disapparate separately,”
Ron was saying. “We can’t all fit under the Cloak anymore.”
Harry’s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood
up. At once, Kreacher hurried forward.
“Master has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the sa231
Chapter 12
vory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?”
“Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute—er—bathroom.”
Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry
hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing,
where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again.
Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps
in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes. . . .
He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either
side of him had high, timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread
houses.
He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own
long-fingered hand against the door. He felt a mounting excitement. . . .
The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell
as she looked into Harry’s face, humor gone, terror replacing it. . . .
“Gregorovitch?” said a high, cold voice.
She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white
hand held it steady, prevented her shutting him out. . . .
“I want Gregorovitch.”
“Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!” she cried, shaking her head. “He
no live here! He no live here! I know him not!”
Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back
away down the dark hall, and Harry followed gliding toward her,
and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand.
“Where is he?”
“Das welfs ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!”
He raised the wand. She screamed. Two young children came
running into the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms.
There was a flash of green light—
232
Magic is Might
“Harry! HARRY!”
He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was
pounding on the door again.
“Harry, open up!”
He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the
door; Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and
looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking
unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly
bathroom.
“What were you doing?” asked Hermione sternly.
“What d’you think I was doing?” asked Harry with feeble
bravado.
“You were yelling your head off?” said Ron.
“Oh yeah . . . I must’ve dozed off or— ”
“Harry, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said Hermione,
taking deep breaths. “We know your scar hurt downstairs, and
you’re white as a sheet.”
Harry sat down on the edge of the bath.
“Fine, I’ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now
he’s probably killed her whole family. And he didn’t need to. It
was Cedric all over again, they were just there. . . .”
“Harry, you aren’t supposed to let this happen anymore!” Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. “Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! He thought the connection
was dangerous—Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to
watch him kill and torture, how can it help?”
“Because it means I know what he’s doing,” said Harry.
“So you’re not even going to try to shut him out?”
“Hermione, I can’t. You know I’m lousy at Occlumency, I never
got the hang of it.”
233
Chapter 12
“You never really tried!” she said hotly. “I don’t get it, Harry—
do you like having this special connection or relationship or what—
whatever— ”
She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up.
“Like it?” he said quietly. “Would you like it?”
“I—no— I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean— ”
“I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have
to watch him when he’s most dangerous. But I’m going to use it.”
“Dumbledore— ”
“Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else’s. I want
to know why he’s after Gregorovitch.”
“Who?”
“He’s a foreign wandmaker,” said Harry. “He made Krum’s
wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.”
“But according to you,” said Ron, “Voldemort’s got Ollivander
locked up somewhere. If he’s already got a wandmaker, what does
he need another one for?”
“Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch
is better . . . or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain
what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander
didn’t know.”
Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and
Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back.
“Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,” said Hermione, “but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not
to take responsibility for your own power?”
“Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!”
They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments,
234
Magic is Might
against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemort’s mind. To his relief, Ron
intervened.
“Drop it,” he advised her. “It’s up to him. And if we’re going
to the ministry tomorrow, don’t you reckon we should go over the
plan?”
Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter
rest, though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the
first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement
kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart.
They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending
hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word
perfect, to each other. Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius’s
room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph
of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan
to himself for another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand,
however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles,
or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain
hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly.
Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.
“You look terrible,” was Ron’s greeting as he entered the room
to wake Harry.
“Not for long,” said Harry, yawning.
They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being
served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly
manic expression that Harry associated with exam review.
“Robes,” she said under her breath, acknowledging her presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in
her beaded bag, “Polyjuice potion . . . Invisibility Cloak . . . Decoy
235
Chapter 12
Detonators . . . You should each take a couple just in case. . . . Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable Ears . . . ”
They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs,
Kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a steak-andkidney pie ready for them when they returned.
“Bless him,” said Ron fondly, “and when you think I used to
fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.”
They made their way onto the front step with immense caution.
They could see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the
house from across the misty square.
Hermione disapparated with Ron first, then came back for
Harry.
After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation,
Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of
their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted,
except for a couple of large bins; the first ministry workers did not
usually appear here until at least eight o’clock.
“Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch. “She ought
to be here in about five minutes. When I’ve Stunned her— ”
“Hermione, we know,” said Ron sternly. “And I thought we
were supposed to open the door before she got here?”
Hermione squealed.
“I nearly forgot! Stand back— ”
She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied
fire door beside them, which burst open with a crash. The dark
corridor behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting
trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward
her, to make it look as though it was still closed.
“And now,” she said, turning back to face the other two in the
alley way, “we put on the Cloak again— ”
236
Magic is Might
“— and we wait,” Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione’s
head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry.
Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a
little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from
them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness: the sun had just
come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the
unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione’s silent Stunning
Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.
“Nicely done, Hermione,” said Ron, emerging from behind a bin
beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak.
Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway
that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch’s
head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had
taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little
witch’s handbag.
“She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that
identified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic
Office. “You’d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens,”
He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the
letters M.O.M., which he had taken from the witch’s purse.
Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant
heliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double
of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put
them on, Harry checked his watch.
“Were running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any
second.”
They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and
Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione
remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop,
237
Chapter 12
and a small, ferrety-looking wizard appeared before them.
“Oh, hello, Mafalda.”
“Hello!” said Hermione in a quavery voice. “How are you today?”
“Not so good, actually,” replied the little wizard, who looked
thoroughly downcast.
As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry
and Ron crept along behind them.
“I’m sorry to hear you’re under the heather,” said Hermione,
talking firmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon
his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street.
“Here, have a sweet.”
“Eh? Oh, no thanks— ”
“I insist!” said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of
pastilles I his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took
one.
The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched
his tongue, the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did
not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the
top of his head.
“Oh dear!” she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. “Perhaps you’d better take the day off!”
“No—no!” He choked and retched, trying to continue on his
way despite being unable to walk straight. “I must— today—must
go— ”
“But that’s just silly!” said Hermione, alarmed. “You can’t go
to work in this state— I think you ought to go to St. Mungo’s and
get them to sort you out!”
The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying
to crawl toward the main street.
238
Magic is Might
“You simply can’t go to work like this!” cried Hermione.
At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a
repulsed Hermione to claw his away back into a standing positions,
he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the
bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying
chunks of vomit.
“Urgh,” said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her robe to
avoid the puddles of sick. “It would have made much less mess to
Stun him too.”
“Yeah,” said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the
wizard’s bag, “but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies
would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn’t
he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.”
Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had
been folded in his bag.
“Weird he wasn’t wearing them today, wasn’t it, seeing how
much he wanted to go? Anyway, I’m Reg Cattermole, according
to the label in the back.”
“Now wait here,” Hermione told Harry, who was still under the
Invisibility Cloak, “and we’ll be back with some hairs for you.”
He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry,
skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared.
“We don’t know who he is,” Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he’s pretty tall, you’ll need bigger robes. . . .”
She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered
for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change.
239
Chapter 12
Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than
six feet tall, and from what he could tell from his well-muscled
arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the
other two.
“Blimey, that’s scary,” said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now
towered over them.
“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” Hermione told Harry, “and let’s
go, it’s nearly nine.”
They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along
the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two
flights of steps, one labeled Gentlemen, the other Ladies.
“See you in a moment, then,” said Hermione nervously, and
she tottered off down the steps to Ladies. Harry and Ron joined
a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to
be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and
white.
“Morning, Reg!” called another wizard in navy blue robes as
he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a
slot in the door. “Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us
all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up,
Harry Potter?”
The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a
forced chuckle.
“Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?”
And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.
To Harry’s left and right came the sound of flushing. He
crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the
cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the
toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.
240
Magic is Might
“We have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered.
“Looks like it,” Harry whispered back; he voice came out deep
and gravelly.
They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet.
He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though
he appeared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes
remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next
moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out a fireplace
into the Ministry of Magic.
He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he
was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry
remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of
the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden
floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the
scene. It was rather frightening, this was sculpture of a witch and
a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the
Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved
in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words magic
is might.
Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another
wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him.
“Out of the way, can’t y— oh, sorry, Runcorn!”
Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man whom Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating.
“Psst!” said a voice, and he looked around to see a wispy little
witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing
to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them.
“You got in all right, then?” Hermione whispered to Harry.
241
Chapter 12
“No, he’s still stuck in the bog,” said Ron.
“Oh, very funny . . . It’s horrible, isn’t it?” she said to Harry,
who was staring up at the statue. “Have you seen what they’re
sitting on?”
Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had though
were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved
human: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and
children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed
together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards.
“Muggles,” whispered Hermione. “In their rightful place. Come
on, let’s get going.”
They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward
the golden gates at the end of the hall looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure
of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a
smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden
grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest
one when a voice said, “Cattermole!”
They looked around: Harry’s stomach turned over. One of the
Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore’s death was striding
toward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their
eyes downcast. Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The
man’s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his
magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much
gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored them.
“I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out
my office, Cattermole. It’s still raining in there.”
Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke.
242
Magic is Might
“Raining . . . in your office? That’s— that’s not good, is it?”
Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley’s eyes widened.
“You think it’s funny, Cattermole, do you?”
A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the list and
bustled off.
“No,” said Ron, “no, of course— ”
“You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate
your wife, Cattermole. In fact, I’m quite surprised you’re not down
there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a
bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood
next time.”
Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked
at her. She coughed feebly and turned away.
“I— I— ” stammered Ron.
“But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, “—not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken
for such filth— and the Head of the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to
do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?”
“Yes,” whispered Ron.
“Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an hour, you wife’s Blood Status will be in even
graver doubt than it is now.”
The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod an unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate
this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another
lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with
a clang and the lift began to move upward.
“What am I going to do?” Ron asked the other two at once;
243
Chapter 12
he looked stricken. “If I don’t turn up, my wife . . . I mean, Cattermole’s wife— ”
“We’ll come with you, we should stick together— ” began Harry,
but Ron shook his head feverishly.
“That’s mental, we haven’t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I’ll go and sort out Yaxley’s office—but how do I stop it
raining?”
“Try Finite Incantatem,” said Hermione at once, “that should
stop the rain if it’s a hex or curse; if it doesn’t, something’s
gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his
belongings— ”
“Say it again, slowly— ” said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt.
A disembodied female voice said, “Level four, Department for the
Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast,
Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liason Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,” and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple
of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered
around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.
“Morning, Albert,” said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at
Harry. He glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more: Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions
to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttered,
“Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert, I’m
pretty confident I’ll get his job now!”
He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice.
The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more.
“Level two, Department of Magical law enforcement, including
the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wiz244
Magic is Might
engamot Administration Services,” said the disembodied witch’s
voice.
Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out
of the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione
said, very fast, “Actually, Harry, I think I’d better go after him,
I don’t think he knows what he’s doing and if he gets caught the
whole thing— ”
“Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.”
The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four
people stood before them, two of them in deep conversation: a
long-haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold,
and a squat, toad-like witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair
and clutching a clipboard to her chest.

A
h, Mafalda!” said Umbridge, looking at Hermione.
“Travers sent you, did he?”
“Y—yes,” squeaked Hermione.
“Good, you’ll do perfectly well.” Umbridge spoke to
the wizard in black and gold. “That’s that problem solved, Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we shall be able
to start straightaway.” She consulted her clipboard. “Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee!! Tut,
tut . . . even here, in the heart of the Ministry!” She stepped into
the lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been
listening to Umbridge’s conversation with the Minister. “We’ll go
straight down, Mafalda, and you’ll find everything you need in the
courtroom.
“Good morning, Albert, aren’t you getting out?”
“Yes, of course,” said Harry in Runcorn’s deep voice.
Harry stepped out of the lift. The golden grilles clanged shut
246
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
behind him. Glancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione’s
anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side
of her, Umbridge’s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder.
“What brings you up here, Runcorn?” asked the new Minister
of Magic. His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes,
putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock.
“Needed a quick word with,” Harry hesitated for a fraction of
a second, “Arthur Weasley. Someone said he was up on level one.”
“Ah,” said Pius Thickness. “Has he been caught having contact
with an Undesirable?”
“No,” said Harry, his throat dry. “No, nothing like that.”
“Ah, well. It’s only a matter of time,” said Thicknesse. “If you
ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day,
Runcorn.”
“Good day, Minister.”
Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment the Minister had passed out of sight,
Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy black
cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the
opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to
stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden.
Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming
wooden door after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small
plaque with the owner’s name and occupation upon it, the might
of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force
itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting
with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably
childish. They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside
without being detected. They had not given a moment’s thought
247
Chapter 13
to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly
last hours; Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was
beyond him, a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome;
and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he
knew perfectly well that has quarry had just gone down in the lift.
He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide
what to do. The silence pressed upon him: There was no bustling
or talk or swift footsteps here; the purple-carpeted corridors were
as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the
place.
Her office must be up here, Harry thought.
It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry
in her office, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it
to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, passing
nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to
a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment.
Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned
a corner. Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide
open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small
desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished
and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect
was quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their
wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every
direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized
that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all
formed the same pattern, and after a few more seconds he realized
that what he was watching was the creation of pamphlets— that
the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and
248
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard.
Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what
they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled
footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a
young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its
pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title:
MUDBLOODS
and the Dangers They Pose to
a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society
Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering
face in the middle of its petals, being strangled by a green weed
with fangs and a scowl. There was no author’s name upon the
pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed
to tingle as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him
confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her
wand, “Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does
anyone know?”
“Careful,” said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor.
“What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?”
The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the
space full of pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and rage reared
in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole on
a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had
been set into the wood— an eye that was shockingly familiar to
anybody who had known Alastor Moody.
For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he
was doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible. He strode
249
Chapter 13
straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving:
It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read:
Dolores Umbridge
Senior Undersecretary to the Minister
Below that, a slightly shinier new plaque read:
Head of the Muggle-born
Registration Commission
Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they
were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they
would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front
of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body.
Crouching down beneath the cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator
on the ground.
It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and
wizards in front of him. A few moments later, during which Harry
waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a long band
and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner. The
young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere
as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the source
of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge’s office, and closed the door behind him.
He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like
Umbridge’s office at Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies, and dried
flowers covered every available surface. The walls bore the same
ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with a sickening cuteness. The desk
250
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
was covered with a flouncy, flowered cloth. Behind Mad-Eye’s eye,
a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers
on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it and
saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole
behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his
pocket. Then he turned to face the room again, raised his wand,
and murmured, “Accio Locket.”
Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt
Umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open drawers. He
saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips
that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back;
a sloppy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no
sign of a locket.
There was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to searching it. Like Filch’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders,
each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his
search: Mr. Weasley’s file.
He pulled it out and opened it.
Arthur Weasley
Blood Status Pureblood, but with unacceptable proMuggle leanings. Known member of the
Order of the Phoenix
251
Chapter 13
Family: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two
youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son
currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry
inspectors have confirmed.
Security Status: TRACKED. All movements are being
monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable
No. 1 will contact (has stayed with
Weasley family previously)
“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath
as he replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had
an idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened
up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places, he saw a
poster of himself on the wall, with the words Undesirable No.
1 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it
with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to
read it and saw that Umbridge had written, “To be punished.”
Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the
vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that
the locket was not there. He gave the office one last sweeping look
and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from
a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the
desk.
Harry crossed the room and snatched it up, but realized the
moment he touched it that it was not am mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book,
Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across
his hat—The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore —nor the slightly
252
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
smaller writing across his chest: “by Rita skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?”
Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their
arms around each other’s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbowlength hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one
on Krum’s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared
in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look
about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry
wondered whether it was a young doge, but before he could check
the caption, the door of the office opened.
If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility cloak
over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have caught
a glimpse of movement because for a moment or two he remained
quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just
vanished. Perhaps deciding that all he had seen was Dumbledore
scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily
replaced it upon the shelf. Thicknesse finally walked to the desk
and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It
sprang out and begun scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly,
hardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the
open area beyond.
The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of
the Decoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked.
Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet
it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless,
remember that poisonous duck?”
Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It
had never been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and
253
Chapter 13
there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge
while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to
be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again
another day. The first thing to do was to find Ron, and then they
could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom.
The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in a pulled
off the Invisibility Cloak as it started its descent. To his enormous
relief, when it rattle to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wildeyed Ron got in.
“M-morning,” he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again.
“Ron, it’s me, Harry!”
“Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like—why isn’t Hermione with you?”
“She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she
couldn’t refuse, and— ”
But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again. The
doors opened and Mr. Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly
witch whose blonde hair was teased so high that it resembled an
anthill.
“ . . . I quite understand what you’re saying, Wakanda, but I’m
afraid I cannot be part to— ”
Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very
strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at him with that much dislike.
The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once
more.
“Oh, hello, Reg,” said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the
sound of steady dripping from Ron’s robes. “Isn’t your wife in for
questioning today? Er—what’s happened to you? Why are you
so wet?”
“Yaxley’s office is raining,” said Ron. He addressed Mr.
254
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
Weasley’s shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his
father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other’s
eyes. “I couldn’t stop it, so they’ve sent me to get Bernie—
Pillsworth, I think they said— ”
“Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said Mr. Weasley.
“Did you try Meterolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.”
“Meterolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron. “No, I didn’t.
Thanks, D— I mean, thanks, Arthur.”
The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left,
and Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him,
but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift,
his nose buried in some papers he was reading.
Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize
he was in a lift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley,
turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened
again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time
found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm.
“One moment, Runcorn.”
The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor,
Mr. Weasley said, “I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.”
Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley’s anger was no less
because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was
to act stupid.
“Sorry?” he said.
“Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley fiercely. “You
down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn’t you?”
“I— so what if I did?” said Harry.
“So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,” said Mr.
Weasley quietly, as the lift sank ever lower. “And if he survives
255
Chapter 13
Azkaban, you’ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his
sons, and his friends— ”
“Arthur,” Harry interrupted, “you know you’re being tracked,
don’t you?”
“Is that a threat, Runcorn?” said Mr. Weasley loudly.
“No,” said Harry, “it’s a fact! They’re watching your every
move— ”
The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr.
Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift. Harry
stood there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody
other than Runcorn. . . . the lift doors clanged shut.
Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He
would try to extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing
with the raining office. When the doors opened, he stepped out
into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the woodpaneled and carpeted corridors above. As the lift rattled away
again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black
door that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries.
He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway
he remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight
of stairs down to the court chambers. His mind grappled with
possibilities as he crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy
Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on
the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word
with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was
sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed
it, Hermione’s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they
were clear of the Ministry. . . .
Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural
chill that was creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog.
256
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took: a cold
that reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs. And
then he felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling
him, expanding inside him. . . .
Dementors, he thought.
As he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he
saw a dreadful scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms
was packed with tall, black-hooded figures, their faces completely
hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The
petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and
shivering on hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their
faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield
themselves from the dementors’ greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding
up an down in front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness,
and the despair of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a
curse. . . .
Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure
a Patronus here without revealing himself instantly. So he moved
forward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think
of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him.
Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The
eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and
he felt sure that they sense him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence
that still had some hope, some resilience. . . .
And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one
of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and
screams echoed out of it.
“No, no, I’m a half-blood, I’m a half-blood, I tell you! My
257
Chapter 13
father was a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he’s a
well-known broomstick designer, look him up, I tell you— get your
hands off me, get your hands off— ”
“This is your final warning,” said Umbridge’s soft voice, magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man’s desperate
screams. “If you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor’s
Kiss.”
The man’s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the
corridor.
“Take him away,” said Umbridge.
Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their
rotting, scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who
appeared to be fainting. They glided away down the corridor with
him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him
from sight.
“Next—Mary Cattermole,” called Umbridge.
A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot.
Her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long,
plain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed the
dementors, Harry saw her shudder.
He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he
hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door
began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her.
It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic. This one was much smaller,
though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic
sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well.
There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura
over the place; they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners
farthest from the high raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade,
258
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite
as white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the
platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up and down, up
and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to
protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the
dementors: That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers.
“Sit down,” said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice.
Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of
the floor beneath the raised platform. The moment she had sat
down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her
there.
“You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked Umbridge.
Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod.
“Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance
Department?”
Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears.
“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!”
Umbridge ignored her.
“Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?”
Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever.
“They’re frightened, they think I might not come home— ”
“Spare us,” spat Yaxley. “The brats of Mudbloods do not stir
our sympathies.”
Mrs. Cattermole’s sobs masked Harry’s footsteps as he made
his way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus
cat patrolled, he felt the change in temperature: It was warm and
comfortable here. The Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridge’s, and
it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in her element,
upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. Slowly, and
259
Chapter 13
very carefully, he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He
was worried about making Hermione jump. He thought of casting
the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge
raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his
chance.
“I’m behind you,” he whispered into Hermione’s ear.
As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed.
“A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry
today, Mrs. Cattermole,” Umbridge was saying, “Eight-and-threequarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that
description?”
Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve.
“Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took
that wand?”
“T— took?” sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. “I didn’t t-take it from
anybody. I b-bought it when I was eleven years old. It—it—it—
chose me.”
She cried harder than ever.
Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want
to attack her. She leaned forward over the barrier, the better to
observe her victim, and something gold swung forward too, and
dangled over the void: the locket.
Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge
and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything
else.
260
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
“No,” said Umbridge, “no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole.
Wands only choose witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have
your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here—
Mafalda, pass them to me.”
Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that
moment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between
the stubby fingers. Hermione’s hands were shaking with shock. She
fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her,
finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole’s
name o nit.
“That’s— that’s pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge’s blouse.
“What?” snapped Umbridge, glancing down. “Oh yes— an old
family heirloom,” she said, patting the locket lying on her large
bosom. “The S stands for Selwyn. . . . I am related to the Selwyns. . . . Indeed, there are few pure blood families to whom I am
not related. . . . A pity,” she continued in a louder voice, flicking
through Mrs. Cattermole’s questionnaire, “that the same cannot
be said for you. ‘Parents professions: greengrocers.’”
Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled
up and down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners.
It was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into
Harry’s brain and obliterated his sense of caution— that the locket
she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to
holster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not
even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak,
and said, “Stupefy!”
There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her
forehead hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole’s papers
slid off her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling silver
261
Chapter 13
cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw
Harry’s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to
draw his own wand, but too late: “Stupefy!”
Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the flood.
“Harry!”
“Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her
pretend— ”
“Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!”
Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak: down
below, the dementors had moved out of their corners: they were
gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because
the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned
restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a
slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back.
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry’s wand and leaped
toward the dementors, which fell back and melted into the dark
shadows again. The stag’s light, more powerful and more warming
than the cat’s protection, filed the whole dungeon as it cantered
around and around the room.
“Get the Horcrux,” Harry told Hermione.
He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak back
into his bag, and approached Mrs. Cattermole.
“You?” she whispered, gazing into his face. “But—but Reg
said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning!”
“Did I?” muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her
arms.
“Well, I’ve had a change of heart. Diffindo!” Nothing hap262
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
pened. “Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains?”
“Wait, I’m trying something up here— ”
“Hermione, we’re surrounded by dementors!”
“I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket’s
gone— I need to replicate it—Geminio! There . . . That should
fool her. . . .”
Hermione came running downstairs.
“Let’s see. . . . Relashio!”
The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair.
Mrs. Cattermole looked just as frightened as before.
“I don’t understand,” she whispered.
“You’re going to leave here with us,” said Harry, pulling her to
her feet. “Go home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the
country if you’ve got to. Disguise yourselves and run. You’ve seen
how it is, you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here.”
“Harry,” said Hermione, “how are we going to get out of here
with all those dementors outside the door?”
“Patronuses,” said Harry, pointing his wand at his own: The
stag slowed and walked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door.
“As many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione.”
“Expec—Expecto patronum,” said Hermione. Nothing happened.
“It’s the only spell she ever has trouble with,” Harry told
a completely bemused Mrs. Cattermole. “Bit unfortunate,
really . . . Come on, Hermione. . . .”
“Expecto patronum!”
A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione’s wand and swam
gracefully through the air to join the stag.
“C’mon,” said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door.
263
Chapter 13
When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries
of shock from the people waiting outside. Harry looked around: the
dementors were falling back on both sides of them, melding into
the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures.
“It’s been decided that you should all go home and go into
hiding with your families.” Harry told the waiting Muggle-borns,
who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering
slightly. “Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the
Ministry. That’s the—er—new official position. Now, if you’ll just
follow the Patronuses, you’ll be able to leave from the Atrium.”
They managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted, but as they approached the lifts Harry started to have
misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an
otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them
accused Muggleborns, he could not help feeling that they would
attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome
conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them.
“Reg!” screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into
Ron’s arms. “Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he’s told all of us to leave the country, I think we’d better
do it, Reg, I really do, let’s hurry home and fetch the children
and—why are you so wet?”
“Water,” muttered Ron, disengaging himself. “Harry, they
know there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a
hole in Umbridge’s office door. I reckon we’ve got five minutes of
that— ”
Hermione’s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror
struck face to Harry.
“Harry, if we’re trapped here—!”
“We won’t be if we move fast,” said Harry. He addressed the
264
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
silent group behind them, who were all gawping at him.
“Who’s got wands?”
About half of them raised their hands.
“Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself
to someone who has. We’ll need to be fast before they stop us.
Come on.”
They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry’s Patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the
lifts began to rise.
“Level eight,” said the cool witch’s voice, “Atrium.”
Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was
full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off.
“Harry!” squeaked Hermione. “What are we going to—?”
“STOP!” Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn
echoed through the Atrium: The wizards sealing the fireplaces
froze. “Follow me,” he whispered to the group of terrified Muggleborns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and
Hermione.
“What’s up, Albert?” said the same balding wizard who had
followed Harry out of the fireplace earlier. He looked nervous.
“This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,” said Harry
with all the authority he could muster.
The group of wizard sin front of him looked at one another.
“We’ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone— ”
“Are you contradicting me?” Harry blustered. “Would you like
me to have you family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell’s?”
“Sorry!” gasped the balding wizard, backing away. “I didn’t
mean nothing, Albert, but I thought . . . I thought they were in for
questioning and . . . ”
“Their blood is pure,” said Harry, and his deep voice echoed
265
Chapter 13
impressively through the hall. “Purer than many of yours. I daresay. Off you go,” he boomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried
forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and
resentful. Then:
“Mary!”
Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting but pale and wan, and just come running
out of a lift.
“R–Reg?”
She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.
The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from
one Reg Cattermole to the other.
“Hey—what’s going on? What is this?”
“Seal the exit! SEAL IT!”
Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward
the group beside the fireplaces into which all of the Muggle-borns
but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard
lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him,
sending him flying through the air.
“He’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!” Harry
shouted.
The balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of
which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open
fireplace, and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry
to the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed,
“My Wife! Who was that with my wife? What’s going on?”
Harry saw Yaxley’s head turn, saw an inkling of truth dawn in
that brutish face.
“Come on!” Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand
266
The Muggle-born Registration Commission
and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed
over Harry’s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting
up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door: Ron
was standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole.
“Reg, I don’t understand— ”
“Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home!”
There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked
around: Yaxley had just appeared.
“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand
and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot.
Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing hands, but something was wrong. . . . Hermione’s hand seemed
to be sliding out of his grip. . . .
He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not
breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were Ron’s
arm and Hermione’s fingers, which were slowly slipping away. . . .
And then he saw the door of number twelve, Grimmauld Place,
with its serpent door knocker, but before he could draw breath,
there was a scream and a flash of purple light. Hermione’s hand
was suddenly vicelike upon his hand and everything went dark
again.
267
Chapter 14
The Thief
H
arry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and
green: he had no idea what had happened, he only
knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves
and twigs. Struggling to draw breath into lungs that
felt flattened, he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was
sunlight streaming though a canopy of leaves far above him. Then
an object twitched close to his face. He pushed himself onto his
hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce creature, but saw
that the object was Ron’s foot. Looking around, Harry saw that
they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone.
Harry’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forrest, and for a
moment, even though eh knew how foolish and dangerous it would
be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leaped
at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid’s hut. However, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and
Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not
the Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, they were more
widely spaced, the ground clearer.
268
The Thief
He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron’s head.
The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry’s
mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron’s left side and his
face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The
Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between
Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and
redder as his face drained of the little color it had left.
“What’s happened to him?”
“Splinched,” said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron’s
sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest.
Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron’s shirt. He had
always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this . . . His
insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron’s upper
arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly
away as though by a knife.
“Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled
‘Essence of Dittany’— ”
“Bag— right—’
Harry sped tot he place where Hermione had landed, seized
the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object
after object began presenting itself to his touch: He felt the leather
spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes—
“Quickly!”
“He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the
depths of the magical bag.
“Accio Dittany!”
A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and
hastened back to Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now halfclosed, strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids.
269
Chapter 14
“He’s fainted,” said Hermione who was also rather pale; she no
longer looked like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places.
“Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.”
Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took
it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound.
Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry
saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several
days old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh.
“Wow,” said Harry.
“It’s all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily. “There are
spells that would put him completely right, but I daren’t try in
case I do them wrong and cause more damage. . . . He’s lost too
much blood already. . . .”
“How did he get hurt? I mean”—Harry shook his head, trying
to clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken place— “why
are we here? I thought were were going back to Grimmauld Place?”
Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears.
“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to go back there.”
“What d’you—?”
“As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn’t
get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when
we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then—well, I think he must
have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he
slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought
us here instead!”
“But then, where’s he? Hang on. . . . You don’t mean he’s at
Grimmauld Place? He can’t get in there?”
Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded.
“Harry, I think he can. I— I forced him to let go with a Revul270
The Thief
sion Jinx, but I’d already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm’s
protection. Since Dumbledore died, we’re Secret-Keepers, so I’ve
given him the secret, haven’t I?”
There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was
a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was
no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing
other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive
though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now
that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home.
With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry
imagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak-and-kidney
pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat.
“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!”
“Don’t be stupid, it wasn’t your fault! If anything, it was
mine. . . .”
Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye’s eye.
Hermione recoiled, looking horrified.
“Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people.
I couldn’t leave it there . . . but that’s how they knew there were
intruders.”
Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his
eyes. He was still gray and his face glistened with sweat.
“How d’you feel?” Hermione whispered.
“Lousy,” croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm.
‘Where are we?”
“In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,” said
Hermione. “I wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this
was— ”
“— the first place you thought of,” Harry finished for her, glanc271
Chapter 14
ing around at the apparently deserted glade. He could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated
to the first place Hermione had thought of—how Death Eaters
had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did
Voldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had
taken them?
“D’you reckon we should move on?” Ron asked Harry, and
Harry could tell by the look on Ron’s face that he was thinking the
same.
“I dunno.”
Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt
to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The
prospect of moving him was daunting.
“Let’s stay here for now,” Harry said..
Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet.
“Where are we going?’ asked Ron.
“If we’re staying, we should put some protective enchantments
around the place,” she replied, and raising her wand, she began to
walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding
air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing.
“Salvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry . . . ”
“Tent?”
“In the bag!”
“In the . . . of course,” said Harry.
He did no bother to grope inside it this time, but used another
Summoning Charm. The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas,
rope, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the smell
272
The Thief
of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of
the Quidditch World Cup.
“I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?”
he asked, starting to disentangle the tent pegs.
“Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad,” said
Hermione, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements
with her wand, “so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto!” she
added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one
fluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto
the ground before Harry, out of whose started hands a tent peg
soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope.
“Cave Imunicium,” Hermione finished with a skyward flourish.
“That’s as much as I can do. At the very least, we should know
they’re coming. I can’t guarantee it will keep our Vol— ”
“Don’t say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice harsh.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other.
“I’m sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to
look at them, “but it feels like a— a jinx or something. Can’t we
call him You-Know-Who—please?”
“Dumbledore said fear of a name— ” began Harry.
“In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by
his name didn’t do Dumbledore much good in the end,” Ron
snapped back. “Just— just show You-Know-Who some respect,
will you?”
“Respect?” Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning
look; apparently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was
in such a weakened condition.
Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the
entrance of the tent. The interior was exactly as Harry remembered
273
Chapter 14
it: a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He
shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the
lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned
Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he
closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while.
“I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the
kitchen.
Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had
been on the night that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away
a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After a minute or two,
Ron broke the silence.
“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?”
“With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort. “As long as Mr. Cattermole had his
wits about him, he’ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by SideAlong-Apparition and they’ll be fleeing the country right now with
their children. That’s what Harry told her to do.”
“Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back on his
pillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color
had returned. “I didn’t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that
quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I
was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in
Azkaban because of us . . . ”
Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had wanted
to ask— about whether Mrs. Cattermole’s lack of a wand would
prevent her Apparating alongside her husband—died in his throat.
Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles,
and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt as
274
The Thief
if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him.
“So, have you got it?” Harry asked her, partly to remind her
that he was there.
“Got— got what?” she said with a little start.
“What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where’s
the locket?”
“You got it?” shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on
his pillow. “No one tells me anything! Blimey, you could have
mentioned it!”
“Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters,
weren’t we?” said Hermione. “Here.”
And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and
handed it to Ron.
It was as large as a chicken’s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid
with many small green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light
shining through the tent’s canvas roof.
“There isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since Kreacher
had it?” asked Ron hopefully. “I mean, are we sure it’s still a
Horcrux?”
“I think so,” said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking
at it closely. “There’d be some sign of damage if it had been
magically destroyed.”
She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The
thing looked perfect, pristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had
been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it.
“I reckon Kreacher’s right,” said Harry. “We’re going to have
to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.”
Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind
275
Chapter 14
the little golden doors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their
efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him.
Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with
his fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open
Regulus’s bedroom door. Neither worked. He handed the locket
back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were
no more successful at opening it than he had been.
“Can you feel it, though?” Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he
held it tight in his clenched fist.
“What d’you mean?”
Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two,
Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood
pulsing through his veins that he could feel, or was it something
beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart?
“What are we going to do with it?” Hermione asked.
“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it.” Harry replied,
and, little though he wanted to, he hung the chain around his own
neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it
rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him.
“I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the
tent,” he added to Hermione, standing up and stretching. “And
we’ll need to think about some food as well. You stay there,” he
added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty
shade of green.
With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione
spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However,
the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day,
and whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle276
The Thief
repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because
people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought
no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione
at ten o’clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the
bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky
visible from their protected clearing.
He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had
not packed any food in her magical bag, as she had assumed that
they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they
had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in
a billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion
away, looking queasy: Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt
Hermione’s feelings.
The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what
sounded like crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were
caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held
tight at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to their
inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease.
He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to
steal back the Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he
sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny
part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though
he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe
even years, but now he had come to an abrupt half, run out of
road.
There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did
not have the faintest idea where they could be. He did not even
277
Chapter 14
know what all of them were. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know
how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that
currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had
not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it
might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry
thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat
ticking irregularly alongside his own.
Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the
dark. He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at
him, relentlessly, Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and
Hermione, now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk
away if they wanted to: He could not. And it seemed to Harry
as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that
the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had
left. . . . Stupid idea, he told himself, don’t think that. . . .
His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid he was
making it happen by having these thoughts, and tried to direct
them into another channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who had
expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the
elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew?
Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward him in
the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what
would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick
images swarmed into Harry’s head and he tried to push these away
too, for these was nothing he could do for Kreacher. He and Hermione had already decided against trying to summon him; what
if someone from the Ministry came too? They could not count on
elfish Apparition from being free of the same flaw that had taken
Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione’s sleeve.
278
The Thief
Harry’s scar was burning now. He thought that there was
so much they did not know: Lupin had been right about magic
they had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn’t Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that there would be time;
that he would live for years, for centuries, perhaps, like his friend
Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong. . . . Snape had seen to
that. . . . Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of
the tower . . .
And Dumbledore had fallen . . . fallen . . .
“Give it to me, Gregorovitch.”
Harry’s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front
of him by a long-fingered white hand. The man at whom he was
pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were
no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound,
his limbs wrapped about him, his terrified face, on a level with
Harry’s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. He
had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard: a trussed-up Father
Christmas.
“I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen
from me!”
“Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows. . . . He
always knows.”
The hanging man’s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they
seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed
Harry whole—
And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout
little Gregorovitch’s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch
burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern
illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold
279
Chapter 14
gleamed in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window
ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair.
In the split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him, Harry
saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a
Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backwards out
of the window with a crow of laughter.
And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnel-like
pupils and Gregorovitch’s face was stricken with terror.
“Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?” said the high cold voice.
“I do not know, I never know, a young man—no—please—
PLEASE!”
A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light—
“Harry!”
He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had
passed out against the side of the tent, had slid sideways down
the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. He looked up at
Hermione, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible
through the dark branches high above them.
“Dream,” he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet
Hermione’s glower with a look of innocence. “Must’ve dozed off,
sorry.”
“I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face!
You were looking into Vol— ”
“Don’t say his name!” came Ron’s angry voice from the depths
of the tent.
“Fine,” retorted Hermione. “You-Know-Who’s mind, then!”
“I didn’t mean it to happen!” Harry said. “It was a dream!
Can you control what you dream about, Hermione?”
“If you just learned to apply Occlumency.
280
The Thief
But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to
discuss what he had just seen.
“He’s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he’s killed
him, but before he killed him he read Gregorovitch’s mind and I
saw— ”
“I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re
falling asleep,” said Hermione coldly.
“I can finish the watch!”
“No, you’re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.”
She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn.
Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside.
Ron’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry
climbed into the one above him, lay down, and looked up at the
dark canvas ceiling. After several minutes, Ron spoke in a voice so
low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance.
“What’s You-Know-Who doing?”
Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail,
then whispered into the darkness.
“He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing
him.”
“How’s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he’s
tied up?”
“I dunno. . . . It’s weird, isn’t it?”
Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all he had seen and heard.
The more he recalled, the less sense it made. . . . Voldemort had said
nothing about Harry’s wand, nothing about the twin cores, nothing
about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat
Harry’s. . . .
“He wanted something from Gregorovitch,” Harry said, eyes
281
Chapter 14
still closed tight. “He asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch
said it had been stolen from him . . . and then . . . then . . . ”
He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hustle
through Gregorovitch’s eyes, into his memories. . . .
“He read Gregorovitch’s mind, and I saw this young bloke
perched on a windowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and
jumped out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever You-KnowWho’s after. And I . . . I think I’ve seen him somewhere. . . .”
Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing
boy’s face. The theft had happened many years ago, according to
Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look so familiar?
The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the
tent; all Harry could hear was Ron’s breathing. After a while, Ron
whispered, “Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?”
“No . . . it must’ve been something small.”
“Harry?”
The wooden slats of Ron’s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed.
“Harry, you don’t reckon You-Know-Who’s after something else
to turn into a Horcrux?”
“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly, “Maybe. But wouldn’t it be
dangerous for him to make another one? Didn’t Hermione say he
had pushed his soul to the limit already?”
“Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.”
“Yeah . . . maybe,” said Harry.
He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way
around the problem of the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought
a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and yet he had killed him,
apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore.
282
The Thief
What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of
Magic and the Wizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent
on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, and
which had been stolen by the unknown thief?
Harry could still see the blond-haired youth’s face; it was merry,
it was wild; there was a Fred and George-ish air of triumphant
trickery about him. He had soared from the windowsill like a bird,
and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . .
With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was
in danger now, and it was on him that Harry’s thoughts dwelled,
as Ron’s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he
himself drifted slowly into sleep once more.
283
Chapter 15
The Goblin’s Revenge
E
arly next morning, before the other two were awake,
Harry left the tent to search the woods around them
for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient—looking tree
he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye
Moody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the
bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that MadEye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores
Umbridge’s door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the
others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next.
Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere
too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next
move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione
therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the
clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show that they had camped
there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market
town.
Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of
284
The Goblin’s Revenge
trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments,
Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance.
This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the
town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden
darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood.
“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested Ron, when
Harry arrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and
mouthing the single word, dementors.
“I couldn’t . . . make one,” he panted, clutching the stitch in his
side. “Wouldn’t come.”
Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made
Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing
the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing,
as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming
filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself.
It had taken all Harry’s will power to uproot himself from the
spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the
Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly
feel the despair they cast wherever they went.
“So we still haven’t got any food.”
“Shut up, Ron,” snapped Hermione. “Harry, what happened?
Why do you think you couldn’t make your Patronus? You managed
perfectly yesterday ”
“I don’t know.”
He sat low in one of Perkins’s old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone
wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago. Today he
might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express.
285
Chapter 15
Ron kicked a chair leg.
“What?” he snarled at Hermione. “I’m starving! All I’ve had
since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!”
“You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,” said
Harry, stung.
“I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!”
“That’s convenient.”
“And what’s that supposed to—?”
“Of course!” cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead
and startling both of them into silence. “Harry, give me the locket!
Come on,” she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him, when
he did not react, “the Horcrux, Harry, you’re still wearing it!”
She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over
his head. The moment it parted contact with Harry’s skin he felt
free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy
or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until
both sensations lifted.
“Better?” asked Hermione.
“Yeah, loads better!”
“Harry,” she said, crouching down in front of him and using the
kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, “you don’t
think you’ve been possessed, do you?”
“What? No!” he said defensively. “I remember everything
we’ve done while I’ve been wearing it. I wouldn’t know what I’d
done if I’d been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times
when she couldn’t remember anything.’
“Hmm,” said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket.
“Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it at
the tent.”
286
The Goblin’s Revenge
“We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,” Harry stated
firmly. “If we lose it, if it gets stolen— ”
“Oh, all right, all right,” said Hermione, and she placed it
around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front
of her shirt. “But we’ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it
on for too long.”
“Great,” said Ron irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that out,
can we please get some food?”
“Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said Hermione
with half a glance at Harry. “There’s no point staying where we
know dementors are swooping around.”
In the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field
belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain
eggs and bread.
“It’s not stealing, is it?” asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as
they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. “Not if I left some money
under the chicken coop?”
Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, “’Er—
my—nee, ’oo worry ’oo much. ‘Elax!”
And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed. The argument about the dementors was forgotten
in the laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful as
he took the first of the three night watches.
This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach
meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry
was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near
starvation at the Dursleys. Hermione bore up reasonably well on
those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries
or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual
287
Chapter 15
and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used
to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the
Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable
and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron’s turn to
wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant.
“So where next?” was his constant refrain. He did not seem
to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to
come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food
supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours
trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and
how to destroy the one they had already got, their conversations
becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no new information.
As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had
hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept teching, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born
and raised; Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and
Burkes, where he had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis
of their speculations.
“Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,” said Ron sarcastically.
“There can’t be anything there. He’d already made five of his
Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain
the snake is the sixth,” said Hermione. “We know the snake’s not
in Albania, it’s usually with Vol— ”
“Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that?”
“Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who—happy?”
“Not particularly.”
288
The Goblin’s Revenge
“I can’t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,” said
Harry, who made this point many times before, but said it again
simply to break the nasty silence. “Borgin and Burke were experts
at Dark objects, they would’ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway.”
Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry plowed on, “I still reckon he might have hidden
something at Hogwarts.”
Hermione sighed.
“But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!”
Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of
this theory.
“Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew
all of Hogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place
Vol— ”
“Oi!”
“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. “If there was one place that was really important to
You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!”
“Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His school?”
“Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that
meant he was special: it meant everything to him, and even after
he left— ” inquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and
throttle him.
“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give
him a job after he left,” said Hermione.
“That’s right,” said Harry.
“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try
and find something, probably another founder’s object, to make
289
Chapter 15
into another Horcrux?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he
never got the chance to find a founder’s object there and hide it in
the school!”
“Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.”
Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden
beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which
Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and
discovered from their records that the place had been demolished
many years before. They visited its site and found a tower block
of offices.
“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested
halfheartedly.
“He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,” Harry said. He had
known all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had
been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his
soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought
grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner
of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts
or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank,
with its golden doors and marble floors.
Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through
the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night
for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely
and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the
shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered a pebbly cove. Every twelve hours
290
The Goblin’s Revenge
or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were
playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where
they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve
hours of increased fear and anxiety.
Harry’s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed,
when he was wearing the Hocrux. Sometimes he could not stop
himself reacting to the pain.
“What? What did you see?” demanded Ron, whenever he
noticed Harry wince.
“A face,” muttered Harry, every time. “The same face. The
thief who stole from Gregorovitch.”
And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of
his family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after
all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what
Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took
his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts,
Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry’s
scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired by swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain
or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at
the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when
they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes.
As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that
Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about,
him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled
a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times
291
Chapter 15
they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and
hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.
Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed
to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey
because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn
in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood,
and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed
by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further
Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him
was Hogwarts, and as neither of the other thought this at all likely,
he stopped suggesting it.
Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it.
They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the dementors: wind and rain added
to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at
identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their
continuing isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or their
total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort.
“My mother,” said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a
riverbank in Wales, “can make good fear appear out of thin air.”
He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his
plate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron’s neck and saw, as
he had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there.
He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose
attitude, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off
the locket.
“Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione. “No one can. Food is one of the first of five Principal
Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfigur—’
292
The Goblin’s Revenge
“Oh, speak English, can’t you?” Ron said, prising a fish bone
out from between his teeth.
“It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can
Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can
increase the quantity if you’ve already got some— ”
“Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,” said Ron.
“Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I’m
always the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I’m a
girl, I suppose!”
“No, it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at magic!” shot
back Ron.
Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate
onto the floor.
“You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and
I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you— ”
“Shut up!” said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both
hands. “Shut up now!”
Hermione looked outraged.
“How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook— ”
“Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!”
He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not
to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them,
he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It
was not moving.
“You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?” he whispered to
Hermione.
“I did everything,” she whispered back, “Muffliato, MuggleRepelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn’t
293
Chapter 15
be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.”
Heavy scuffling and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged
stones and twigs told them that several people were clambering
down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank
where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting.
The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be
sufficient, ion the near total darkness, to shield them from the
notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were
Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested
by Dark Magic for the first time.
The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group
of men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were
fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag
and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily
inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed
the other ends out of the tent entrance.
Within second Harry heard a weary male voice.
“There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d’you reckon it’s
too early in the season? Accio Salmon!”
There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping
sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively,
Harry pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the
murmur of the river he could make out more voices, bu they were
not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It
was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural
noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly
lower, slower voice than the other.
294
The Goblin’s Revenge
A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large
shadows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of
baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came
the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.
“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.”
Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded.
“Thank you,” said the goblins together in English.
“So, you three been on the run how long?” asked a new, mellow,
and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured
a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man.
“Six weeks . . . seven . . . I forget,” said the tired man. “Met up
with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with
Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.” There
was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked
up and replaced on the ground. “What made you leave, Ted?”
continued the man.
“Knew they were coming for me,” replied mellow-voiced Ted,
and Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks’s father. “Heard
Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I’d better run
for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I
knew it was a matter of time, knew I’d have to leave in the end.
My wife should be okay, she’s pure-blood. And then I meant Dean
where, what, a few days ago, son?”
“Yeah,” said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione
stared at each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow
Gryffindor.
“Muggle-born, eh?” asked the first man.
“Not sure,” said Dean. “My dad left my mum when I was a
295
Chapter 15
kid. I’ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.”
There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching;
then Ted spoke again.
I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. Pleased,
but surprised. Word was you’d been caught.”
“I was,” said Dirk. “I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a
break for it. Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier
than you’d think; I don’t think he’s quite at the moment. Might
be Confunded. If so, I’d like to shake the hand of the witch or
wizard who did it, probably saved my life.”
There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river
rushed on. Then Ted said, “And where do you two fit in? I, er,
had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the
whole.”
“You had a false impression,” said the higher voiced of the goblins. “We take no sides. This is a wizards’ war.”
“How come you’re in hiding, then?”
‘I deemed it prudent,” said the deeper-voiced goblin. “Having
refused what I considered an impertinent request, I could see that
my personal safety was in jeopardy.”
“What did they ask you to do?” asked Ted.
“Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,” replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less human as he said it. “I am not a
house-elf.”
“What about you, Griphook?”
“Similar reasons,” said the higher voiced goblin. “Gringotts
is no longer under the sole control of my race. I recognize no
Wizarding master.”
He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and
296
The Goblin’s Revenge
Gornuk laughed.
“What’s the joke?” asked Dean.
“He said,” replied Dirk, “that there are things wizards don’t
recognize, either.”
There was a short pause.
“I don’t get it,” said Dean.
“I had my small revenge before I left,” said Griphook in English.
“Good man— goblin, I should say,” amended Ted hastily.
“Didn’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old highsecurity vaults, I suppose?”
“If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,”
replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry
chuckle.
“Dean and I are still missing something here,” said Ted.
“So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,” said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside
the tent Harry’s breathing was shallow with excitement: He and
Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could.
“Didn’t you hear about that, Ted?” asked Dirk. “About the
kid who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of Snape’s office at
Hogwarts?”
And electric current seemed to curse through Harry, jangling
his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot.
“Never heard a word,” said Ted. “Not in the Prophet, was it?”
“Hardly,” chortled dirk. “Griphook here told me, he heard
about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the
kids who tried to take the sword was Bill’s younger sister.”
Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were
clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines.
297
Chapter 15
“She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s office and smashed
open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword.
Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the
staircase.”
“Ah, God bless ’em,” said Ted. “What did they think, that
they’d be able to use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape
himself?”
“Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it,
Snape decided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,” said Dirk.
“Couple of days later, once he’d got the say-so from You-KnowWho, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts
instead.”
The goblins started to laugh again.
“I’m still not seeing the joke,” said Ted.
“It’s a fake,” rasped Griphook.
“The sword of Gryffindor!”
“Oh yes. It is a copy— an excellent copy, it is true-but it was
Wizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and
had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at
Gringotts bank.”
“I see,” said Ted. “And I take it you didn’t bother telling the
Death Eaters this?”
“I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,” said
Griphook smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and
Dirk’s laughter.
Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask
the question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed
ten, Dean obliged: he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex298
The Goblin’s Revenge
boyfriend of Ginny’s too.
“What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried
to steal it?”
“Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,” said Griphook indifferently.
“They’re okay, though?” asked Ted quickly. “I mean, the
Weasley don’t need any more of their kids injured, do they?”
“They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,” said
Griphook.
“Lucky for them,” said Ted. “With Snape’s track record I suppose we should just be glad they’re still alive.”
“You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?” asked Dirk. “You
believe Snape killed Dumbledore?”
“Course I do,” said Ted. “You’re not going to sit there and tell
me you think Potter had anything to do with it?”
“Hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered Dirk.
“I know Harry Potter,” said Dean. “And I reckon he’s the real
thing—The Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.”
“Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,” said
Dirk, me included. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of
things. You’d think if he knew anything we don’t, or had anything
special going for him, he’d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a
pretty good case against him— ”
“The Prophet?” scoffed Ted. “You deserved to be lied to if
you’re still reading that muck, Dirk. You want the facts, try the
Quibbler.”
There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a
good deal of thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a
299
Chapter 15
fish bone. At last he spluttered, “The Quibbler? That lunatic rag
of Xeno Lovegood’s?”
“It’s not so lunatic these days,” said Ted. “You want to give it
a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet’s ignoring, not
a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue.
How long they’ll let you get away with it, mind, I don’t know.
But Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who’s
against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their
number-one priority.”
“Hard to help a boy who’s vanished off the face of the earth,”
said Dirk.
“Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell
of an achievement,” said Ted. “I’d take tip from him gladly; It’s
what we’re trying to do, stay free, isn’t it?”
“Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,” said Dirk heavily. “With
the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him I’d
have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who’s to say they
haven’t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?”
“Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,” murmured Ted.
There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and
forks. When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought
to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding
the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then
clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears.
Harry, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to
say more than, “Ginny— the sword— ”
“I know!” said Hermione.
300
The Goblin’s Revenge
She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm
in it right up to the armpit.
“Here . . . we . . . are . . . ” she said between gritted teeth, and
she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag.
Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry
hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas
Nigellus free of Hermione’s bag, she kept her wand pointing at it,
ready to cast a spell at any moment.
“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was
in Dumbledore’s office,” she panted, as they propped the painting
against the side of the tent, “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it
happen, he hangs right beside the case!”
“Unless he was asleep,” said Harry, but he still held his breath
as Hermione knelt down in the front of the empty canvas, her wand
directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said:
“Er—Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?”
Nothing happened.
“Phineas Nigellus?” said Hermione again. “Professor Black?
Please could we talk to you? Please?”
“‘Please’ always helps,” said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas
Nigellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried:
“Obscura!”
A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus’s clever, dark
eyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain.
“What—how dare—what are you—?”
“I’m very sorry, Professor Black,” said Hermione, “but it’s a
necessary precaution!”
“Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are
ruining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?”
301
Chapter 15
“Never mind where we are,” said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus
froze, abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold.
“Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?”
“Maybe,” said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas
Nigellus’s interest. “We’ve got a couple of questions to ask you—
about the sword of Gryffindor.”
“Ah,” said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and
that in an effort to catch sight of Harry, “yes. That silly girl acted
most unwisely there— ”
“Shut up about my sister,” said Ron roughly. Phineas Nigellus
raised supercilious eyebrows.
“Who else is here?” he asked, turning his head from side to side.
“Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy
in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster.”
“They weren’t thieving,” said Harry. “That sword isn’t
Snape’s.”
“It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She
deserved his punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the
Lovegood oddity!”
“Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!” said Hermione.
“Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle
with the blindfold again. “Where have you brought me? Why have
you removed me from the house of my forebears?”
“Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and
Luna?” asked Harry urgently.
“Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do
some work for the oaf, Hagrid.”
302
The Goblin’s Revenge
“Hagrid’s not an oaf!” said Hermione shrilly.
“And Snape might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said
Harry, “but Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh
with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse
than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!”
He felt relieved: he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus
Curse at the very least.
“What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether
anyone else has, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it’s been
taken away for cleaning or— or something?”
Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes
and sniggered.
“Muggle-borns,” he said. “Goblin-made armor does not require
cleaning, simple girl. Goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing
only that which strengthens it.”
“Don’t call Hermione simple,” said Harry.
“I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmaster’s office?”
Still blindfolded, eh began groping the side of his frame, trying
to feel a way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts.
Harry had a sudden inspiration.
“Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?”
“I beg you pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus.
“Professor Dumbledore’s portrait—couldn’t you bring him
along, here, into yours?”
Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry’s
voice.
“Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter.
The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but
303
Chapter 15
they cannot ravel outside the castle except to visit a painting of
themselves hanging elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with
me, and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can
assure you that I shall not be making a return visit!”
Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame.
“Professor Black,” said Hermione, “couldn’t you just tell us,
please, when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case?
Before Ginny took it out, I mean?”
Phineas snorted impatiently.
“I believe the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its
case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.”
Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them
dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the exit.
“Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, and he
began to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim
remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout.
“Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?”
Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture.
“Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than
the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!”
And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him
nothing but his murky backdrop.
“Harry!” Hermione cried.
“I know!” Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he
punched the air: it was more than he had dared to hope for. He
strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a
304
The Goblin’s Revenge
mile: he did not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s portrait back into the beaded bag, when
she had fastened their clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a
shining face to Harry.
“The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which can strengthen them—Harry, that sword’s
impregnated with basilisk venom!”
“And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed
it, he wanted to use it on the locket— ”
“— and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if
he put in his will— ”
“— so he made a copy— ”
“— and put a fake in the glass case— ”
“— and he left the real one—where?”
They gazed at each other: Harry felt the answer was dangling
invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn’t
Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry
had not realized it at the time?
“Think!” whispered Hermione. “Think! Where would he have
left it?”
“Not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, resuming his pacing.
“Somewhere in Hogsmeade?” suggested Hermione.
“The Shrieking Shack?” said Harry. “Nobody ever goes in
there.”
But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?”
Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her.
Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the words,” said
Hermione.
“Yeah, you’re right!” said Harry, and he felt even more cheered
305
Chapter 15
at the thought that Dumbledore had some reservations, however
faint, about Snape’s trustworthiness. “So, would he have hidden
the sword well away from Hogsmeade then? What d’you reckon,
Ron? Ron?”
Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought
that Ron had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the
shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony.
“Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said.
“What?”
Ron snorted as he started up at the underside of the upper
bunk.
“You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.”
Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook
her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was.
“What’s the problem?” asked Harry.
“Problem? There’s no problem,” said Ron, still refusing to look
at Harry. “Not according to you, anyway.”
There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It
had started to rain.
“Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,” said Harry. “Spit it
out, will you?”
Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked
mean, unlike himself.
“All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down
the tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find.
Just add it to the list of stuff you don’t know.”
“I don’t know?” repeated Harry. “I don’t know?”
Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it
pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river
306
The Goblin’s Revenge
chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry’s jubilation. Ron
was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be
thinking.
“It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,” said Ron,
“you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing
my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d
been running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something.”
“Ron,” Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could
pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now
beating on the tent.
“I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,” said Harry.
“Yeah, I thought I did too.”
“So what part of it isn’t living up to expectations?” asked
Harry. Anger was coming to his defense now. “Did you think we’d
be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?”
“We thought you knew what you were doing!” shouted Ron,
standing up, and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. “We
thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had
a real plan!”
“Ron!” said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain
thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her.
“Well, sorry to let you down,” said Harry, his voice quite calm
even though he felt hollow, inadequate. “I’ve been straight with
you from the start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me.
And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found on Horcrux— ”
“Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to
finding the rest of them—nowhere effing near in other words?”
“Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually
307
Chapter 15
high. “Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you
hadn’t been wearing it all day.”
“Yeah, he would,” said Harry, who did not want excuses made
for Ron. “D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering
behind my back? D’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this
stuff?”
“Harry we weren’t— ”
“Don’t lie!” Ron hurled at her. “You said it too, you said you
were disappointed, you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go
on than— ”
“I didn’t say it like that—Harry, I didn’t!” she cried.
The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione’s face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared
and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of
Gryffindor was hidden they knew not where, and they were three
teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be
dead.
“So why are you still here?” Harry asked Ron.
“Search me,” said Ron.
“Go home then,” said Harry.
“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron, and he took several steps
toward Harry, who did not back away. “Didn’t you hear what they
said about my sister? But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s
only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I’ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn’t
care what happens to her in there—well, I do, all right, giant spider
and mental stuff— ”
“I was only saying— she was with the others, they were with
Hagrid— ”
308
The Goblin’s Revenge
“Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my
family, the Weasleys don’t need another kid injured, did you hear
that?”
“Yeah, I— ”
“Not bothered what it meant, though?”
“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don’t
think it means anything new has happened, anything we don’t
know about: think, Ron, Bill’s already scarred; plenty of people
must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you’re
supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I’m sure that’s
all he meant— ”
“Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t bother
myself about them. It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your
parents safely out of the way— ”
“My parents are dead!” Harry bellowed.
“And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron.
“Then GO!” roared Harry. “Go back to them, pretend you’ve
got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up
and— ”
Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either
wand was clear of its owner’s pocket, Hermione had raised her own.
“Protego!” she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between
her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them
were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and
Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier
as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time.
Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: Something had broken
between them.
“Leave the Horcrux,” Harry said.
309
Chapter 15
Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket
into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione.
“What are you doing?”
“What do you mean?”
“Are you staying or what?”
“I . . . ” She looked anguished. “Yes—yes, I’m staying, Ron, we
said we’d go with Harry, we said we’d help— ”
“I get it. You choose him.”
“Ron, no—please—come back, come back!”
She was impeded by her own Shield charm; by the time she had
removed it he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood
quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron’s
name amongst the trees.
After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to
her face.
“He’s g–g–gone! Disapparated!”
She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry.
Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and
placed it around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron’s
bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his
own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the
pounding of the rain.
310
Chapter 16
Godric’s Hollow
W
hen Harry woke the following day it was several
seconds before he remembered what had happened. Then he hoped, childishly, that it had been
a dream, that Ron was still there and never left. Yet
by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron’s deserted bunk.
It was like a dead body in the way it seemed to draw his eyes.
Harry jumped down from his own bed, keeping his eyes averted
from Ron’s. Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did
not wish Harry good morning, but turned her face away quickly as
he went by.
He’s gone. Harry told himself. He’s gone. He had to keep
thinking it as he washed and dressed, as though repetition would
dull the shock of it. He’s gone and he’s not coming back. And that
was the simple truth of it. Harry knew, because their protective
enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they vacated
this spot, for Ron to find them again.
He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione’s eyes were
puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up
311
Chapter 16
their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to
spin out their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look
up eagerly and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking
that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired
figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her,
looked around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and
saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury
exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, “We thought you
knew what you were doing!”, and he resumed packing with a hard
knot in the pit of his stomach.
The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon
spill over onto their bank. They had lingered a good hour after
they would usually have departed their campsite. Finally having
entirely repacked the beaded bag three times. Hermione seemed
unable to find any more reasons to delay: She and Harry grasped
hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept heathercovered hillside.
The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry’s hand and
walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock; her face
on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched
her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something
kept him rooted to the spot. Everything inside him felt cold and
tight: Again he saw the contemptuous expression on Ron’s face.
Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with
the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually
performed to ensure their protection.
They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry
was determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione
seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although some312
Godric’s Hollow
times at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her
crying. Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder’s
Map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron’s labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of
Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle,
protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear
on the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out
simply to stare at Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering
whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into
her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about
her, hoping that she was all right.
By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the
possible locations of Gryffindor’s sword, but the more they talked
about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the
more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel
his brains though he might, Harry could not remember Dumbledore
ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. There
were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with
Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what you were
doing. . . . We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do. . . . We
thought you had a real plan!
He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him virtually nothing. They had discovered one
Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it: The others were
as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to
engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own presumption
in accepting his friends’ offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he
was constantly painfully on the alert for any indication that Her313
Chapter 16
mione too was about to tell him that she had had enough, that she
was leaving.
They were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping
hole left by Ron’s departure. Despite his previous assertion that
he would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem
able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was
up to, and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so.
Harry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit
of a snide and taunting kind. They relished any news about what
was happening in Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an
ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be
careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape,
or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.
However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be
facing a constant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students.
Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had
reinstated Umbridge’s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or
more students or any unofficial student societies.
From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to
continue Dumbledore’s Army. This scant news made Harry want
to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made
him think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. Indeed
as Phineas Nigellus talked about Snape’s crackdown, Harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going
314
Godric’s Hollow
back to school to join the destabilization of Snape’s regime. Being fed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in charge,
seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment.
But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One,
that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head, and that
to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking
into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently
emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about Harry
and Hermione’s whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside
the beaded bag every time he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious
good-byes.
The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain
in any one area too long, so rather than staying in the south of
England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries,
they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a
mountainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh,
where the tent was flooded with chill water: and a tiny island in
the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow buried the tent in the
night.
They already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several
sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry
resolved to suggest, again, what seemed to him the only unexplored
avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal:
Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak
(scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left),
and Harry thought she might be more persuadable than usual on
a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. He had
also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours’ break
315
Chapter 16
from wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the
bank beside him.
“Hermione?”
“Hmm?” She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs
with The Tales of Beedle the Bard. He could not imagine how
much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after
all, very long, but evidently she was still deciphering something in
it, because Spellman’s Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair.
Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the
occasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor
McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact
that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.
“Hermione, I’ve been thinking, and— “
“Harry, could you help me with something?”
Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and held out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.
“Look at the symbol.” She said, pointing to the top of a page.
Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable
to read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what
looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.
“I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione”
“I know that, but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the syllabary,
either. All along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don’t
think it is! It’s been inked in, look, somebody’s drawn it there, it
isn’t really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?”
“No . . . No, wait a moment.” Harry looked closer. “Isn’t it the
same symbol Luna’s dad was wearing around his neck?”
“Well, that’s what I thought too!”
“Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark”
316
Godric’s Hollow
She stared at him, open mouthed.
“What?”
“Krum told me . . . “
He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the
wedding. Hermione looked astonished,
“Grindelwald’s mark?”
She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again.
“I’ve never heard that Grindelwald had a mark. There’s no mention of it in anything I’ve read about him.”
“Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a
wall at Durmstrang, and Grindelwald put it there.”
She fell back into the old armchair, frowning.
“That’s very odd. If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s it
doing in a book of children’s stories?”
“Yeah it is weird.” Said Harry. “And you’d think Scrimgeour
would have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been
expert on Dark stuff”
“I know . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did.
All the other stories have little pictures over the titles.”
She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark.
Harry tried again.
“Hermione?”
“Hmm?”
“I’ve been thinking. I— I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.”
She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was
sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book.
“Yes.” She said. “Yes, I’ve been wondering that too. I really
think we’ll have to.”
“Did you hear me right?” he asked.
317
Chapter 16
“Of course I did. You want to go to Godric’s Hollow. I agree, I
think we should. I mean, I can’t think of anywhere else it could be
either. It’ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more
likely it seems it’s there.”
“Er—what’s there?” asked Harry.
At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt.
“Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you’d
want to go back there, and I mean, Godric’s Hollow is Godric
Gryffindor’s birthplace— “
“Really? Gryffindor came from Godric’s Hollow?”
“Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?”
“Erm,” he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in
months. The muscles in his face felt oddly stiff. “I might’ve opened
you know, when I bought it . . . just the once . . . “
“Well as the village is named after him I’d have thought you
might have made the connection.” Said Hermione. She sounded
much more like her old self that she had done of late; Harry half
expected her to announce that she was off to the library. “There’s
a bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait . . . “
She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally
extracting her copy of the old school textbook. A History of Magic
by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through until finding the
page she wanted.
“Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in
1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps,
that they formed their own small communities within a community. Many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical
families, who banded together for mutual support and protection.
The villages of Tinworthin Cornwald, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire,
318
Godric’s Hollow
and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside
tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of
these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric’s Hollow, the
West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was
born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the first
Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt for the stories of hauntings
that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.”
“You and your parents aren’t mentioned.” Hermione said, closing the book, “because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything
later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hollow, Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor’s sword: don’t you
think Dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection?”
“Oh yeah . . . “
Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking
about the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hollow. For him, the lure of the village lay as his parents’ graves, the
house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of
Bathilda Bagshot.
“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually.
“Who?”
“You know” he hesitated. He did not want to say Ron’s name.
“Ginny’s great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had
skinny ankles.”
“Oh.” Said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew
that she had sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:
“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”
319
Chapter 16
“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index
finger over Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic. “Well, I suppose— “
She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over, he
drew his wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to
see a hand forcing it sway through the entrance flap, but there was
nothing there.
“What?” he said, half angry, half relieved. “What did you do
that for? Thought you’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent,
at least— “
“Harry, what if Bathilda’s got the sword? What if Dumbledore
entrusted it to her?”
Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was
“gaga.” Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the
sword of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore
had left a great deal to chance: Dumbledore had never revealed
that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much
mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the
moment to cast doubt on Hermione’s theory, not when she was so
surprisingly willing to fall in with Harry’s dearest wish.
“Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric’s
Hollow?”
“Yes, but we’ll have to think in through carefully, Harry.” She
was sitting up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of having
a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. “We’ll need to
practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a
start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too,
unless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice
320
Godric’s Hollow
Potion? In that case we’ll need to collect hair from somebody. I
actually think we’d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises
the better . . . “
Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a
pause, but his mind had left the conversation. For the first time
since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he
felt excited.
He was about to go home, about to return to the place where
he had had a family. It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday.
He could have invited friends to his house. . . . He might even have
had brothers and sisters. . . . It would have been his mother who
had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had
hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew
he was about to see the place were it had been taken from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted
his rucksack from Hermione’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the
photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago. For the first
time in months, he pursued the old pictures of his parents, smiling
and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left
of them now.
Harry would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the following day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was
that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his
parents’ deaths, she was determined that they would set off only
after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It
was therefore a full week later— once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping,
and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while underneath
321
Chapter 16
the Invisibility Cloak together— that Hermione agreed to make the
journey.
They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness,
so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man,
Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag
containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which
Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside
pocket of Hermione’s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating
darkness once again.
Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were
standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky in
which the night’s first stars were already glimmering feebly. Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a
glow of golden streetlights indicated the centre of the village.
“All this snow!” Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. “Why
didn’t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave
prints! We’ll just have to get rid of them—you go in front, I’ll do
it— ”
Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse,
trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their
traces.
“Let’s take off the Cloak.” said Harry, and when she looked
frightened, “Oh, come on, we don’t look like us and there’s no one
around.”
He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way
forward unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed
322
Godric’s Hollow
more cottages. Anyone of them might have been the one in which
James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry
gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their frost
porches, wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing
deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more
than a year old when he had left this place forever. He was not
even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did
not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm
died. Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to
the left and the heart of the village, a small square, was revealed
to them.
Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked
like a war memorial in the mile, partly obscured by a windblown
Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub and a
little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-bright
across the square.
The snow here had become impacted, It was hard and slippery
where people had trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing
in front of them, their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps.
They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door
opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little
church.
“Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said Hermione.
“Is it?”
He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper
for weeks.
“I’m sure it is.” Said Hermione, her eyes upon the church.
“They . . . they’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I
can see the graveyard behind it.”
323
Chapter 16
Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement,
more like fear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether
he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was
feeling, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for
the first time, pulling him forward. Halfway across the square,
however, she stopped dead.
“Harry, look!”
She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it,
it had transformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there
was a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses,
a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy
sitting in his mother’s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like
fluffy white caps.
Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces. He had
never imagined that there would be a statue. . . . How strange it
was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a
scar on his forehead. . . .
“C’mon,” said Harry, when he had looked his fill they turned
again toward the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over
his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war memorial.
The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It
made Harry’s throat constrict. It reminded him so forcefully of
Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside
suits of armor, of the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a
hand-knitted sweater . . .
There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through
it. On either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow
324
Godric’s Hollow
lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carving
deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building,
keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows.
Behind the church row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling
red, gold, and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass
hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his
jacket pocket. Harry moved toward the nearest grave.
“Look at this, it’s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation
of Hannah’s!”
“Keep your voice down.” Hermione begged him.
They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark
tracks into the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on
old headstones, every now and then squinting into the surrounding
darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.
“Harry, here!”
Hermione was two rows of tombstones away: he had to wade
back to her, his heart positively banging in his chest.
“Is it—?”
“No, but look!”
She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw,
upon the frozen lichen-spotted granite, the words Kendra Dumbledore and, a short way below her dates of birth and death, and
Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation:
Where you treasure is, there will your heart be also.
So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right.
The Dumbledore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had
died here.
325
Chapter 16
Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could
not help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in
this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet
he had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here
with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would been, of how much
it would have meant to him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore,
the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard
had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the
job he wanted Harry to do.
Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face
was hidden in shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again.
Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not
understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once his mother had
died.
“Are you sure he never mentioned—?” Hermione began.
“No,” said Harry curtly, then, “let’s keep looking,” and he
turned away, wishing he had not seen the stone. He did not want
his excited trepidation tainted with resentment.
“Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of
the darkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.” She was
rubbing at a crumpling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little
frown on her face.
“Harry, come back a moment.”
He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly
made his way back through the snow toward her.
“What?”
“Look at this!”
326
Godric’s Hollow
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could
hardly make out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol
beneath it.
“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”
He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn
that it was hard to make out what was engraved there, though
there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible
name.
“Yeah . . . it could be . . . ”
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
“It says Ig— Ignotus, I think . . . ”
“I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?” Harry
told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her
crouched beside the old grave.
Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott,
he had met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the graveyard.
Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the
current members had moved away from Godric’s Hollow. Deeper
and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every time he reached
a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.
The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden,
much deeper. Harry looked around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had finished, that the chatter
and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way
back into the square. Somebody inside the church had just turned
off the lights.
327
Chapter 16
Then Hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for the third
time, sharp and clear from a few yards away.
“Harry, they’re here . . . right here.”
And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and his father
this time. He moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy
were pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right
after Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on
his heart and lungs.
The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana’s.
It was made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and
this made it easy to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry
did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out
the words engraved upon it.
James Potter Lily Potter

The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one
chance to take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud.
“‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’ . . . ” A horrible thought came to him, and with it a kind of panic. “Isn’t that
a Death Eater idea? Why is that here?”
“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters
mean it, Harry,” said Hermione, her voice gentle. “It means . . . you
know . . . living beyond death. Living after death.”
But they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The
empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents’ moldering
remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And
328
Godric’s Hollow
tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly
freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or
pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking
down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the
last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing
or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating,
alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment,
that he was sleeping under the snow with them.
Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly.
He could not look at her, but returned the pressure, now taking
deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying to
regain control. He should have brought something to give to them,
and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was
leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a
circle through the air and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed
before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents’ grave.
As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave. He did not think
he could stand another moment there. He put his arm around
Hermione’s shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they
turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore’s mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the
out-of-sight kissing gate.
329
Chapter 17
Bathilda’s Secret
H
arry, stop.”
“What’s wrong?”
They had only just reached the grave of the unknown
Abbott.
“There’s someone there. Someone’s watching us. I can tell. There:
over by the bushes.”
They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the
dense black boundary of the graveyard. Harry could not see anything.
“Are you sure?”
“I saw something move, I could have sworn I did . . . ”
She broke from him to free her wand arm.
“We look like Muggles,” Harry pointed out.
“Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave!
Harry, I’m sure there’s someone over there!”
Harry thought of A History of Magic, the graveyard was supposed to be haunted, what if—? But then he heard a rustle and
saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione
330
Bathilda’s Secret
had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow.
“It’s a cat,” said Harry, after a second or two, “or a bird. If it
was a Death Eater we’d be dead by now. But let’s get out of here,
and we can put the Cloak back on.”
They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of
the graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had
pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate
and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back
over themselves. The pub was fuller than before: Many voices
inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they
approached the church. For a moment Harry considered suggesting
they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione murmured, “Lets go this way,” and pulled him down the
dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from
which they had entered. Harry could make out the point where the
cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They
walked as quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with
multicolored light, the outlines of Christmas trees dark through the
curtains.
“How are we going to find Bathilda’s house?” asked Hermione,
who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder.
“Harry? What do you think? Harry?”
She tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He
was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this
row of houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione
along with him; she slipped a little on the ice.
“Harry— ”
“Look . . . Look at it Hermione . . . ”
“I don’t . . . oh!”
He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James
331
Chapter 17
and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since
Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst
the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though
entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top
floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the
curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing
at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those
that flanked it.
“I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” whispered Hermione.
“Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied, “Maybe it’s like
the injuries from Dark Magic and you can’t repair the damage?”
He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the
snowy and thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply
to hold some part of the house.
“You’re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might— oh,
Harry, look!”
His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had
risen out of the ground in front of them, up through the tangles
of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in
golden letters upon the wood it said:
On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981,
Lily and James Potter lost their lives.
Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard
ever to have survived the Killing Curse.
This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left
in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters
and as a reminder of the violence
that tore apart their family.
And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been
332
Bathilda’s Secret
added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place
where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. Some had merely signed
their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into
the wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these,
shining brightly over sixteen years’ worth of magical graffiti, all
said similar things.
Good luck, Harry wherever you are.
If you read this, Harry, we’re all behind you!
Long live Harry Potter.
“They shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said Hermione,
indignant.
But Harry beamed at her.
“It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I . . . ”
He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane
toward them, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square.
Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was
a woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping
on the snowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait
all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as
she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn
into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew instinctively
that she would not. At last she came to a half a few yards from
the and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing
them.
He did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm. There was next
to no chance this woman was a Muggle: She was standing there
gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to
her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch,
however, it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold,
333
Chapter 17
simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic,
meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all.
Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that
they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had reached
this uneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned.
Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed
against his.
“How does she know?”
He shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons,
and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger
every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted
street.
Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these
long months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that
Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely that it was she
who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed
them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some
Dumbledore-ish power that he had never encountered before.
Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump.
“Are you Bathilda?”
The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again.
Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other.
Harry raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod.
They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and
hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several
houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front
path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had
just left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door,
then opened it and stepped back to let them pass.
334
Bathilda’s Secret
She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house. Harry wrinkled
his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now
that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down
with age she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door
behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling
paint, then turned and peered into Harry’s face. Her eyes were
thick with cataracts and sunken in folds of transparent skin, and
her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He
wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she could,
it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she
would see.
The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food
intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a
head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly.
“Bathilda?” Harry repeated.
She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his
skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken;
he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could
it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near?
Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though
she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting
room.
“Harry, I’m not sure about this,” breathed Hermione.
“Look at the size of her, I think we could overpower her if we
had to,” said Harry, “Listen, I should have told you, I knew she
wasn’t all there. Muriel called her ‘gaga.’”
“Come!” called Bathilda from the next room.
Hermione jumped and clutched Harry’s arm.
“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the
sitting room.
335
Chapter 17
Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candle, but
it was still very dark, not to mention extremely dirty. Thick dust
crunched beneath their feet, and Harry’s nose detected, underneath
the dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone bad.
He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda’s house to check whether she was coping. She seemed to have
forgotten that she could do magic too, for she lit the candles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching
fire.
“Let me do that,” offered Harry and he took the matches from
her. She stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle
stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously
on stack of book and on side tables crammed with cracked and
moldy cups.
The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bowfronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of
photographs. When the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements
from the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he
muttered “Tergeo”; the dust vanished from the photographs, and
he was at once that half a down were missing from the largest and
most ornate frames.
He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed
them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up.
It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who
had perched on Gregorovitch’s windowsill, smiling lazily up at
Harry out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly
where he had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus
Dumbledore, arm in arm with teenage Dumbledore, and that must
336
Bathilda’s Secret
be where all the missing photographs were in Rita’s book.
“Mrs.—Miss—Bagshot?” he said, and his voice shook slightly.
“Who is this?”
Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her.
“Miss Bagshot?” Harry repeated, and he advanced with the
picture in his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace.
Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux heat faster upon
his chest.
“Who is this person?” Harry asked her, pushing the picture
forward.
She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry.
“Do you know who this is?” he repeated in a much slower and
louder voice than usual. “This man? Do you know him? What’s
he called?”
Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration.
How had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda’s memories?
“Who is this man?” he repeated loudly.
“Harry, what are you doing?” asked Hermione.
“This picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who stole from
Gregorovitch! Please!” he said to Bathilda. “Who is this?”
But she only stared at him.
“Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs.—Miss—
Bagshot?” asked Hermione, raising her own voice. “Was there
something you wanted to tell us?”
Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now
shuffled a few steps closer to Harry. With a little jerk of her head
she looked back into the hall.
“You want us to leave?” he asked.
337
Chapter 17
She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then
at herself, then at the ceiling.
“Oh, right . . . Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs
with her.”
“All right,” said Hermione, “let’s go.”
But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more pointing first at Harry, then to herself.
“She wants me to go with her, alone.”
“Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and
clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at
the loud noise.
“Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only
me?”
“Do you really think she knows who you are?”
“Yes,” said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon
his own, “I think she does.”
“Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.”
“Lead the way,” Harry told Bathilda.
She seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him
toward the door. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring
smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself
in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase.
As Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and
Bathilda, he slipped the silver-framed photograph of the unknown
thief inside his jacket.
The stairs were steep and narrow; Harry was half tempted to
place his hands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that she
did not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only
too likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper
landing, turned immediately right, and led him into a low-ceilinged
338
Bathilda’s Secret
bedroom.
It was pitch-black and smelled horrible. Harry had just made
out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda
closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness.
“Lumos,” said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start;
Bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness,
and he had not heard her approach.
“You are Potter?” she whispered.
“Yes, I am.”
She nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating
fast, faster than his own heart. It was an unpleasant, agitating
sensation.
“Have you got anything for me?” Harry asked, but she seemed
distracted by his lit wand-tip.
“Have you got anything for me?” he repeated.
Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once:
Harry’s scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the
front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved
momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice:
Hold him!
Harry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling room
seemed to close around him again; he did not know what had just
happened.
“Have you got anything for me?” he asked for a third time,
much louder.
“Over here,” she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry
raised his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table
beneath the curtained window.
This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and
the unmade bed, his wand raised. He did not want to look away
339
Chapter 17
from her.
“What is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing table, which
was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.
“There,” she said, pointing at the shapeless mass.
And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the
tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: He was
it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror
paralyzed him and he saw the old body collapsing and the great
snake pouring from the place where he neck had been.
The snake struck as he raised his wand. The force of the bite to
his forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light
swung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished. Then a
powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out
of him. He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound
of filthy clothing—
He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake’s tail, which
thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier.
Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor.
From below he heard Hermione call, “Harry?”
He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back. Then
a heavy smooth mass smashed him into the floor and he felt it slide
over him, powerful, muscular.
“No!” he gasped, pinned to the floor.
“Yes,” whispered the voice. “Yesss . . . hold you . . . hold
you . . . ”
“Accio . . . Accio Wand . . . ”
But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force
the snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso, squeezing the
air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a circle of ice
that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his
340
Bathilda’s Secret
brain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated,
his own breath drowned, distant footsteps, everything going . . .
A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was
flying, flying with triumph in his heart, without need of broomstick
or thestral. . . .
He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini
had released him. He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined
against the landing light. It struck, and Hermione dived aside
with a shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which
shattered. Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid
another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like
something—his wand—
He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the
snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for
a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang
and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking
Harry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to
the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so his scar seared
more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years.
“He’s coming! Hermione, he’s coming!”
As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos;
It smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he
knew to be Hermione.
She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed. The
snake reared again, but Harry knew that worse than the snake was
coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to
split open with pain from his scar.
The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione
with him; as it struck, Hermione scream, “Confringo!” and her
341
Chapter 17
spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and
ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry
felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek
as, pulling Hermione one with him, he leapt from bed to broken
dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into
nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they
twisted in midair.
And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was
running across the fetid bedroom, his long white hands clutching
at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman
twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled
with the girl’s, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church
bells ringing in Christmas Day.
And his scream was Harry’s scream, his pain was Harry
pain . . . that it could happen here, where it had happened
before . . . here, within sight of that house where he had come so
close to knowing what it was to die . . . to die. . . . The pain was so
terrible . . . ripped from his body. . . . But if he had no body, why
did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how could he feel so
unbearably, didn’t pain cease with death, didn’t it go—
The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square, and the shop window covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trapping of a world in which they did
not believe. . . . And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and
power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions. . . . Not anger. . . . that was for weaker souls than he . . . but
triumph, yes. . . . He had waited for this, he had hoped for it. . . .
“Nice costume, mister!”
He saw the small boy’s smile falter as he ran near enough to see
beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face.
342
Bathilda’s Secret
Then the child turned and ran away. . . . Beneath the robe be fingered
the hand of his wand . . . One simple movement and the child would
never reach his mother . . . but unnecessary, quite unnecessary. . . .
And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, the Fidelius Charm broken, though
they did not know it yet. . . . And he made less noise than the dead
leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark
hedge, and peered over it. . . .
They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in
their little sitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses,
making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child
was laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small
fist. . . .
A door opened and the mother entered, saying words he could
not hear, her long dark-red hair falling over her face. Now the
father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother. He threw
his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning. . . .
The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter
did no hear. His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak
and pointed it at the door, which burst open.
He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall.
It was easy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand . . .
“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him
off !”
Hold him off, without a wand in his hand?. . . . He laughed before
casting the curse. . . .
“Avada Kedavra!”
The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed
against the wall, it made the banisters glare like lightning rods, and
343
Chapter 17
James Potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut. . . .
He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but
as long as she was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear. . . . He
climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to
barricade herself in. . . . She had no wand either. . . . How stupid they
were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends,
that weapons could be discarded even for moments. . . .
He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily
piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand . . . and there she
stood, the child in her arms. At the last sight of him, she dropped
her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this
would help, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen
instead. . . .
“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!”
“Stand aside, you silly girl . . . stand aside now.”
“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead—”
“This is my last warning—”
“Not Harry! Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . . Not
Harry! Not Harry! Please— I’ll do anything— ”
“Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!”
He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more
prudent to finish them all. . . .
The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like
her husband. The child had not cried all this time. He could stand,
clutching the bars of his crib and he looked up into the intruder’s
face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his
father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty light, and his
mother would pop up any moment, laughing—
He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy’s face. He
wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable
344
Bathilda’s Secret
danger. The child began to cry. It had seen that he was not James.
He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach the
small ones whining in the orphanage—
“Avada Kedavra!”
And then he broke; He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror,
and he must hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined house,
where the child was trapped and screaming, but far away . . . far
away . . .
“No,” he moaned.
The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed
the boy, and yet he was the boy . . .
“No . . . ”
And now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda’s house,
immersed in memories of his greatest loss, and at his feet the great
snake slithered over broken china and glass . . . He looked down and
saw something . . . something incredible . . .
“No . . . ”
“Harry, it’s all right, you’re all right.”
He stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There
he was, the unknown thief he was seeking. . . .
“No . . . I dropped it . . . I dropped it . . . ”
“Harry, it’s okay, wake up, wake up!”
He was Harry . . . Harry, not Voldemort . . . and the thing that
was rustling was not a snake . . . He opened his eyes.
“Harry,” Hermione whispered. “Do you feel all— all right?”
“Yes,” he lied.
He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a
heap of blankets. He could tell that it was almost dawn by the
stillness and the quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas
ceiling. He was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets
345
Chapter 17
and blankets.
“We got away.”
“Yes,” said Hermione, “I had to use a Hover Charm to get
you into your bunk, I couldn’t lift you. You’ve been . . . Well, you
haven’t been quite . . . ”
There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed
a small sponge in her hand. She had been wiping his face.
“You’ve been ill,” she finished, “Quite ill.”
“How long ago did we leave?”
“Hours ago. It’s nearly morning.”
“And I’ve been . . . what, unconscious?”
“Not exactly,” said Hermione uncomfortable, “You’ve been
shouting and moaning and . . . things,” she added in a tone that
made Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed curses like
Voldemort, cried like the baby in the crib?
“I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you,” Hermione said, and he
knew she wanted to change the subject. “It was stuck, stuck to
your chest. You’ve got a mark; I’m sorry, I had to use a Severing
Charm to get it away. The snake bit you too, but I’ve cleaned the
wound and put some dittany on it.”
He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself
and looked down. There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the
locket had burned him. He could also see the half-healed puncture
marks to his forearm.
“Where’ve you put the Horcrux?”
“In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.”
He lay back on his pillow and looked into her pinched gray face.
“We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow. It’s my fault, it’s
all my fault, Hermione, I’m sorry.”
346
Bathilda’s Secret
“It’s not your fault, I wanted to go too, I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword there for you.”
“Yeah, well. . . . we got that wrong, didn’t we?”
“What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you
upstairs? Was the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out
and kill her and attack you?”
“No,” he said. “She was the snake . . . or the snake was
her . . . all along.”
“W—what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him.
It made the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was
inside her. You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to
wait. You were right. He knew I’d go back.”
“The snake was inside her?”
He opened his eyes again. Hermione looked revolted, nauseated. “Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,”
Harry said, “She didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was
Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I
could understand her. One we were up in the room, the snake sent
a message to You-Know-Who. I heard it happen inside my head,
I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . . and then. . . .”
He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda’s neck; Hermione did not need to know the details.
“ . . . she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked.”
He looked down at the puncture marks.
“It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till YouKnow-Who came.”
If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been
worth it, all of it . . . Sick at heart, he sat up threw back the covers.
347
Chapter 17
“Harry, no, I’m sure you ought to rest!”
“You’re the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look
terrible. I’m fine. I’ll keep watch for a while. Where’s my wand?”
She did not answer, she merely looked at him.
“Where’s my wand, Hermione?”
She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes.
“Harry . . . ”
“Where’s my wand?”
She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him.
The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One
fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together.
The wood had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his
hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible
injury. He could not think properly. Everything was a blur of panic
and fear. Then he held out the wand to Hermione.
“Mend it. Please.”
“Harry, I don’t think, when its broken like this— ”
“Please, Hermione, try!”
“R-Reparo.”
The handling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry held it up.
“Lumos!”
The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at
Hermione.
“Expelliarmus!”
Hermione’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand.
The feeble attempt at magic was too much for Harry’s wand, which
split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what
he was seeing . . . the wand that had survived so much . . .
“Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear
her. “I’m so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving,
348
Bathilda’s Secret
you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting
Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have—must have
hit— ”
“It was an accident,” said Harry mechanically. He felt empty,
stunned. “We’ll—we’ll find a way to repair it.”
“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said Hermione,
the tears trickling down her face. “Remember . . . remember Ron?
When he broke his want, crashing the car? It was never the same
again, he had to get a new one.”
Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by
Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who was dead. How was he supposed
to find himself a new wand?
“Well,” he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, “well, I’ll just
borrow yours for now, then. While I keep watch.”
Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand,
and he left her sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than
to get away from her.

he sun was coming up: The pure, colorless vastness
of the sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and
his suffering. Harry sat down in the tent entrance and
took a deep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to
watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have
been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate
it: His senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his wand.
He looked out over a valley blanketed in snow, distant church bells
chiming through the glittering silence.
Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as
if he were trying to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own
blood more times than he could count; he had lost all the bones
in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars
to his chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead,
but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally
350
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore
weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his
magical power had been torn from him. He knew exactly what
Hermione would say if he expressed any of this: The wand is only
as good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different.
She had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass and
shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of
the twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realize how
much he had been counting upon it.
He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and,
without looking at them, tucked them away in Hagrid’s pouch
around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and useless
objects to take any more. Harry’s hand brushed the old Snitch
through the moleskin and for a moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful,
useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind—
And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava,
scorching him inside, wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer
desperation they had talked themselves into believing that Godric’s Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were
supposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out
for them by Dumbledore; but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with
unknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided. Nothing
was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and
now, Harry had no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of
the thief, and it would surely be easy now for Voldemort to find
out who he was. . . . Voldemort had all the information now. . . .
“Harry?”
Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her
351
Chapter 18
own wand. Her face streaked with tears, she crouched down beside
him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky
under her arm.
“Thanks,” he said, taking one of the cups.
“Do you mind if I talk to you?”
“No,” he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings.
“Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was.
Well . . . I’ve got the book.”
Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life
and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.
“Where—how—?”
“It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note
was sticking out of the top of it.”
Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud,
“Dear Batty, Thanks for the help. Here’s a copy of the book,
hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don’t remember
it, Rita. I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was
alive, but perhaps she wasn’t in any fit state to read it?”
“No, she probably wasn’t.”
Harry looked down upon Dumbledore’s face and experienced a
surge of savage pleasure: Now he would know all the things that
Dumbledore had never thought it was worth telling him, whether
Dumbledore wanted him to or not.
“You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said Hermione;
he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew
that his anger must have shown in his face.
“No,” he said quietly. “No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out of there, and you were incredible. I’d be dead if you hadn’t been there to help me.”
352
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore
He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention
to the book. Its spine was stiff; it had clearly never been opened
before. He riffled through the pages, looking for photographs. He
came across the one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter at some
long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption:
Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother’s death
with his friend Gellert Grindelwald.
Harry gasped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend Grindelwald. He looked sideways at Hermione,
who was still contemplating the name as though she could not
believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry.
“Grindelwald?”
Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the
pages around them for a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon
discovered it and read greedily, but became lost: It was necessary
to go farther back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found
himself at the start of a chapter entitled “The Greater Good.”
Together, he and Hermione started to read:
Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left
Hogwarts in a blaze of glory—Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional SpellCasting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot,
Gold Medal-Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the
International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias “Dogbreath”
Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick he had picked up
at school.
353
Chapter 18
The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in
London, preparing to depart for Greece the following morning,
when an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore’s mother’s
death. “Dogbreath” Doge, who refused to be interviewed for
this book, has given the public his own sentimental version of
what happened next. He represents Kendra’s death as a tragic
blow, and Dumbledore’s decision to give up his expedition as
an act of noble self-sacrifice.
Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric’s Hollow at
once, supposedly to “care” for his younger brother and sister. But how much care did he actually give them?
“He were a head case, that Aberforth,” said Enid Smeek,
whose family lived on the outskirts of Godric’s Hollow at that
time. “Ran wild. ’Course, with his mum and dad gone you’d
have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at
my head. I don’t think Albus was fussed about him, I never
saw them together, anyway.”
So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young
brother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For, though her first jailer had died,
there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her very existence continued to be known only to those
few outsiders who, like “Dogbreath” Doge could be counted
upon to believe in the story of her “ill health.”
Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated magical historian who has lived
in Godric’s Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, had
rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the
family to the village. Several years later, however, the author
354
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore
sent an owl to Albus at Hogwarts, having been favorably impressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in Transfiguration Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with
the entire Dumbledore family. At the time of Kendra’s death,
Bathilda was the only person in Godric’s Hollow who was on
speaking terms with Dumbledore’s mother.
Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed. “The fire’s lit, but the
cauldron’s empty,” as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in
Enid Smeek’s slightly earthier phrase, “She’s nutty as squirrel
poo.” Nevertheless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard
fact to string together the whole scandalous story.
Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts
Kendra’s premature death down to a backfiring charm, a story
repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also
parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her “frail” and “delicate.” On one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the
effort I put in procuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone,
knows the full story of the best-kept story of Albus Dumbledore’s life. Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of of Dumbledore:
his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the
oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family.
The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric’s Hollow, now an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda
Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her great-nephew,
Gellert Grindelwald.
The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most
355
Chapter 18
Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on
the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended
his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his
rise to power are not widely known here.
Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its
unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed
himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather
than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and
prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other
pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could
no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert
Grindelwald, and he was expelled.
Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald’s next
movements is that he “traveled abroad for some months.” It
can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his greataunt in Godric’s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking
though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close
friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore.
“He seemed a charming boy to me,” babbles Bathilda,
“whatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him to
poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own
age. The boys took to each other at once.”
They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by
her, that Albus Dumbledore send Gellert Grindelwald in the
dead of night.
“Yes, even after they’d spent all day in discussion—both
such brilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire—
I’d sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert’s bedroom win356
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore
dow, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck
him, and then he had to let Gellert know immediately!”
And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though
Albus Dumbledore’s fans will find it, here are the thoughts of
their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best friend.
(A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.)
Gellert—
Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR
THE MUGGLES’ OWN GOOD— this, I think is
the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power
and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it
also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. We must
stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon
which we build. Where we are opposed, as we surely
will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER
GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet
resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had
not been expelled, we would never have met.)
Albus
Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will
be, this letter constitutes proof that Albus Dumbledore once
dreamed of overthrowing the Statute of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those
who have always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-borns’
greatest champion! How hollow those speeches promoting
Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence!
357
Chapter 18
How despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he should have been mourning his
mother and caring for his sister!
No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his
crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not, after all, put
his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of
heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems
altogether more shocking.
Barely two months into their great new friendship. Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again
until they met for their legendary dual (for more, see chapter
22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore
come to his senses? Had he told Grindelwald he wanted no
more part in his plans? Alas, no.
“It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,” says
Bathilda. “It came as an awful shock. Gellert was there in
the house when it happened, and he came back to my house
all of a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next day.
Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and
that was the last I saw of him.
“Albus was beside himself at Ariana’s death. It was so
dreadful for those two brothers. They had lost everybody except each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these
dreadful circumstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus’s nose at
the funeral was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra
to see her sons fighting like that, across her daughter’s body.
A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. . . . He
358
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore
would have been a comfort to Albus, at least. . . .”
This dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few
who attended Ariana Dumbledore’s funeral, raises several
questions. Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus for his sister’s death? Was it, as “Batty” pretends, a mere
effusion of grief? Or could there have been some more concrete
reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang
for near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country
hours after the girl’s death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?)
never saw him again, not until forced to do so by the pleas of
the Wizarding world.
Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seem to have
referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. However,
there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some
five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his attack
upon Grindelwald. Was it a lingering affection for the man or
fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set
out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met?
And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the
inadvertent victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble across
something she ought not to have done, as the two young men
sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is
it possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the first person to die
“for the greater good”?
The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had
reached the bottom of the page before him. She tugged the book
out of Harry’s hands, looking a little alarmed by his expression,
and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something
359
Chapter 18
indecent.
“Harry— ”
But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down
inside him; it was exactly as he had felt after Ron left. He had
trusted Dumbledore, believed him the embodiment of goodness
and wisdom. All was ashes: How much more could he lose? Ron,
Dumbledore, the phoenix wand . . . “Harry.” She seemed to have
heard his thoughts. “Listen to me. It—it doesn’t make very nice
reading— ”
“Yeah, you could say that— ”
“—but don’t forget, Harry this is Rita Skeeter writing.”
“You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn’t you?”
“Yes, I— I did.” She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea
in her cold hands. “I think that’s the worst bit. I know Bathilda
thought it was all just talk, bur ‘For the Greater Good’ became
Grindelwald’s slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave
him the idea. They say ‘For the Greater Good’ was even carved
over the entrance to Nurmengard.”
“What’s Nurmengard?”
“The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He
ended up in there himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it’s—it’s an awful thought that Dumbledore’s ideas helped
Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can’t
pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one
summer when they were both really young, and— ”
“I thought you’d say that,” said Harry. He did not want to let
his anger spill out at her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady.
“I thought you’d say ‘They were young.’ They were the same age
360
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore
as we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the
Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend,
plotting their rise to power over the Muggles.”
His temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood
up and walked around, trying to work some of it off.
“I’m not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,” said Hermione. “All that ‘right to rule’ rubbish, it’s ‘Magic Is Might’ all
over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck
alone in the house— ”
“Alone? He wasn’t alone! He had his brother and sister for
company, his Squib sister he was keeping locked up— ”
“I don’t believe it,” said Hermione. She stood up too. “Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib. The
Dumbledore we know would never, ever have allowed— ”
“The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer
Muggles by force!” Harry shouted, his voice echoing across the
empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, squawking
and spiraling against the pearly sky.
“He changed, Harry, he changed! It’s as simple as that! Maybe
he did believe those things when he was seventeen, but the whole
of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always
voted for Muggle protection and Muggle born rights, who fought
You-Know-Who from the start, and who died trying to bring him
down!”
Rita’s book lay on the ground between them, so that the face
of Albus Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both.
“Harry, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so angry is
that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself.”
361
Chapter 18
“Maybe I am!” Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his
head, hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or
protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. “Look
what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And
again! And again! And don’t expect me to explain everything,
just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m doing, trust me
even though I don’t trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!”
His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at
each other in the whiteness and the emptiness, and Harry felt they
were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky.
“He loved you,” Hermione whispered. “I know he loved you.”
Harry dropped his arms.
“I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me.
This isn’t love, the mess he’s left me in. He shared a damn sight
more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than
he ever shared with me.”
Harry picked up Hermione’s wand, which he dropped in the
snow, and sat back down in the entrance to the tent.
“Thanks for the tea. I’ll finish the watch. You get back in the
warm.”
She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the
book and then walked back past him into the tent, but as she did
so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed
his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she
said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared.
362
Chapter 19
The Silver Doe
I
t was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch
at midnight. Harry’s dreams were confused and disturbing:
Nagini wove in and out of them, first through a gigantic,
cracked ring, then through a wreath of Christmas roses. He
woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out
to him in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around
the tent was footsteps or voices.
Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was
huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by
the light of the wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she
greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving
on.
“We’ll go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, shivering as
she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. “I kept thinking I
could hear people moving outside, I even thought I saw somebody
once or twice.”
Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at
the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table.
363
Chapter 19
“I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking nervous. “The
snow in the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes. . . . But perhaps we
ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?”
Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry was wearing
the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry’s feet parted
company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what
felt like frozen earth covered with leaves.
“Where are we?” he asked, peering around at a fresh mass of
trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging at
tent poles.
“The Forest of Dean,” she said. “‘I came camping here once
with my mum and dad.”
Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly
cold, but they were at least protected from the wind. They spent
most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around the
useful bright blue flames that Hermione was so adept at producing,
and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar. Harry
felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness; an impression reinforced by Hermione’s solicitousless. That
afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their
sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow.
After two nights of little sleep, Harry’s senses seemed more alert
than usual. Their escape from Godric’s Hollow had been so narrow
that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more threatening. As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione’s offer
to keep watch and told her to go to bed.
Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down,
wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The
364
The Silver Doe
darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually
impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder’s
Map, so as to watch Ginny’s dot for a while, before he remembered
that it was the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at
the Burrow.
Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the
forest. Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but
he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could
separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that
might proclaim other, sinister movements. He remembered the
sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and
at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself.
Their protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should
they break now? And yet he could not throw off the feeling that
something was different tonight.
Several time he jerked upright, he neck aching because he had
fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the
tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he
might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and
Apparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see
whether he could make out his fingers when it happened.
A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving
through the trees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly.
The light seemed simply to drift toward him.
He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised
Hermione’s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became
blinding, the trees in front of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still
the thing came closer. . . .
And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an
365
Chapter 19
oak. It was a silver-white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking
her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in
the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful
head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high.
Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her
strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he
had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until
that moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to
shout for Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had
gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had
come for him, and him alone.
They gazed at each other for several long moments and then
she turned an walked away.
“No,” he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. “Come
back!”
She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon
her brightness was striped by their think black trunks. For one
trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a
trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him
that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit.
Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as
she passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper
and deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked quickly,
sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her
properly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him
what he needed to know.
At last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head
toward him once more, and he broke into a run, a question burning
in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished.
366
The Silver Doe
Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished
image was still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision,
brightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now
fear came: Her presence had meant safety.
“Lumos!” he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited.
The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes
as he stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant
crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining
that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching
him?
He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out him, no flash of green
light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this
spot?
Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun
about, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked
black surface glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it.
He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The
ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but
deep below the thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted.
A great silver cross . . .
His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at
the pool’s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the
pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red . . . It was a
sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. . . . The sword of Gryffindor
was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.
Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible?
How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to
the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic
367
Chapter 19
drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken
to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had
the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely
because they were here? In which case, where was the person who
had wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at
the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline,
for the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the
same, a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned
his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen
pool.
He pointed the want at the silvery shape and murmured, “Accio
Sword.”
It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that
easy, the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up,
not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle
of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered
itself to him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked
for help.
“Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool
bottom, indifferent, motionless.
What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only
a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what
were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside
Harry’s head answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set
Gryffindors apart.
Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath
dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to
do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to
368
The Silver Doe
this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.
He glanced at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced
that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as
he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity
as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point
was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting.
With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers
of clothing. Where “chivalry” entered this, he thought ruefully, he
was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was
not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.
An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought
with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip of until at last he
stood there in is underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed
the pouch containing his wand, his mother’s letter, the shard of
Sirius’s mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he
pointed Hermione’s wand at the ice.
“Diffindo.”
It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence. The surface
of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water.
As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the
sword he would have to submerge himself completely.
Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the
water warmer. He stepped to the pool’s edge and placed Hermione’s wand on the ground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine
how much colder he was about to become or how violently he would
soon be shivering, he jumped.
Every pore of his body screamed in protest; The very air in his
lungs seems to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in
369
Chapter 19
the frozen water. He could hardly breathe; trembling so violently,
the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade
with his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once.
Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to
second, gasping and shaking, until he told himself that it must be
done, gathered all his courage, and dived.
The cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His brain itself
seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the
bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers closed
around the hilt; he pulled it upward.
Then something closed tight around his neck. He though of water weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised
his empty hand to free himself. It was not weed: The chain of the
Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe.
Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the
surface, but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the
pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain,
his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were
popping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was
nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around
his chest were surely Death’s. . . .
Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever
been in his life, he came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere
close by, another person was panting and coughing and staggering
around. Hermione had come again, as she had come when the
snake attacked. . . . Yet it did not sound like her, not with those
deep coughs, not judging by the weight of the footsteps. . . .
Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior’s identity. All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and
370
The Silver Doe
feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was
gone. Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from
over his head,
“Are—you—mental?”
Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given
Harry the strength to get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to
his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched
to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor
in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the
other.
“What the hell,” panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which
swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody
of hypnosis, “didn’t you take this thing off before you dived?”
Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing
compared with Ron’s reappearance: he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the
water’s edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater
after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting
him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet
he had to be real: He had just dived into the pool; he had saved
Harry’s life.
“It was y—you?” Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his
voice weaker than usual due to his near-strangulation.
“Well, yeah,” said Ron, looking slightly confused.
“Y—you cast that doe?”
“What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!”
“My Patronus is a stag.”
“Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.”
Harry put Hagrid’s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a
371
Chapter 19
final sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione’s wand, and faced Ron
again.
“How come you’re here?”
Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later,
if at all.
“Well, I’ve—you know— I’ve come back. If— ” He cleared his
throat. “You know. You still want me.”
There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron’s departure
seemed to rise like a wall between them. Yet he was here. He had
returned. He had just saved Harry’s life.
Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding.
“Oh yeah, I got it out,” he said, rather unnecessarily, holding
up the sword for Harry’s inspection. “That’s why you jumped in,
right?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “But I don’t understand. How did you get
here? How did you find us?”
“Long story,” said Ron. “I’ve been looking for you for hours,
it’s a big forest, isn’t it? And I was just thinking I’d have to kip
under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming
and you following.”
“You didn’t see anyone else?”
“No,” said Ron, “I— ”
But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together
some yards away.
“I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running
to the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come
up, so I wasn’t going to make a detour to—hey!”
Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated.
372
The Silver Doe
The two oaks grew together: there was a gap of only a few inches
between the trunks at eye level, and ideal place to see but not be
seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and
Harry could see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron
stood waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux.
“Anything there?” Ron asked.
“No,” said Harry.
“So how did the sword ever get into that pool?”
“Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.”
They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt
glinting a little in the light from Hermione’s wand.
“You reckon this is the real one?” asked Ron.
“One way to find out, isn’t there?” said Harry.
The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron’s hand. The locket
was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the ting inside it was
agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had
tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not
the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy the
locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione’s
wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow
of a sycamore tree.
“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from
the rock’s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When
Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head.
“No, you should do it.”
“Me?” said Ron, looking shocked. “Why?”
“Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s supposed to be you.”
He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had
373
Chapter 19
known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the
one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry
something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power
of certain acts.
“I’m going to open it,” said Harry, “and you stab it. Straightaway, okay? Because whatever’s in there will put up a fight. The
bit of Riddle in the diary tried to kill me.”
“Hou are you going to open it?” asked Ron. He looked terrified.
“I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said Harry.
The answer came so readily to his lips that he thought he had
always known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the
serpentine S inlaid with glittering green stones: It was easy to
visualize it as a minuscule snake, curled upon the cold rock.
“No!” said Ron. “No, don’t open it! I’m serious!”
“Why not?” asked Harry. “Let’s get rid of the damn thing, it’s
been months— ”
“Because that thing’s bad for me!” said Ron, backing away
from the locket on the rock. “I can’t handle it! I’m not making
excuses, Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than
it affected you and Hermione, it made me think stuff— stuff I was
thinking anyway, but it made everything worse. I can’t explain
it, and then I’d take it off and I’d get my head on straight again,
and then I’d have to put the effing thing back on— I can’t do it,
Harry!”
He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking
his head.
“You can do it,” said Harry. “You can! You’ve just got the
sword, I know it’s supposed to be you who uses it. Please, just get
374
The Silver Doe
rid of it, Ron.”
The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron
swallowed, then, still breathing hard through his long nose, moved
back toward the rock.
“Tell me when,” he croaked.
“On three,” said Harry, looking back down at the locket and
narrowing his eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut
around Harry’s neck still burned.
“One . . . two . . . three . . . open.”
The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors
of the locket swung wide with a little click.
Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye,
dark and handsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes had been before he turned
them scarlet and slit-pupiled.
“Stab,” said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock.
Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled
over the frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket
tightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from the
empty windows.
Then a voice hissed out from the Horcrux.
“I have seen your heart, and it is mine.”
“Don’t listen to it!” Harry said harshly. “Stab it!”
“I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen
your fears. All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also
possible. . . . ”
“Stab!” shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the surrounding
trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle’s
375
Chapter 19
eyes.
“Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a
daughter . . . Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your
friend . . . Second best, always, eternally overshadowed . . . ”
“Ron, stab it now!” Harry bellowed; He could feel the locket
quivering in his grip and was scared of what was coming. Ron
raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle’s eyes gleamed
scarlet.
Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed,
like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione,
weirdly distorted.
Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed
out of the locket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they
stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root,
swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers
away from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot.
“Ron!” he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking
with Voldemort’s voice and Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into his
face.
“Why return? We were better without you, happier without
you, glad of your absence. . . . We laughed at your stupidity, your
cowardice, your presumption—”
“Presumption!” echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more
beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione. She
swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified yet transfixed,
the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. “Who could look at you,
who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you
ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?”
376
The Silver Doe
“Ron, stab it, STAB IT!” Harry yelled, but Ron did not move.
His eyes were wide, and the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione
were reflected in them, their hair swirling like flames, their eyes
shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet.
“You mother confessed,” sneered Riddle-Harry, while RiddleHermione jeered, “that she would have preferred me as a son, would
be glad to exchange . . . ”
“Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you
are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned Riddle-Hermione,
and she stretched like a snake and engulfed herself around RiddleHarry, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met.
On the ground in front of them, Ron’s face filled with anguish.
He raised the sword high, his arms shaking.
“Do it, Ron!” Harry yelled.
Ron looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of
scarlet in his eyes.
“Ron—?”
The sword flashed, plunged; Harry threw himself out of the way,
there was a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream. Harry
whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend
himself: but there was nothing to fight.
The monstrous version of himself and Hermione were gone;
There was only Ron, standing there with the sword held slackly in
his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on
the flat rock.
Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say
or do. Ron was breathing heavily: His eyes were no longer red at
all, but their normal blue; they were also wet.
Harry stopped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the
377
Chapter 19
broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle’s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was
smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had
vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act.
The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees,
his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from
cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down
beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took
it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.
“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that
Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer,
only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when
we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . . ”
He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again
that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them.
“She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and
I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like
that, I thought you knew.”
Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and
wiped his nose on his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked
to where Ron’s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as
Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He
hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise
composed.
“I’m sorry,” he said in a thick voice. “I’m sorry I left. I know I
was a— a— ”
He looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough
world would swoop down upon him and claim him.
378
The Silver Doe
“You’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said Harry. “Getting
the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. Saving my life.”
“That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,” Ron mumbled.
“Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,” said
Harry. “I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.”
Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron’s jacket.
“And now,” said Harry as they broke apart, “all we’ve got to
do is find the tent again.”
But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark
forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with Ron my his side
the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry
could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with a quickening
excitement that he entered the tent. Ron lagging a little behind
him.
It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only
illumination through the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl
on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times.
“Hermione!”
She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her
face.
“What’s wrong? Harry? Are you all right?”
“It’s okay, everything’s fine. More than fine. I’m great. There’s
someone here.”
“What do you mean? Who—?”
She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping
onto the threadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner,
slipped off Ron’s rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the
379
Chapter 19
canvas.
Hermione slipped out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker
toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale face. She stopped right in front
of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak,
hopeful smile and half raised his arms.
Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every
inch of him that she could reach.
“Ouch— ow— gerroff! What the—? Hermione—OW!”
“You—complete—arse —Ronald—Weasley!”
She punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away,
shielding his head as Hermione advanced.
“You—crawl—back—here— after—weeks— and—weeks—
oh, where’s my wand?”
She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry’s hands
and he reacted instinctively.
“Protego!!”
The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The
force of it knocked her backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out
of her mouth, she leapt up again.
“Hermione!” said Harry. “Calm— ”
“I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before had he
seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. “Give
me back my wand! Give it back to me!”
“Hermione, will you please— ”
“Don’t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!” she screeched.
“Don’t you dare! Give it back now! And YOU!”
She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a malediction, and Harry could not blame Ron for retreating several steps.
“I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come
380
The Silver Doe
back!”
“I know,” Ron said. “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really— ”
“Oh you’re sorry!”
She laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked
at Harry for help, but Harry merely grimaced his helplessness.
“You come back after weeks—weeks — and you think it’s all
going to be all right if you just say sorry?”
“Well, what else can I say?” Ron shouted, and Harry was glad
that Ron was fighting back.
“Oh, I don’t know!” yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm.
“Rack your brains, Ron, that should only take a couple of
seconds— ”
“Hermione,” interjected Harry who considered this a low blow,
“he just saved my— ”
“I don’t care!” she screamed. “I don’t care what he’s done!
Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for all he knew— ”
“I knew you weren’t dead!” bellowed Ron, drowning her voice
for the first time, and approaching as close as he could with the
Shield Charm between them. “Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over
the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and
mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you
don’t know what it’s been like— ”
“What it’s been like for you?”
Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it
soon, but she had reached a new level of indignation that rendered
her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his opportunity.
“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated, but I
walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn’t
go anywhere!”
381
Chapter 19
“A gang of what?” asked Harry, as Hermione thew herself down
into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so rightly it seemed
unlikely that she would unravel them for several years.
“Snatchers,” said Ron. “They’re everywhere— gangs trying to
earn gold by rounding up Muggle-borns and blood traitors, there’s
a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured. I was on my
own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited,
thought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get
out of being dragged to the Ministry.”
“What did you say to them?”
“Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think
of.”
“And they believed that?”
“They weren’t the brightest. One of them was definitely parttroll, the smell off him. . . .”
Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at
this small instance of humor, but her expression remained stony
above her tightly knotted limbs.
“Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It
was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them
and only one of me and they’d taken my wand. Then two of them
got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to
hit the one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, disarmed
the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. I didn’t do it so well.
Splinched myself again”—Ron held up his right hand to show two
missing fingernails; Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly— “and I
came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to
that bit of riverbank where we’d been . . . you’d gone.”
“Gosh, what a gripping story,” Hermione said in the lofty voice
382
The Silver Doe
she adopted when wishing to wound. “You must have been simply
terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric’s Hollow and, let’s think
what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who’s snake
turned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who
himself arrived and missed us by about a second.”
“What?” Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione
ignored him.
“Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective doesn’t it?”
“Hermione,” said Harry quietly. “Ron just saved my life.”
She appeared not to have heard him.
“One thing I would like to know, though,” she said, fixing her
eyes on a spot a foot over Ron’s head. “How exactly did you find
us tonight? That’s important. Once we know, we’ll be able to
make sure we’re not visited by anyone else we don’t want to see.”
Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his
jeans pocket.
“This.”
She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.
“The Deluminator?” she asked, so surprised she forgot to look
cold and fierce.
“It doesn’t just turn the lights on and off,” said Ron. “I don’t
know how it works or why it happened then and not any other
time, because I’ve been wanting to come back ever since I left.
But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning
and I heard . . . I heard you.”
He was looking at Hermione.
“You heard me on the radio?” she asked incredulously.
“No. I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,” he
383
Chapter 19
held up the Deluminator again, “came out of this.”
“And what exactly did I say?” asked Hermione, her tone somewhere between skepticism and curiosity.
“My name. ‘Ron.’ And you said . . . something about a
wand. . . .”
Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered. It
had been the first time Ron’s name had been said aloud by either
of them since the day he had left; Hermione had mentions it when
talking about repairing Harry’s wand.
“So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator,
“and it didn’t seem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard
you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but
another light appeared right outside my window.”
Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes
focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see.
“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that like
you get around a Portkey, you know?”
“Yeah,” said Harry and Hermione together automatically.
“I knew this was it,” said Ron. “I grabbed my stuff and packed
it then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden.
“The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and
when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the
shed and then it . . . well, it went inside me.”
“Sorry?” said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly.
“It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, “right into my chest, and then—it
just went straight through. It was here,” he touched a point close
to his heart. “I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside
me I knew where I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me
384
The Silver Doe
where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side
of a hill. There was snow everywhere. . . .”
“We were there,” said Harry. “We spend two nights there,
and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving
around in the dark and calling out!”
“Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron. “Your protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn’t see you and I couldn’t
hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got
in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought
you’d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.”
“No, actually,” said Hermione. “We’ve been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early, because as Harry says, we’d heard somebody blundering
around.”
“Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron. “I kept hoping
you’d appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have
missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came
out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in
these woods. I still couldn’t see you, so I just had to hope one of
you would show yourselves in the end— and Harry did. Well, I saw
the doe first, obviously.”
“You saw the what?” said Hermione sharply.
They explained what had happened, and as the story of the
silver doe nad the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned
from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to
keep her limbs locked together.
“But it must have been a Patronus!” she said. “Couldn’t you
see who was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to
the sword! I can’t believe this! Then what happened?”
385
Chapter 19
Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool
and had waited for him to resurface; how he had realized that
something was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, then returned
for the sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then
hesitated, and Harry cut in.
“— and Ron stabbed it with the sword.”
“And . . . it went? Just like that?” she whispered.
“Well, it— screamed,” said Harry with half a glance at Ron.
“Here.”
He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and
examined its punctured windows.
Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the
Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione’s wand and turned to Ron.
“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare
wand?”
“What?” said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. “Oh— oh yeah.”
He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short,
dark wand out of its pocket. “Here. I figured it’s always handy to
have a backup.”
“You were right,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “Mine’s
broken.”
“You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got
to her feet, and he looked apprehensive again.
Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag,
then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another
word.
Ron passed Harry the new wand.
“About the best you could hope for, I think,” murmured Harry.
386
The Silver Doe
“Yeah,” said Ron. “Could’ve been worse. Remember those
birds she set on me?”
“I still haven’t ruled it out,” came Hermione’s muffled voice
from beneath her blankets, but Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as
he pulled his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack.
387
Chapter 20
Xenophilius Lovegood
H
arry had not expected Hermione’s anger to abate
overnight, and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences
the next morning. Ron responded by maintaining an
unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of
continuing remorse. In fact, when all three of them were together
Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral.
During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however
(collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms),
Ron became shamelessly cheery.
“Someone helped us.” he kept saying. “Someone sent that doe.
Someone’s on our side. One Horcrux down, mate!”
Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating
the possible locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they
had discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione’s
sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits; The sudden upswing in
their fortunes, they appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery
388
Xenophilius Lovegood
of Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, Ron’s return, made Harry so
happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.
Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione’s baleful
presence again, and under the pretense of scouting the bare hedges
for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange
of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of
his and Hermione’s various wanderings, right up to the full story of
what had happened at Godric’s Hollow; Ron was now filling Harry
in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding
world during his weeks away.
“ . . . and how did you find out about the Taboo?” he asked
Harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggleborns to evade the Ministry.
“The what?”
“You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who’s
name!”
“Oh, yeah. Well, it’s just a bad habit we’ve slipped into,” said
Harry. “But I haven’t got a problem calling him V— ”
“NO!” roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and
Hermione (nose buried in a boot at the tent entrance) to scowl
over at them. “Sorry.” said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the
brambles, “but the name’s been jinxed. Harry, that’s how they
track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it
causes some kind of magical disturbance—it’s how they found us
in Totenham Court Road!”
“Because we used his name?”
“Exactly! You’ve got to give them credit, it makes sense. It
was only people who were serious about standing up to him like
Dumbledore, who ever dared use it. Now they’ve put a Taboo on
it, anyone who says it is trackable—quick-and-easy way to find
389
Chapter 20
they Order members! They nearly got Kingsley— ”
“You’re kidding?”
“Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but
he fought his way out. He’s on the run now, just like us.” Ron
scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. “You
don’t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?”
“His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?”
“Oh yeah . . . ”
They moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and
Hermione.
“Harry . . . you don’t reckon it could’ve been Dumbledore?”
“Dumbledore what?”
Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, “Dumbledore . . . the doe? I mean,” Ron was watching Harry out of the
corners of his eyes, “he had the real sword last, didn’t he?”
Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well
the longing behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had
managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them,
would have been inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head.
“Dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw the
body. He’s definitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a phoenix,
not a doe.”
“Patronuses can change, though, can’t they?” said Ron.
“Tonks’s changed, didn’t it?”
“Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn’t he show
himself? Why wouldn’t he just hand us the sword?”
“Search me,” said Ron. “Same reason he didn’t give it to you
while he was alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and
Hermione a book of kids’ stories?”
390
Xenophilius Lovegood
“Which is what?” asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the
face, desperate for the answer.
“I dunno,” said Ron. “Sometimes I’ve thought, when I’ve been
a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or— or he just wanted to
make it more difficult. But I don’t think so, not anymore. He knew
what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he?
He—well,” Ron’s ears turned bright red and he became engrossed
in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe, “he
must’ve known I’d run out on you.”
“No,” Harry corrected him. “He must’ve know you’d always
want to come back.”
Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the
subject, Harry said, “Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard
what Skeeter wrote about him?”
“Oh yeah,” said Ron at once. “people are talking about it quite
a lot. ’Course, if things were different, it’d be huge news. Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it’s just something to
laugh about for people who didn’t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a
slap in the face for everyone who though he was such a good bloke.
I don’t know that it’s such a big deal, though. He was really young
when they— ”
“Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione,
and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing
the subject.
A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles.
Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous
night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and
had decided was made of blackthorn.
“Engorgio.”
The spider game a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web.
391
Chapter 20
Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger.
“Stop that,” said Ron sharply. “I’m sorry I said Dumbledore
was young, okay?”
Harry had forgotten Ron’s hatred of spiders.
“Sorry—Reducio.”
The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that
day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his
phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having
somebody else’s hand sown to the end of his arm.
“You just need to practice,” said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching
anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. “It’s all
a matter of confidence, Harry.”
He knew why she wanted to be right: She still felt guilty about
breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips,
that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no
difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be
friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a
tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once
more.
All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and
Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make
the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic
still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before.
Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many
nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out
of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.
“There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low voice, “that
tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know392
Xenophilius Lovegood
Who’s side and are following the Ministry line, but this one . . . you
wait till you hear it, it’s great. Only they can’t do it every night,
they have to keep changing locations in case they’re raided, and
you need a password to tune in. . . . Trouble is, I missed the last
one. . . .”
He drummed lightly on top of the radio with his wand, muttering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many
covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the
notice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered. Hermione turned the pages
of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn
wand.
Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his
tapping at once.
“If it’s annoying you, I’ll stop!” he told Hermione nervously.
Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry.
“We need to talk,” she said.
He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The
Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.
“What?” he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that
there was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to
hearing Rita’s version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione’s answer, however, was completely unexpected.
“I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.”
He stared at her.
“Sorry?”
“Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna’s father. I want to go and talk to
him!”
“Er—why?”
She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said,
393
Chapter 20
“It’s that mark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!”
She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under
Harry’s unwilling eyes as he saw a photograph of the original letter
than Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore’s familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof
that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had
not been Rita’s invention.
“The signature,” said Hermione. “Look at the signature,
Harry!”
He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking
about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw
that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version
of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle
the Bard.
“Er—what are you—?” said Ron tentatively, but Hermione
quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry.
“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know Viktor
said it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was definitely on that old
grave in Godric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long
before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t ask
Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means— I don’t even know if
Grindelwald’s still alive—but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was
wearing the symbol at the wedding. I’m sure this is important,
Harry!”
Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense,
eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking.
After a long pause he said, “Hermione, we don’t need another
Godric’s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and— ”
“But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore’s left me The
Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you know we’re not supposed to
394
Xenophilius Lovegood
find out about the sign?”
“Here we go again!” Harry felt slightly exasperated. “We keep
trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and
clues— ”
“The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up
Ron. “I think Hermione’s right, I think we ought to go and see
Lovegood.”
Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron’s
support of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the
meaning of the triangular rune.
“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on
your side, Harry, The Quibbler ’s been for you all along, it keeps
telling everyone they’ve got to help you!”
“I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly.
“But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me
about it before he died?”
“Maybe . . . maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself,” said Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws.
“Yea,” said Ron sycophantically, “that makes sense.”
“No, it doesn’t,” snapped Hermione, “but I still think we ought
to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s Hollow? Harry, I’m sure we ought to know
about this!”
“I think we should vote on it,” said Ron. “Those in favor of
going to see Lovegood— ”
His hand flew into the air before Hermione’s. Her lips quivered
suspiciously as she raised her own.
“Outvoted, Harry, sorry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back.
“Fine,” said Harry, half amused, half irritated. “Only, once
we’ve seen Lovegood, let’s try and look for some more Horcruxes,
395
Chapter 20
shall we? Where do the Lovegoods live, anyway? Do either of you
know?”
“Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron.. “I dunno
exactly where, but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills
whenever they mention them. Shouldn’t be hard to find.”
When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his
voice.
“You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.”
“All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and this is a bit
of both. Cheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home!”
They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Cachpole
from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning.
From their high vantage point the village looked like a collection
of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to
earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or
two looking toward the Burrow their hands shadowing their eyes,
but all they could make out were the high hedges and tree of the
orchard, which afforded the crooked little house protection from
Muggle eyes.
“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” said Ron.
“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You were there
for Christmas,” said Hermione coldly.
“I wasn’t at the Burrow!” said Ron with and incredulous laugh.
“Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d
walked out on you? Yeah, and Fred and George would’ve been
great about it. And Ginny, she’d have been really understanding.”
“But where have you been, then?” asked Hermione, surprised.
“Bill and Fleur’s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill’s always been
decent to me. He—he wasn’t impressed when he heard what I’d
done, but he didn’t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry.
396
Xenophilius Lovegood
None of the rest of the family knew I was there. Bill told Mum he
and Fleur weren’t going home for Christmas because they wanted
to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after they were married. I
don’t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina
Warbeck.”
Ron turned his back on the Burrow.
“Let’s try up here,” he said, leading the way over the top of the
hill.
They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione’s insistence,
hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills
appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which
seemed deserted.
“Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?” said Hermione, peering through the window at a neat little
kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. Ron snorted.
“Listen, I’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived there
if you looked through the Lovegood’s window. Let’s try the next
lot of hills.
So they Disapparated a few miles farther north.
“Aha!” shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and
clothes. Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on
which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose
vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly
moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. “That’s got to be
Luna’s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like
a giant rook!”
“It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at the tower.
“I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron. “A castle to you.”
Ron’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill
first. When Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and
397
Chapter 20
clutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly.
“It’s theirs,” said Ron. “Look.”
Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down
gate. The first read,
THE QUIBBLER, EDITOR: X. LOVEGOOD
the second,
PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE
the third,
KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS
The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants,
including a bush covered in the orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff
and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple
trees, beat with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with
berry-sized red fruits and bushy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe,
stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a
slightly flattened, hawklike head peered down at them from one of
the branches.
“You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,” said Hermione. “It’s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us.”
He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the
beaded bag. She then rapped three times on the thick black door,
which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like
an eagle.
Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and
there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair
398
Xenophilius Lovegood
was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper
at Bill and Fleur’s wedding by comparison.
“What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?” he
cried in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione,
then at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open
in a perfect comical O.
“Hello, Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “I’m
Harry, Harry Potter.”
Xenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the eye that
was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on
Harry’s forehead.
“Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry. “There’s
something we’d like to ask you.”
“I . . . I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered Xenophilius.
He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. “Rather a
shock . . . My word . . . I . . . I’m afraid I don’t really think I ought
to— ”
“It won’t take long,” said Harry, slightly disappointed by this
less than warming welcome.
“I— oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!”
They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed
the door shut behind then. They were standing in the most peculiar
kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so
that it felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was
curved to fit the walls— the stove, the sink, and the cupboards—
and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in
bright primary colors. Harry though he recognized Luna’s style:
The effect in such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming.
In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to
the upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging
399
Chapter 20
coming from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.
“You’d better come up,” said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the way.
The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and
workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen.
Though much smaller and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion
that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised
of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon piles of books
and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures
Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung
from the ceiling.
Luna was not there; The thing that was making such a racket
was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels.
It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old
shelves, but after a moment Harry decided it was an old fashioned
printing press, due to the fact that it was churning out Quibblers.
“Excuse me,” said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized a grubby tablecloth from beneath an immense number
of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and threw
it over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters.
He then faced Harry.
“Why have you come here?”
Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione lot out a small
cry of shock.
“Mr. Lovegood—what’s that?”
She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike
that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding
several feet into the room.
“It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophi400
Xenophilius Lovegood
lius.
“No it isn’t!” said Hermione.
“Hermione,” muttered Harry, embarrassed, “now’s not the
moment— ”
“But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable
Material and it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a
house!”
“How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, edging
away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter
of the room.
“There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find
Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t
you know it can explode at the slightest touch?”
“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius very clearly,
a mullish look upon his face, “is a shy and highly magical creature,
and its horn— ”
“Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the
base, that’s an Erumpent horn and it’s incredibly dangerous— I
don’t know where you got it— ”
“I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two weeks ago,
from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the
exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,”
he said, turning to Harry, “why exactly have you come here, Mr.
Potter?”
“We need some help,” said Harry, before Hermione could start
again.
“Ah,” said Xenophilius. “Help. Hmm.”
His good eye moved again to Harry’s scar. He seems simultaneously terrified and mesmerized.
“Yes. The thing is . . . helping Harry Potter . . . rather danger401
Chapter 20
ous . . . ”
“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first
duty to help Harry?” said Ron. “In that magazine of yours?”
Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press,
still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth.
“Er—yes, I have expressed that view. However— ”
“That’s for everyone else to do, not you personally?” said Ron.
Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he
was undergoing some painful internal struggle.
“Where’s Luna?” asked Hermione, “Let’s see what she thinks.”
Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally
he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the
printing press, “Luna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater
Plimpies. She . . . she will like to see you. I’ll go and call her and
then—very well. I shall try to help you.”
He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the
front door open and close. They looked at each other.
“Cowardly old wart,” said Ron. “Luna’s got ten times his guts.”
“He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the
Death Eaters find out I was here,” said Harry.
“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione. “Awful old hypocrite,
telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn.”
Harry crossed to the window of the far side of the room. He
could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at
the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past
the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere.
They were closer to each other than they had been since Bill and
402
Xenophilius Lovegood
Fleur’s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward
her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of it;
anyone he came into contact with was in danger. Xenophilius’s
attitude proved that.
He turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another
peculiar object standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a
stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most
bizarre-looking headdress. Two object that resembled golden ear
trumpets curved out form the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue
wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her
head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second
strap around her forehead.
“Look at this,” said Harry.
“Fetching,” said Ron. “Surprised he didn’t wear that to the
wedding.”
They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin
legs now encased in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted
teacups and a steaming teapot.
“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, shoving the
tray into Hermione’s arms and joining Harry at the statue’s side.
“Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowena
Ravenclaw. ’Wit beyond measure is a man’s greatest treasure!’”
He indicated the objects like ear trumpets.
“These are the Wrackspurt siphons— to remove all sources of
distraction from the thinker’s immediate area. Here,” he pointed
out the tiny wings, “a billywig propeller, to induce an elevated
frame of mind. Finally,” he pointed to the orange radish. “the
Dirgible Plum, so as th enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.”
403
Chapter 20
Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had
managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables.
“May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?” said Xenophilius. “We make it ourselves.” As he started to pour out the drink,
which was a deep purple as beetroot juice, he added, “Luna is down
beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She
ought not be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plumpies to
make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar.
“Now,” he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair
and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, “how may I help you,
Mr. Potter?”
“Well,” said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly. “it’s about that symbol you were wearing around your
neck at Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Mr. Lovegood. We wondered
what it meant.”
Xenophilius raised his eyebrows.
“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?”
404
Chapter 21
The Tale of the Three
Brothers
H
arry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither
of them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius
had said either.
“The Deathly Hallows?”
“That’s right,” said Xenophilius. “You haven’t heard of them?
I’m not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that
knuckle-headed young man at your brother’s wedding,” he nodded
at Ron, “who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known
Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the
Hallows— at least, not in that crude sense. One simply uses the
symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they
might help one with the Quest.”
He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion
and drank some.
“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I still don’t really understand.”
405
Chapter 21
“To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged:
The stuff was quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized
bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans.
“Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius, smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot
infusion.
“But what are the Deathly Hallows?” asked Hermione.
Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup.
“I assume that you are all familiar with the “Tale of the Three
Brothers’?”
Harry said, “No,” but Ron and Hermione said, “Yes.” Xenophilius nodded gravely.
“Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with ‘The Tale
of the Three Brothers’ . . . I have a copy somewhere. . . .”
He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment
and books, but Hermione said, “I’ve got a copy, Mr. Lovegood,
I’ve got it right here.”
And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small,
beaded bag.
“The original?” inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she
nodded, he said, “Well then, why don’t you read it out loud? Much
the best way to make sure we all understand.”
“Er . . . all right,” said Hermione nervously. She opened the
book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating
headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began
to read.
“‘There were once three brothers who were traveling along a
lonely, winding road at twilight— ’”
“Midnight, our mum always told us,” said Ron, who had
406
The Tale of the Three Brothers
stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot
him a look of annoyance.
“Sorry, I just think it’s a bit spookier if it’s midnight!” said
Ron.
“Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,” said
Harry before he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to
be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at
the sky. “Go on, Hermione.”
“‘In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through
and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were
learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands
and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were
halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded
figure.
“‘And Death spoke to them— ’”
“Sorry,” interjected Harry, “but Death spoke to them?”
“It’s a fairy tale, Harry!”
“Right, sorry. Go on.”
“‘And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been
cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in
the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned
a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.
“‘So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for
a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must
always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had
conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks
of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and
gave it to the older brother.
407
Chapter 21
“‘Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided
that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the
power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from
the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that
the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.
“‘And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he
would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the
wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for
something that would enable him to go forth from that place without
being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over
his own Cloak of Invisibility.’”
“Death’s got an Invisibility Cloak?” Harry interrupted again.
“So he can sneak up on people,” said Ron. “Sometimes he gets
bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry
Hermione.”
“‘Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the
adventure they had had, and admiring Death’s gifts.
“‘In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.
“‘The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching
a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a
quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could
not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon
the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted
loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself,
and of how it made him invincible.
“‘That very night, another wizard crept upon the older brother
as he lay wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and,
408
The Tale of the Three Brothers
for good measure, slit the oldest brother’s throat.
“‘And so Death took the first brother for his own.
“‘Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home,
where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power
to recall the dead, and he turned it thrice in his hand. To his
amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped
to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.
“‘Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil.
Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly
belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad
with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her.
“‘And so Death took the second brother for his own.
“‘But though Death searched for the third brother for many
years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he attained
a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of
Invisibility and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as
an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed
this life.’”
Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before
Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then
he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, “Well, there you
are.”
“Sorry?” said Hermione, sounding confused.
“Those are the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius.
He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled
a torn piece of parchment from between more books.
“The Elder Wand,” he said, and he drew a straight vertical line
upon the parchment. “The Resurrection Stone,” he said, and he
added a circle on top of the line. “The Cloak of Invisibility,” he
409
Chapter 21
finished, enclosing both the line and circle in a triangle, to make
the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. “Together,” he said, “the
Deathly Hallows.”
“But there’s no mention of the words ‘Deathly Hallows‘ in the
story,” said Hermione.
“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug.
“That is a children’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct.
Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize
that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if
united, will make the possessor master of Death.”
There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of
the window. Already the sun was low in the sky.
“Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,” he said quietly.
“When you say ‘master of Death’— ” said Ron.
“Master,” said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. “Conqueror.
Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.”
“But then . . . do you mean . . . ” said Hermione slowly, and
Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, “that you believe these objects— these
Hallows— actually exist?”
Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again.
“Well, of course.”
“But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, “Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe—?”
“Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius.
“You are, I gather, no unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow.
Close-minded.”
“Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,” said Ron,
nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shock with the
410
The Tale of the Three Brothers
strain of not laughing.
“Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again, “We all know that
there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but
they exist. But— ”
“Ah, but the Third Hallows is true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss
Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with
a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex or else
woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade
with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak
that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and
endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment,
no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you
ever seen like that, Miss Granger?”
Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again,
looking more confused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced at
one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same
thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very
moment.
“Exactly,” said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in
reasoned argument. “None of you have ever seen such a thing. The
possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?”
He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged
with the faintest trace of pink.
“All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted. “Say the cloak
existed . . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you
call the Resurrection Stone?”
“What of it?”
“Well, how can that be real?”
411
Chapter 21
“Prove that it is not,” said Xenophilius.
Hermione looked outraged.
“But that’s— I’m sorry, but that’s completely ridiculous! How
can I possibly prove it doesn’t exist? Do you expect me to get hold
of— of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you
could claim that anything’s real if the only basis for believing in it
is that nobody’s proved it doesn’t exist!”
“Yes, you could,” said Xenophilius. “I am glad to see that you
are opening your mind a little.”
“So the Elder Wand,” said Harry quickly, before Hermione
could retort, “you think that exists too?”
“Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophilius. “The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced,
because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.”
“Which is what?” asked Harry.
“Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from
its previous owner, if he is to be truly a master of it,” said Xenophilius. “Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert
the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how
Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the
wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from
Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the
Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.”
Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius,
but she did not contradict him.
“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” asked Ron.
“Alas, who knows?” said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the
window. “Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The
trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them
412
The Tale of the Three Brothers
really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can
say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.”
There was a pause. Finally, Hermione asked stiffly, “Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly
Hallows?”
Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry’s
memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell . . . he had heard that
name before. . . .
“But have you been misleading me, young woman!” said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling
at Hermione. “I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest!
Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything—
everything! — to do with the Hallows!”
“Who are the Peverells?” asked Ron.
“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Hollow,” said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. “Ignorus
Peverell.”
“Exactly!” said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically.
“The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus’s grave is conclusive
proof!”
“Of what?” asked Ron.
“Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the
three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they
were the original owners of the Hallows!”
With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked
up the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase.
“You will stay for dinner?” he called, as he vanished downstairs again. “Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater
Plimpy soup.”
413
Chapter 21
“Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s,”
said Ron under his breath.
Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about
in the kitchen downstairs before speaking.
“What do you think?” he asked Hermione.
“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This
can’t be the what the sign really means. This must be his weird
take on it. What a waste of time.”
“I s’pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned
Snorkacks,” said Ron.
“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him.
“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach
them lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick up
fights, don’t go messing around with stuff that’s best left alone!
Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you’ll be
okay.’ Come to think of it,” Ron added, “maybe that story’s why
elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.”
“What are you talking about?”
“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will
marry Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.’ ‘Wand of
elder, never prosper.’ You must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of
them.”
“Harry and I were raised by Muggles,” Hermione reminded him.
“We were taught different superstitions.” She sighed deeply as a
rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good
thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed
to make her forget that she was annoyed with Ron. “I think you’re
right,” she told him. “It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which
gift is best, which one you’d choose— ”
414
The Tale of the Three Brothers
The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, “the
Cloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry said, “the stone.”
They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.
“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told Hermione, “but
you wouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!”
“We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.
“And it’s helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn’t noticed!”
said Hermione. “Whereas the wand would be bound to attract
trouble— ”
“Only if you shouted about it,” argued Ron. “Only if you were
prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and
singing, ‘I’ve got an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you
think you’re good enough.’ As you as you kept your trap shut— ”
“Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?” said Hermione, looking skeptical. “You know, the only true thing he said to us was that
there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds
of years.”
“There have?” asked Harry.
Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other.
“The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the centuries, usually in the possession of
some Dark wizard who’s boasting about them. Professor Binns
mentioned some of them, but— oh, it’s all nonsense. Wands are
only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just
like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people’s.”
“But how do you know,” said Harry, “that those wands— the
Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny— aren’t the same wand, sur415
Chapter 21
facing over the centuries under different names?”
“What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?”
said Ron.
Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was,
after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded himself, had been of
holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it
had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies.
And if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken?
“So why would you take the stone?” Ron asked him.
“Well, if you could bring people back, we could have
Sirius . . . Mad-Eye . . . Dumbledore . . . my parents. . . .”
“But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn’t want to come
back, would they?” said Harry, thinking about the tale they had
just heard. “I don’t suppose there have been loads of other stories
about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?” he asked Hermione.
“No,” she replied sadly. “I don’t think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that’s possible. Beedle probably took
the idea from the Sorcerer’s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to
make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.”
The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It was something like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would
be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to
spare his feelings.
“What about the Cloak, though?” said Ron slowly. “Don’t you
realize he’s right? I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good
it is, I never stopped to think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s.
It’s infallible. We’ve never been spotted under it— ”
“Of course not—we’re invisible when we’re under it, Ron!”
416
The Tale of the Three Brothers
“But all the stuff he said about the other cloaks, and they’re not
exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It’s never occurred to me
before, but I’ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when
they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they’ve got
holes in them. Harry’s was owned by his dad, so it’s not exactly
new, is it, but it’s just . . . perfect!”
“Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone . . . ”
As they argued in whispered, Harry moved around the room,
only half listening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes
absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face
was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above.
After a moment’s bewilderment, he realized that it was not a
mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs.
“Harry, what are you doing? I don’t think you should look
around when he’s not here!”
But Harry had already reached the next level.
Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully
painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They
were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there
was a certain magic about them all the same: Harry thought
they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove
around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains
were actually one word, repeated a thousand times in golden ink:
friends . . . friends . . . friends . . .
Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around
the room. There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young
Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging.
Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had
417
Chapter 21
ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as
slightly odd. He stared around.
Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with
dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood
ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not
been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest
window, across a bloodred sky.
“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of
the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls.
“Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry. “Where’s Luna?”
“Excuse me?”
“Where’s Luna?”
Xenophilius halted on the top step.
“I— I’ve already told you. She is down at Bortons Bridge, fishing for Plimpies.”
“So why have you only laid that tray for four?”
Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only
noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight
rattle from the tray as Xenophilius’s hands shook.
“I don’t think Luna’s been here for weeks,” said Harry. “Her
clothes are gone, her bed hasn’t been slept in. Where is she? And
why do you keep looking out of the window?”
Xenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and
smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their wands. Xenophilius frowned, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers
came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth,
the press fell silent at last.
418
The Tale of the Three Brothers
Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines,
her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood.
“Harry, look at this.”
He strode to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter.
The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned
with the words Undesirable Number One and captioned with
the reward money.
“The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” Harry asked
coldly, his mind working very fast. “Is that what you were doing
when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to
the Ministry?”
Xenophilius licked his lips.
“They took my Luna,” he whispered. “Because of what I’ve
been writing. They took my Luna and I don’t know where she is,
what they’ve done to her. But they might give her back to me if
I—if I— ”
“Hand over Harry?” Hermione finished for him.
“No deal,” said Ron flatly. “Get out of the way, we’re leaving.”
Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his laps drawn back
into a dreadful leer.
“They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot
lose Luna. You must not leave.”
He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a
sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his
crib.
“Don’t make us hurt you,” Harry said. “Get out of the way,
Mr. Lovegood.”
“HARRY!” Hermione screamed.
Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the
419
Chapter 21
three of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand.
Harry realized their mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm’s way as Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent
horn.
There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow
the room apart: Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew to
all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust.
Harry flew through the door, then crashed to the floor, unable to
see as debris rained upon him, his arms above his head. He heard
Hermione’s scream, Ron’s yell, and a series of sickening metallic
thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his
feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs.
Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could
barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fallen in, and
the end of Luna’s bed was hanging through the hole. The bust
of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing,
fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and
most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the
staircase to the kitchen. Then another whit shape moved close
by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her
finger to her lips.
The door downstairs crashed open.
“Didn’t I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?” said
a rough voice. “Didn’t I tell you this nutter was just raving as
usual?”
There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius.
“No . . . no . . . upstairs . . . Potter!”
“I told you last week, Lovegood, we weren’t coming back
420
The Tale of the Three Brothers
for anything less than some solid information! Remember last
week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid
bleeding headdress? And the week before”— another bang, another squeal— “when you thought we’d give her back if you offered us proof there are Crumple”—bang — “Headed”—bang —
“Snorkacks?”
“No—no— I beg you!” sobbed Xenophilius. “It really is Potter!
Really!”
“And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow
us up!” roared the Death Eater, and there are a volley of bangs
interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius.
“This place looks like it’s about to fall in, Selwyn,” said a cool
second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase. “The stairs are
completely blocked. Could trying clearing it? Might bring the
place down.”
“You lying piece of filth,” shouted the wizard named Selwyn.
“you’ve never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you’d
lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you’ll get your girl
back like this?”
“I swear . . . I swear . . . Potter’s upstairs!”
“Homenum revelio,” said the voice at the foot of the stairs.
Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation that
something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its
shadow.
“It’s Potter, I tell you, it’s Potter!” sobbed Xenophilius.
“Please . . . please . . . give me Luna, just let me have Luna. . . .”
“You can have your little girl, Lovegood,” said Selwyn, “if you
get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is
a plot, if it’s a trick, if you’ve got an accomplice waiting up there
421
Chapter 21
to ambush us, we’ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for
you to bury.”
Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get though the
debris on the stairs.
“Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.”
He stated to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry
and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his
legs. While Xenophilius’s banging and scraping drew nearer and
nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover
Charm.
“All right,” breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press
blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was
feet away from them. She was still white with dust. “Do you trust
me, Harry?”
Harry nodded.
“Okay then,” Hermione whispered, “give me the Invisibility
Cloak. Ron, you’re going to put it on.”
“Me? But Harry— ”
“Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my
shoulder.”
Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak.
The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius
was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know
what Hermione was waiting for.
“Hold tight,” she whispered. “Hold tight . . . any second . . . ”
Xenophilius’s paper-white face appeared over the top of the
422
The Tale of the Three Brothers
sideboard.
“Obliviate!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand first into his
face, and then at the floor beneath them. “Deprimo!”
She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like
boulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was
a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out
of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained
all around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in
midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry’s
ears as she dragged him once more into darkness.
423
Chapter 22
The Deathly Hallows
H
arry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once.
They seemed to have landed in the corner of a field at
dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around
them, waving her wand.
“Protego Totalum . . . Salvio Hexia . . . ”
“That treacherous old bleeder.” Ron panted, emerging from
beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. “Hermione you’re a genius, a total genius. I can’t believe we got out of
that.”
“Cave Inimicum . . . Didn’t I say it was an Erumpent horn,
didn’t I tell him? And now his house has been blown apart!”
“Serves him right,” said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the
cuts to his legs, “What’d you reckon they’ll do to him?”
“Oh I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione, “That’s
why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before
we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!”
“Why hide me though?” asked Ron.
“You’re supposed to be in bed with spattergroit, Ron! They’ve
424
The Deathly Hallows
kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry! What would
happen to your family if they knew you’re with him?”
“But what about your mum and dad?”
“They’re in Australia,” said Hermione, “They should be all
right. They don’t know anything.”
“You’re a genius,” Ron repeated, looking awed.
Yeah, you are, Hermione,” agreed Harry fervently. “I don’t
know what we’d do without you.”
She beamed, but became solemn at once.
“What about Luna?”
“Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still Alive— ” began
Ron.
“Don’t say that, don’t say it!” squealed Hermione. “She must
be alive, she must!”
“Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said Ron. “Whether she
survives the place, though . . . Loads don’t . . . ”
“She will,” said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the
alternative. “She’s tough, Luna, much tougher than you’d think.
She’s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and
Nargles.”
“I hope you’re right,” said Hermione. She passed a hand over
her eyes. “I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if— “
“—if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,”
said Ron.
They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made
them tea. After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place
felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly.
“Oh, why did we go there?” groaned Hermione after a few minutes’ silence. “Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over
425
Chapter 22
again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows . . . such
rubbish . . . although actually,” a sudden thought seemed to have
struck her, “he might have made it all up, mightn’t he? He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted
to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!”
“I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn sight harder making
stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that
out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending
to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole
new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to
make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what
he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.”
“Well, I don’t suppose it matters,” sighed Hermione. “Even if
he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my
life.”
“Hang on, though,” said Ron. “The Chamber of Secrets was
supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?”
“But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!”
“You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said Ron.
“Harry’s Invisibility Cloak— “
“The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said Hermione
firmly. “A story about how humans are frightened of death. If
surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d
have everything we need already!”
“I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,” said
Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers.
“There’s no such thing, Harry!”
“You said there have been loads of wands— the Deathstick and
426
The Deathly Hallows
whatever they were called— “
“All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s
real, what about the Resurrection Stone?” Her fingers sketched
quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm.
“No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!”
“When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my
mum and dad appear . . . and Cedric . . . ”
“But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?” said
Hermione. “Those kind of— of pale imitations aren’t the same as
truly bringing someone back to life.”
“But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she?
The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the
dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her,
didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while . . . ”
He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione’s expression. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized
that it was fear: He had scared her with his talk of living with
dead people.
“So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,” he
said hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, “you don’t know anything about him, then?”
“No,” she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. “I
looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of
our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’
is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from
Kreacher,” she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. “It lists the
pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.”
427
Chapter 22
“Extinct in the male line?” repeated Ron.
“It means the name died out,” said Hermione, “centuries ago,
in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants,
though, they’d just be called something different.”
And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory
that had stirred at the sound of the name “Peverell”: a filthy old
man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and
he cried aloud, “Marvolo Gaunt!”
“Sorry,” said Ron and Hermione together.
“Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who’s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended
from the Peverells!”
Ron and Hermione looked bewildered.
“The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt
said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it
in the bloke from the Ministry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his
nose!”
“The Peverell coat of arms?” said Hermione sharply. “Could
you see what it looked like?”
“Not really,” said Harry, trying to remember. “There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I
only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.”
Harry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening
of her eyes. Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished.
“Blimey . . . You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the
Hallows?
“Why not said Harry excitedly, “Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry.
If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might
428
The Deathly Hallows
not have known what it really was. There were no books in that
house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his
kids. He’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were
a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure
blood made you practically royal.”
“Yes . . . and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione cautiously, “but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think— “
“Well, why not? Why not? said Harry, abandoning caution.
“It was a stone, wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron for support. “What
if it was the Resurrection Stone?”
Ron’s mouth fell open.
“Blimey—but would it still work if Dumbledore broke—?”
“Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as
a Resurrection Stone!”
Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry.
Harry you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story— “
“Fit everything in?” he repeated. “Hermione, it fits of its own
accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone!
Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!”
“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone
properly!”
“Where’d you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry.
“What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?”
“But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron
and Hermione’s . . .
Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death . . . Master . . . Conqueror . . . Vanquisher . . .
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. . . .
And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort,
429
Chapter 22
whose Horcruxes were no match . . . Neither can live while the other
survives . . . Was this the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was
there a way after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed?
If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe?
“Harry?”
But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple
as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in his
nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly
what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving
constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are
cast at it . . .
And then, with a gasp, he remembered—
“Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!”
His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he
did not care.
“My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak!
This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was
the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow . . . ”
Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great
new vistas of truth were opening all around him. “He’s my ancestor. I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!”
“He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if
the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and
he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two.
“Harry,” said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the
pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard.
“Read it,” he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into her hand.
430
The Deathly Hallows
“Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would
he want it? He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible
without one!”
Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair:
He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He
stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous
discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted
inside him so that he shouted out.
“IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring—it’s in the Snitch!”
“You—you reckon?”
He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was
so obvious, so clear to Harry. Everything fit, everything . . . His
Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open
the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do
was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then—
But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and
he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken.
“That’s what he’s after.”
The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more
scared.
“You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand.”
He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew
it was the truth. It all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a
new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed.
Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and
Hermione as he looked out into the night, thinking . . .
Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody
431
Chapter 22
could have told him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a
child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards
believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort
knew about them?
Harry gazed into the darkness. . . . If Voldemort had known
about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them,
done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows,
he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn’t the
simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding
secret?
Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without
realizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of
three. . . . for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden,
whose existence was best known. . . . The bloody trail of the Elder
Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history . . .
Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver
sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with
amazement at his discoveries.
He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily’s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn’t
they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes?
“This is it?” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow
of his own astonished certainty, “This explains everything. The
Deathly Hallows are real and I’ve got one—maybe two— “
He held up the Snitch.
“— and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t
432
The Deathly Hallows
realize . . . he just thinks it’s a powerful wand— “
“Harry,” said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him
back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all
wrong.”
“But don’t you see? It all fits— “
“Not, it doesn’t,” she said. “It doesn’t. Harry, you’re just
getting carried away. Please,” she said as she started to speak,
“please just answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed,
and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of Death—Harry, why wouldn’t
he have told you? Why?”
He had his answer ready.
“But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out about them
for yourself! It’s a Quest!”
“But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the
Lovegoods’!” cried Hermione in exasperation. “I didn’t really
believe it!”
Harry took no notice.
“Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me
try my strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d
do.”
“Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is the real
thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and
destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget
the Deathly Hallows, we can’t afford to get sidetracked— “
Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch
over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to
reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was
right, that the Deathly Hallows were real.
433
Chapter 22
She appealed to Ron.
“You don’t believe in this, do you?”
Harry looked up, Ron hesitated.
“I dunno . . . I mean . . . bits of it sort of fit together,” said Ron
awkwardly, “But when you look at the whole thing . . . ” He took
a deep breath. “I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes,
Harry. That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe . . . maybe
we should forget about this Hallows business.”
“Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione. “I’ll take first watch.”
And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance
bringing the action to a fierce full stop.
But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly
Hallows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while
agitating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone,
and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all. . . .
I open at the close. . . . But what was the close? Why couldn’t
he have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person . . . and Harry murmured words
to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue,
but the golden ball would not open. . . .
And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where
was Voldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn
and show him Voldemort’s thoughts, because for the first time
ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same
thing . . . Hermione would not like that idea, of course. . . . But
then, she did not believe. . . . Xenophilius had been right, in a
way . . . Limited, Narrow, Close-minded. The truth was that she
was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the
Resurrection Stone . . . and Harry pressed his mouth again to the
434
The Deathly Hallows
Snitch, kissing it, nearly swallowing it, but the cold medal did not
yield. . . .
It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in
Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed
of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but dementors
in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came
to think about it, he had not tried casting a Patronus with the
blackthorn wand. . . . He must try that in the morning . . .
If only there was a way of getting a better wand . . .
And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable,
invincible, swallowed him once more. . . .
They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through
a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast,
where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the
whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak
and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It
was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not
Hermione’s flat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside
him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione:
Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for
dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which
remained absolute. Harry’s belief in and longing for the Hallows
consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and
their obsession with the Horcruxes.
“Obsession?” said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry
was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione
had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes.
435
Chapter 22
“We’re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We’re the ones trying
to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!”
But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore
had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and
he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection
Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other
survives . . . master of Death . . . Why didn’t Ron and Hermione
understand?
“‘The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,’” Harry quoted
calmly.
“I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?” Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her.
Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted
on discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him
was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all
he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude
whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The
visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality;
they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in
and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct
features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a
mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images
sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was
worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had
been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he
had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it
was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into
436
The Deathly Hallows
Voldemort’s mind as well as before.
As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even
through his new self-absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking
charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having
walked out on them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one
now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action.
“Three Horcruxes left,” he kept saying. “We need a plan of
action, come on! Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it
again. The orphanage . . . ”
Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes,
Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or
worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them
again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He
would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron
insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry
was aware, to keep them moving.
“You never know,” was Ron’s constant refrain. “Upper Flagley
is a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go
and have a poke around.”
These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them
within occasional sight of Snatchers.
“Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,”
said Ron. “The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill recons
some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch — “
“On what?” said Harry.
“Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The
program I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells
437
Chapter 22
the truth about what’s going on! Nearly all of the programs are
following You-Know-Who’s line, all except Potterwatch, I really
want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in . . . ”
Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out
various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled.
Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat
dragonpox, and once a few bars of “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong
Love.” While he taped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct
password, muttering strings of random words under his breath.
“They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he told
them. “Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get
one in the end . . . ”
“But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was
sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump
of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly
ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent.
“I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ‘Albus’! Get in here,
Harry.”
Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the
Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron
and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for
something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny
speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing.
“ . . . apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves,
which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those
charming Death Eaters.”
“But that’s Lee Jordan!” said Hermione.
“I know!” beamed Ron. “Cool, eh?”
438
The Deathly Hallows
“ . . . now found ourselves another secure location,” Lee was saying, and I’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors
have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!”
“Hi.”
“Evening, River.”
“‘River’” that’s Lee,” Ron explained. “They’ve all got code
names, but you can usually tell— “
“Shh!” said Hermione.
“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,” Lee went on,
“let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding
Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don’t think important
enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our
listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.”
Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione
gazed at one another in horror.
“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed
that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed
to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may
have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge
of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news.
“Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found
dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths
to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me
that it was the Killing Curse—more evidence, as if it were needed,
of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a
recreational sport under the new regime.
“Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of
Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow. The
evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the
439
Chapter 22
Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of
injuries inflicted by Dark Magic.
“Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot,
Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.”
Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half
of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what
might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected
to the outside world for a long time.
“Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we can return to
regular contributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding
order is affecting the Muggle world.”
“Thanks, River,” said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured,
reassuring.
“Kingsley!” burst out Ron.
“We know!” said Hermione, hushing him.
“Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they
continue to sustain heavy casualties,” said Kingsley. “However, we
continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches
risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors,
often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our
listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective
charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could
be saved if such simple measures are taken.”
“And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply
that in these dangerous times, it should be ‘Wizards first’?” asked
Lee.
“I’d say that it’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Pure440
The Deathly Hallows
bloods first,’ and then to ‘Death Eaters,’” replied Kingsley. “We’re
all human, aren’t we? Every human life is worth the same, and
worth saving.”
“Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of
Magic if we ever get out of this mess,” said Lee. “And now, over
to Romulus for our popular feature ‘Pals of Potter.’”
“Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice. Ron started
to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper.
“We know it’s Lupin!”
“Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?”
“I do,” said Lupin firmly. “There is no doubt at all in my
mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by
the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a
deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. ‘The
Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are
fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to
keep resisting.”
A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had
Lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when
they had last met?
“And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening,
Romulus?”
“I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, then
hesitated slightly, “And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which
are good and nearly always right.”
Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears.
“Nearly always right,” she repeated.
“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise. “Bill told me
441
Chapter 22
Lupin’s living with Tonks again! And apparently she’s getting
pretty big too . . . ”
“ . . . and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s
who are suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,”
said Lupin.
“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus
Hagrid”— all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest
of the sentence— “well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has
narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he
is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter’ party in his
house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we
believe, on the run.”
“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve
got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.
“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely.
“May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’
parties are unwise in the present climate.”
“Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest that you
continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar
by listening to Potterwatch! And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We
like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his
views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him,
442
The Deathly Hallows
I’d like to introduce a new correspondent. Rodent?”
“‘Rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron,
and Hermione cried out together:
“Fred!”
“No—is it George?”
“It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever
twin it was said,
“I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be
‘Rapier’!”
“Oh, all right then, ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us your take
on the various stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death
Eater?”
“Yes, River, I can,” said Fred. “As our listeners will know,
unless they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or
somewhere similar, You-Know-Who’s strategy of remaining in the
shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if
all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good
nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.”
“Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air of mystery
is creating more terror than actually showing himself.”
“Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm down a
bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For
instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill people with
a single glance from his eyes. That’s a basilisk, listeners. One
simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got
legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really
is You-Know-Who, that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever
do.”
For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He
443
Chapter 22
could feel the weight of tension leaving him.
“And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?” asked
Lee.
“Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard
work he’s been putting in?” asked Fred. “Point is, people, don’t
get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he’s out of the
country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can
move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he
wants to, so don’t count on him being a long way away if you’re
planning to take any risks. I never thought I’d hear myself say it,
but safety first!”
“Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” said Lee.
“Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We
don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you
can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The
next password will be ‘Mad-Eye.’ Keep each other safe: Keep
faith. Good night.”
The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel
went out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing
familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had
become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other
people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long
sleep.
“Good, eh?” said Ron happily.
“Brilliant,” said Harry.
“It’s so brave of them,” sighed Hermione admiringly. “If they
were found . . . ”
“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. “Like
us.”
444
The Deathly Hallows
“But did you hear what Fred said?” asked Harry excitedly;
now the broadcast was over, his thoughts turned around toward
his all consuming obsession. “He’s abroad! He’s still looking for
the Wand, I knew it!”
“Harry— “
“Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit
it? Vol— “
“HARRY, NO!”
“—demort’s after the Elder Wand!”
“The name’s Taboo!” Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a
loud crack sounded outside the tent. “I told you, Harry, I told
you, we can’t say it anymore—we’ve got to put the protection
back around us—quickly—it’s how they find— “
But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear
voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled
the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went
out.
“Come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice
through the darkness. “We know you’re in there! You’ve got half
a dozen wands pointing at you and we don’t care who we curse!”
445
Chapter 23
Malfoy Manor
H
arry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines
in the darkness. He saw Hermione point her wand, set
toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang,
a burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable
to see. He could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as
heavy footfalls surrounded him.
“Get up, vermin.”
Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground, before
he could stop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets
and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers,
tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent
allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits through which
he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the
tent: all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five
people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too.
“Get— off—her!” Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable
446
Malfoy Manor
sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione
screamed, “No! Leave him alone, leave him alone!”
“Your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done to him if
he’s on my list,” said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. “Delicious girl . . . what a treat . . . I do enjoy the softness of the skin. . . .”
Harry’s stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrir
Greyback, the werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater
robes in return for his hired savagery.
“Search the tent!” said another voice.
Harry was thrown face down onto the ground. A thud told
him that Ron had been cast down beside him. They could hear
footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the
tent as they searched.
“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s gloating voice
from overhead, and Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam
of wand light fell onto his face and Greyback laughed.
“I’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?”
Harry did not answer immediately.
“I said,” repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the
diaphragm that made him double over in pain. “what happened
to you?”
“Stung.” Harry muttered. “Been Stung.”
“Yeah, looks like it.” said a second voice.
“What’s your name?” snarled Greyback.
“Dudley.” said Harry.
“And your first name?”
“I—Vernon. Vernon Dudley.”
“Check the list, Scabior.” said Greyback, and Harry head him
447
Chapter 23
move sideways to look down at Ron, instead. “And what about
you, ginger?”
“Stan Shunpike.” said Ron.
“Like ’ell you are.” said the man called Scabior. “We know
Stan Shunpike, ’e’s put a bit of work our way.”
There was another thud.
“I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was
full of blood. “Bardy Weasley.”
“A Weasley?” rasped Greyback. “So you’re related to blood
traitors even if you’re not a Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty
little friend . . . ” The relish in his voice made Harry’s flesh crawl.
“Easy, Greyback.” said Scabior over the jeering of the others.
“Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a bit
quicker at remembering her name than Barny. Who are you,
girly?”
“Penelope Clearwater.” said Hermione. She sounded terrified,
but convincing.
“What’s your blood status?”
“Half-Blood.” said Hermione.
“Easy enough to check,” said Scabior. “But the ’ole lot of ’em
look like they could still be ’ogwarts age— ”
“We’b lebt,” said Ron.
“Left, ’ave you, ginger?” said Scabior. “And you decided to go
camping? And you thought, just for a laugh, you’d use the Dark
Lords name?”
“Nod a laugh,” said Ron. “Aggiden.”
“Accident?” There was more jeering laughter.
“You know who used to like using the Dark Lord’s name,
Weasley?” growled Greyback, “The Order of the Phoenix. Mean
448
Malfoy Manor
anything to you?”
“Doh.”
“Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the
name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked
that way. We’ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!”
Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short
way, pushed him down into a sitting position, then started binding
him back-to-back with other people. Harry was still half blind,
barely able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at
last the man tying then had walked away, Harry whispered to the
other prisoners.
“Anyone still got a wand?”
“No.” Said Ron and Hermione from either side of him.
“This is all my fault. I said the name. I’m sorry— ”
“Harry?”
It was a new, but familiar voice. And it came from directly
behind Harry, from the person tied to Hermione’s left.
“Dean?”
“It is you! If they find out who they’ve got—! They’re Snatchers, they’re only looking for truants to sell for gold— ”
“Not a bad little haul for one night.” Greyback was saying, as
a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by Harry and they heard
more crashes from inside the tent. “A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and these truants. You checked their names on the list yet,
Scabior?” he roared.
“Yeah. There’s no Vernon Dudley un ’ere, Greyback.”
“Interesting,” said Greyback. “That’s interesting.”
He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted
449
Chapter 23
gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and sores in the
corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the
top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and
blood.
“So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list
under a different name? What house were you in at Hogwarts?”
“Slytherin,” said Harry automatically.
“Funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that.” leered
Scabior out of the shadows. “But none of ’em can tell us where
the common room is.”
“It’s in the dungeons.” said Harry clearly. “You enter through
the wall. It’s full of skulls and stuff and its under the lake, so the
light’s all green,”
There was a short pause.
“Well, well, looks like we really ’ave caught a little Slytherin.”
said Scabior. “Good for you, Vernon, ’cause there ain’t a lot of
Mudblood Slytherins. Who’s your father?”
“He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied. He knew that his whole
story would collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the
other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual appearance
before the game was up in any case. “Department of Magical
Accidents and Catastrophes.”
“You know what, Greyback,” said Scabior. “I think there is a
Dudley in there.”
Harry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them
safely out of this?
“Well, well.” said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest
note of trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback
was wondering whether he had just indeed just attacked and bound
450
Malfoy Manor
the son of a Ministry Official. Harry’s heart was pounding against
the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to
know that Greyback could see it. “If you’re telling the truth, ugly,
you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect
your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.”
“But,” said Harry, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let us— ”
“Hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “Look at this. Greyback!”
A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint
of silver to the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor’s
sword.
“Ve–e–ery nice,” said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from
his companion. “Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that.
Where did you get something like this?”
“It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was
too dark for Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt.
“We borrowed it to cut firewood— ”
“’Ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!”
As Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across
his distended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he
could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a
grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding: Voldemort’s thoughts had
suddenly become Razor-Sharp again; he was gliding toward the
gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose. . . .
So close . . . So close . . .
With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort’s
thoughts, pulling himself back to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, listening to Greyback
and Scabior. “‘’ermione Granger,’” Scabior was saying, “‘the Mud451
Chapter 23
blood who is known to be traveling with ’arry Potter.’”
Harry’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort
to keep himself present, not to slip into Voldemort’s mind. He
heard the creak of Greyback’s boots as he crouched down, in front
of Hermione.
“You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot
like you.”
“It isn’t! It isn’t me!”
Hermione’s terrified squeak was as good as a confession.
“ . . . known to be traveling with Harry Potter,” repeated Greyback quietly.
A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry’s scar was
Exquisitely painful, but he struggled with all his strength against
the pull of Voldemort’s thoughts. It had never been so important
to remain in his own right mind.
“Well, this changed things, doesn’t it?” whispered Greyback.
Nobody spoke: Harry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching,
frozen, and felt Hermione’s arm trembling against his. Greyback
got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching
down again to stare closely at his misshapen features.
“What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked softly, his
breath foul in Harry’s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the
taught scar.
“Don’t touch it!” Harry yelled; he could not stop himself, he
thought he might be sick from the pain of it.
“I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” breathed Greyback.
“I found glasses!” yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the
background. “There was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait— ”
And seconds later Harry’s glasses had been rammed back onto
452
Malfoy Manor
his face. The Snatchers were closing in now, peering at him.
“It is!” rasped Greyback. “We’ve caught Potter!”
They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they
had done. Harry, still fighting to remain present in his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say. Fragmented visions were
breaking across the surface of his mind—
—He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress —
No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger—
—looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower —
He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices—
—Time to fly . . .
“ . . . To the Ministry?”
“To hell with the Ministry.” growled Greyback. “They’ll take
the credit, and we won’t get a look in. I say we take him straight
to You-Know-Who.”
“Will you summon ’im? ’ere?” said Scabior, sounding awed,
terrified.
“No,” snarled Greyback, “I haven’t got— they say he’s using
the Malfoy’s place as a base. We’ll take the boy there.”
Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The werewolf might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes
when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort’s inner circle
were branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been granted
this highest honor.
Harry’s scar seared again—
—and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the windows
at the very top of the tower—
“ . . . completely sure it’s him? ’Cause if it ain’t, Greyback,
we’re dead.”
453
Chapter 23
“Who’s in charge here?” roared Greyback, covering his moment
of inadequacy. “I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s
two hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you’re too gutless to come along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck,
I’ll get the girl thrown in!”
—The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big
enough for a man to enter. . . . A skeletal figure was just visible
through it, curled beneath a blanket. . . . Dead, or sleeping . . . ?
“All right!” said Scabior. “All right, we’re in! And what about
the rest of ’em, Greyback, what’ll we do with ’em?”
“Might as well take the lot. We’ve got two Mudbloods, that’s
another ten Galleons. Give me the sword as well. If they’re rubies,
that’s another small fortune right there.”
The prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear
Hermione’s breathing, fast and terrified.
“Grab hold and make it tight. I’ll do Potter!” said Greyback,
seizing a fistful of Harry’s hair; Harry could feel his long yellow
nails scratching his scalp. “On three! One— two— three— “
They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry
struggled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless:
Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either
side; he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was
squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still—
—as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake
and landed, lightly as vapor inside the cell-like room —
The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. Harry’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize,
then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked
like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The
454
Malfoy Manor
worst had not happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He was,
Harry knew, for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange,
fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take
Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry was here,
was another matter. . . .
One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them.
“How do we get in? They’re locked, Greyback, I can’t—
blimey!”
He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting,
twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice. “State your
purpose!”
“We’ve got Potter!” Greyback roared triumphantly. “We’ve
captured Harry Potter!”
The gates swung open.
“Come on!” said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were
shunted through the gates and up the drive, between high hedges
that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above
him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was
dragged onto his feet by Greyback; now he was staggering along
sideways, tied back-to-back to the four other prisoner. Closing his
puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a
moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he
knew yet that Harry was caught. . . .
The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled
over toward him, eyes opening in a skull of a face. . . . The frail
man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort,
and then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. . . .
“So, you have come. I thought you would . . . one day. But your
455
Chapter 23
journey was pointless. I never had it.”
“You lie!”
As Voldemort’s anger throbbed inside him, Harry’s scar threatened to burst with pain, and he wrenched his mind back to his own
body, fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over
gravel.
Light spilled out over all of them.
“What is this?” said a woman’s cold voice.
“We’re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” rasped
Greyback.
“Who are you?”
“You know me!” There was resentment in the werewolf’s voice.
“Fenrir Greyback! We’ve caught Harry Potter!”
Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the
light, forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too.
“I know ’es swollen, ma’am, but it’s ’im!” piped up Scabior.
“If you look a bit closer, you’ll see ’is scar. And this ’ere, see
the girl? The Mudblood who’s been traveling around with ’im,
ma’am. There’s no doubt it’s ’im, and we’ve got ’is wand as well!
’Ere, ma’am— “
Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her.
She raised her eyebrows.
“Bring them in,” she said.
Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone
steps into a hallway lined with portraits.
“Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall.
“My son, Draco, is home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry
Potter, he will know.”
456
Malfoy Manor
The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with
his eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions
of the room. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more
portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from
chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were
forced into the room by the Snatchers.
“What is this?”
The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on
Harry’s ears. He was panicking now. He could see no way out,
and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out Voldemort’s
thoughts, though his scar was still burning.
“They say they’ve got Potter,” said Narcissa’s cold voice.
“Draco, come here.”
Harry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him
obliquely; a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.
Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry
directly beneath the chandelier.
“Well, boy?” rasped the werewolf.
Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing
in an intricately scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he
saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld
Place.
His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by
Hermione’s jinx. His black hair reached his shoulders and there
was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was
he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his
glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give
him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter
457
Chapter 23
approached.
“Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. “Is it?
Is it Harry Potter?”
“I can’t— I can’t be sure,” said Draco. He was keeping his
distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry
as Harry was of looking at him.
“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!”
Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.
“Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark
Lord, everything will be forgiv— “
“Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope
Mr. Malfoy?” said Greyback menacingly.
“Of course not, of course not!” said Lucius impatiently. He
approached Harry himself, came so close that Harry could see the
usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen
eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was
peering out from between the bars of a cage.
“What did you do to him?” Lucius asked Greyback. “How did
he get into this state?”
“That wasn’t us.”
“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” said Lucius.
His gray eyes raked Harry’s forehead.
“There’s something there,” he whispered. “it could be the scar,
stretched tight. . . .” Draco, come here, look properly! What do
you think?”
Harry saw Draco’s face up close now, right beside his father’s.
They were extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked
beside himself with excitement, Draco’s expression was full of reluctance, even fear.

“I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching.
“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that it is Potter,
before we summon the Dark Lord . . . They say this is his”— she
was looking closely at the blackthorn wand— “but it does not resemble Ollivander’s description. . . . If we are mistaken, if we call the
Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle
and Dolohov?”
“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. Harry
was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners
to swivel around again, so that the light fell on Hermione instead.
“Wait,” said Narcissa sharply. “Yes—yes, she was in Madam
Malkin’s with Potter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look,
Draco, isn’t it the Granger girl?”
“I . . . maybe . . . yeah.”
“But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius, striding around the bound prisoners to face Ron. “It’s them, Potter’s
friends—Draco, look at him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s
his name—?”
“Yeah,” said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. “It could
be.”
The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke,
and the sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher
pitch.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”
Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and
stopped on Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily
lidded eyes,
459
Chapter 23
“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This
is Granger?”
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius, “And beside her, we
think, Potter! Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better
to take in Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must
be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark
burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to
touch it, to summon her beloved master—
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually
closed upon Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the
Mark. “I shall summon him, Bella. Potter has been brought to
my house, and it is therefore upon my authority— “
“Your authority!” she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand
from his grasp. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand,
Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!”
“This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy— “
“Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,” interjected Greyback, “but
it’s us that caught Potter, and it’s us that’ll be claiming the gold—
“
“Gold!” laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her
brother-in-law, her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand.
“Take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I seek
only the honor of his— of— “
She stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something
Harry could not see. Jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw
her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve—
“STOP!” shrieked Bellatrix, “Do not touch it, we shall all perish
460
Malfoy Manor
if the Dark Lord comes now!”
Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode out of Harry’s limited line of vision.
“What is that?” he heard her say.
“Sword,” grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher.
“Give it to me.”
“It’s not yours, missus, it’s mine, I reckon I found it.”
There was a bang and a flash of red light; Harry knew that the
Snatcher had been Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his
fellows: Scabior drew his wand.
“What d’you think you’re playing at, woman?”
“Stupefy!” she screamed, “Stupefy!”
They were no match for her, even thought there were four of
them against one of her: She was a witch, as Harry knew, with
prodigious skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all
except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position,
his arms outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw
Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor
gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen.
“Where did you get this sword?” she whispered to Greyback
as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip.
“How dare you?” he snarled, his mouth the only thing that
could move as he was forced to gaze up at her. He bared his
pointed teeth. “Release me, woman!”
“Where did you find this sword?” she repeated, brandishing it
in his face, “Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!”
“It was in their tent,” rasped Greyback. “Release me, I say!”
She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but
appeared too wary to approach her. He prowled behind an arm461
Chapter 23
chair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back.
“Draco, move this scum outside,” said Bellatrix, indicating the
unconscious men. “If you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then
leave them in the courtyard for me.”
“Don’t you dare speak to Draco like— ” said Narcissa furiously,
but Bellatrix screamed.
“Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious problem!”
She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. Then she turned to look at the silent prisoners.
“If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,” she muttered,
more to herself than to the others. “The Dark Lord wishes to
dispose of Potter himself. . . . But if he finds out . . . I must . . . I
must know. . . .”
She turned back to her sister again.
“The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what
to do!”
“This is my house, Bella, you don’t give orders in my— “
“Do it! You have no idea of the danger we’re in!” shrieked
Bellatrix. She looked frightening, mad; a thin stream of fire issued
from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet.
Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf.
“Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.”
“Wait,” said Bellatrix sharply. “All except. . . . except for the
Mudblood.”
Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure.
“No!” shouted Ron. “You can have me, keep me!”
Bellatrix hit him across the face: the blow echoed around the
room.
462
Malfoy Manor
“If she dies under questioning, I’ll take you next,” she said.
“Blood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing
more to them—yet.”
She threw Greyback’s wand back to him, then took a short
silver knife from under her robes. She cut Hermione free from the
other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the
room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to
another door, into a dark passageway, his wand held out in front
of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force.
“Reckon she’ll let me have a bit of the girl when she’s finished
with her?” Greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor.
“I’d say I’ll get a bite or two, wouldn’t you, ginger?”
Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep
flight of stairs, still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and
breaking their necks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy
door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced
them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness.
The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away
before there was a terrible, drawn out scream from directly above
them.
“HERMIONE!” Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and
struggle against the ropes tying them together, so that Harry staggered. “HERMIONE!”
“Be quiet!” Harry said. “Shut up. Ron, we need to work out a
way— “
“HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”
“We need a plan, stop yelling—we need to get these ropes off—
“
463
Chapter 23
“Harry?” came a whisper through the darkness. “Ron? Is that
you?”
Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close
by them, then Harry saw a shadow moving closer.
“Harry? Ron?”
“Luna?”
“Yes, it’s me! Oh no, I didn’t want you to be caught!”
“Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?” said Harry.
“Oh yes, I expect so. . . . There’s an old nail we use if we need
to break anything. . . . Just a moment . . . ”
Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear
Bellatrix screaming too, but her words were inaudible, for Ron
shouted again, “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”
“Mr. Ollivander?” Harry could hear Luna saying. “Mr. Ollivander, have you got the nail? If you just move over a little bit . . . I
think it was beside the water jug.”
She was back within seconds.
“You’ll need to stay still,” she said.
Harry could feel her digging at the rope’s tough fibers to work
the knots free. From upstairs they heard Bellatrix’s voice.
“I’m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword?
Where?”
“We found it—we found it—PLEASE!” Hermione screamed
again; Ron struggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped
onto Harry’s wrist.
“Ron, please stay still!” Luna whispered. “I can’t see what I’m
doing— “
“My pocket!” said Ron, “In my pocket, there’s a Deluminator,
and it’s full of light!”
464
Malfoy Manor
A few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent
spheres the Deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew
into the cellar: Unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung
there, like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with light.
Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless
figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the
corner. Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners:
Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept
standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans.
“Oh, that’s much easier, thanks, Ron,” said Luna, and she began hacking at their bindings again. “Hello, Dean!”
From above came Bellatrix’s voice.
“You’re lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been
inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth!”
Another terrible scream—
“HERMIONE!”
“What else did you take? What else have you got? Tel me the
truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!”
“There!”
Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to
see Ron running around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling,
searching for a trapdoor. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, said
“Thanks” to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank
onto the cellar floor, looking groggy and disoriented, many welts
across his swarthy face.
Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand.
“There’s no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his fruitless
efforts. “The cellar is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr.
Ollivander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything.”
465
Chapter 23
Hermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry
like physical pain. Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his
scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for
he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless.
“What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!”
Hermione’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half
sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrid’s pouch from around his neck and
groped inside it: He pulled out Dumbledore’s Snitch and shook it,
hoping for he did not know what—nothing happened—he waved
the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless— the
mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of
brightest blue—
Dumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror.
“Help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation. “We’re in the
cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!”
The eye blinked and was gone.
Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted
the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected
there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was
bellowing, “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”
“How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream.
“Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?”
“We only met him tonight!” Hermione sobbed. “We’ve never
been inside your vault. . . . It isn’t the real sword! It’s a copy, just
a copy!”
“A copy?” screeched Bellatrix. “Oh, a likely story!”
“But we can find out easily!” came Lucius’s voice. “Draco,
466
Malfoy Manor
fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!”
Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled
on the floor.
“Griphook,” he whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear, “you
must tell them that sword’s a fake, they mustn’t know it’s the real
one, Griphook, please— “
He could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps; next moment, Draco’s shaking voice spoke from behind the door.
“Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don’t try anything,
or I’ll kill you!”
They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked
the Deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket,
restoring the cellar’s darkness. The door flew open; Malfoy
marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out
again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and
at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar.
Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back
into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who
had just Apparated into their midst.
“DOB—!”
Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked
terrified at his mistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead:
Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix.
Dobby’s enormous, tennis—ball shaped eyes were wide; he was
trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the
home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified.
“Harry Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice,
“Dobby has come to rescue you.”
467
Chapter 23
“But how did you—?”
An awful scream drowned Harry’s words: Hermione was being
tortured again. He cut to the essentials.
“You can Disapparate out of this cellar?” he asked Dobby, who
nodded, his ears flapping.
“And you can take humans with you?”
Dobby nodded again.
“Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and take them— take them to— “
“Bill and Fleur’s,” said Ron. “Shell Cottage on the outskirts of
Tinworth!”
The elf nodded for a third time.
“And then come back,” said Harry. “Can you do that, Dobby?”
“Of course, Harry Potter,” whispered the little elf. He hurried
over to Mr. Ollivander, who appeared to be barely conscious. He
took one of the wandmaker’s hands in his own, then held out the
other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved.
“Harry, we want to help you!” Luna whispered.
“We can’t leave you here,” said Dean.
“Go, both of you! We’ll see you at Bill and Fleur’s.”
As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few
seconds he looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another
man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully.
“Kill me, then. Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death
will not bring you what you seek. . . . There is so much you do not
understand. . . .”
He felt Voldemort’s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he
shut it out, returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present.
“Go!” Harry beseeched to Luna and Dean. “Go! We’ll follow,
468
Malfoy Manor
just go!”
They caught hold of the elf’s outstretched fingers. There was
another loud crack, and Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished.
“What was that?” shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads.
“Did you hear that? What was that noise in the cellar?”
Harry and Ron stared at each other.
“Draco—no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!”
Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence.
Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for
more noises from the cellar.
“We’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he whispered to
Ron. They had no choice: The moment anyone entered the room
and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. “Leave the
lights on,” Harry added, and as they heard someone descending
the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either
side of it.
“Stand back,” came Wormtail’s voice. “Stand away from the
door. I’m coming in.” The door flew open. For a split second
Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light
from the three miniature suns floating in midair. Then Harry and
Ron launched themselves upon him. Ron seized Wormtail’s wand
arm and forced it upwards. Harry slapped a hand to his mouth,
muffling his voice. Silently they struggled: Wormtail’s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry’s throat.
“What is it, Wormtail?” called Lucius Malfoy from above.
“Nothing!” Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail’s wheezy voice. “All fine!”
Harry could barely breathe.
469
Chapter 23
“You’re going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to prise off
the metal fingers. “After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!”
The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He
wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail’s mouth. He saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen
with fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at
what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to
undo that moment of weakness.
“And we’ll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail’s
wand from his other hand.
Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew’s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes
had slid from Harry’s face to something else. His own silver fingers
were moving inexorably toward his own throat.
“No— “
Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand,
but there was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had
given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and
useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation,
his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.
“No!”
Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried
to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail’s throat,
but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue.
“Relashio!” said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand,
but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the
same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead.
Wormtail’s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last
twitch, and was still.
470
Malfoy Manor
Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail’s
body on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into
the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room. Cautiously
they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, which
was ajar. Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at
Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor’s sword in his long-fingered
hands. Hermione was lying at Bellatrix’s feet. She was barely
stirring.
“Well?” Bellatrix said to Griphook. “Is it the true sword?”
Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling
of his scar.
“No,” said Griphook. “It is a fake.”
“Are you sure?” panted Bellatrix. “Quite sure?”
“Yes,” said the goblin.
Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it.
“Good,” she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed
another deep cut into the goblin’s face, and he dropped with a yell
at her feet. She kicked him aside. “And now,” she said in a voice
that burst with triumph, “we call the Dark Lord!”
And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to
the Dark Mark.
At once, Harry’s scar felt as though it had split open again.
His true surroundings vanished: He was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt—he had warned them, he had told
them to summon him for nothing less than Potter. If they were
mistaken . . .
“Kill me, then!” demanded the old man. “You will not win,
you cannot win! That wand will never, ever be yours—“
471
Chapter 23
And Voldemort’s fury broke: A burst of green light filled the
prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed
and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort returned to the window,
his wrath barely controllable. . . . They would suffer his retribution
if they had no good reason for calling him back. . . .
“And I think,” said Bellatrix’s voice, “we can dispose of the
Mudblood. Greyback, take her if you want her.”
“NOOOOOOOOOOOO!”
Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around,
shocked; she turned her wand to face Ron instead—
“Expelliarmus!” he roared, pointing Wormtail’s wand at Bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and was caught by Harry, who had
sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, Draco and Greyback wheeled
about; Harry yelled, “Stupefy!” and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto
the hearth. Jets of light flew from Draco’s, Narcissa’s, and Greyback’s wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a
sofa to avoid them.
“STOP OR SHE DIES!
Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix
was supporting Hermione, who seemed to be unconscious, and was
holding her short silver knife to Hermione’s throat.
“Drop your wands,” she whispered. “Drop them, or we’ll see
exactly how filthy her blood is!”
Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail’s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix’s.
“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into
Hermione’s throat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there.
“All right!” he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix’s wand onto
the floor at his feet, Ron did the same with Wormtail’s. Both
472
Malfoy Manor
raised their hands to shoulder height.
“Good!” she leered. “Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is
coming, Harry Potter! Your death approaches!”
Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and
he could feel Voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over
a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to
Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out.
“Now,” said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with
the wands. “Cissy, I think we ought to tie these little heroes up
again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the
Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what
you have done tonight.”
At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above.
All of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier
tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to
fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she
threw herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the
floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor.
Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions; Draco doubled
over, his hands covering his bloody face.
As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took
the chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands
from Draco’s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled,
“Stupefy!” The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell,
flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground.
As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm,
Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair flying as she brandished the
silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway.
473
Chapter 23
“Dobby!” she screamed and even Bellatrix froze. “You! You
dropped the chandelier—?”
The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing
at his old mistress.
“You must not hurt Harry Potter,” he squeaked.
“Kill him, Cissy!” shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another
loud crack, and Narcissa’s wand too flew into the air and landed
on the other side of the room.
“You dirty little monkey!” bawled Bellatrix. “How dare you
take a witch’s wand, how dare you defy your masters?”
“Dobby has no master!” squealed the elf. “Dobby is a free elf,
and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!”
Harry’s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that
they had moments, seconds before Voldemort was with them.
“Ron, catch— and GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands
to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the
chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the
sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby’s hand and spun on
the spot to Disapparate.
As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the
streak of red that was Ron’s hair, and a blue of flying silver, as
Bellatrix’s knife flew across the room at the place where he was
vanishing—
Bill and Fleur’s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur’s . . .
He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice
to take him there. The pain in his forehead pierced him, and the
weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of
474
Malfoy Manor
Gryffindor’s sword bumping against his back: Dobby’s hand jerked
in his; he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge, to
pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers,
to indicate that that was fine with them. . . .
And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell
to his knees, relinquished Dobby’s hand, and attempted to lower
Griphook gently to the ground.
“Are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook
merely whimpered.
Harry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to
be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and he
thought he saw movement outside it.
“Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” he whispered, clutching the
two wands he had brought from the Malfoys’, ready to fight if he
needed to. “Have we come to the right place? Dobby?”
He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him.
“DOBBY!”
The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes.
Together, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife
protruding from the elf’s heaving chest.
“Dobby—no—HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!”
He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was
spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his
own arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him
and laid him sideways on the cool grass.
“Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die— ”
The elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort
475
Chapter 23
to form words.
“Harry . . . Potter . . . ”
And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and
his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with
light from the stars they could not see.
476
Chapter 24
The Wandmaker
I
t was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry
knelt again beside Dumbledore’s body at the foot of the
tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was staring at
a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife. Harry’s voice was still saying, “Dobby . . . Dobby . . . ”
even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call
him back.
After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come
to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna,
gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. “Hermione,” he
said suddenly. “Where is she?” “Ron’s taken her inside,” said
Bill. “She’ll be all right.” Harry looked back down at Dobby. He
stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf’s
body, then dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like
a blanket.
The sea was rushing against the rock somewhere nearby; Harry
listened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which he
could take no interest, making decisions, Dean carried the injured
477
Chapter 24
Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was
really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down
at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part
of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope,
he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at the
Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry’s grief for
Dobby seemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm
that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean.
“I want to do it properly,” were the first words of which Harry
was fully conscious of speaking. “Not by magic. Have you got a
spade?” And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging
the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the
garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the
manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his
sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their
lives.
His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet
was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut
his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted
him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to
possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his
thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby.
Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out . . . though Dumbledore, of
course, would have said that it was love.
On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth,
subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the
darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the
rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at
the Malfoys’ returned to him, the things he had heard came back
478
The Wandmaker
to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness . . .
The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts.
Hallows . . . Horcruxes . . . Hallows . . . Horcruxes . . . yet no longer
burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had
snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been slapped awake again.
Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew
where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the
topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why . . .
And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy . . . Dumbledore had foreseen that . . . How
much more had he known?
Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had
lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean.
“How’s Hermione?” “Better,” said Ron. “Fleur’s looking after
her.” Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he
had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did
not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with
spades of their own and together they worked in silence until the
hole seemed deep enough.
Harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on
the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he
placed on the elf’s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which
Harry placed carefully upon Dobby’s head, muffling his batlike
ears. “We should close his eyes.”
Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness.
Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from
the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized
to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing
gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her
479
Chapter 24
when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur’s
coats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of
the elf’s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. “There,” she
said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.”
Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so
that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for
the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break
down as he remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and
rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row,
the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the
white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a
funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug
hole. “I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll
go first, shall I?”
And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at
the bottom of the grave. “Thank you so much Dobby for rescuing
me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die when you
were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us.
I hope you’re happy now.”
She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared
his throat and said in a thick voice, “yeah . . . thanks Dobby.”
“Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. “Good bye Dobby,”
he said It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for
him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave
rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound.
“D’ya mind if I stay here a moment?” He asked the others.
They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats
upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage,
leaving Harry alone beside the elf.
480
The Wandmaker
He looked around: There were a number of large white stones,
smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He
picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place
where Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a
wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he
could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to
remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the
shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it
at the rock.
Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared
upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done
it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark
the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up
again, the stone read:
HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.
He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked
away, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of those things
that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in
the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible.
They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the
little hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The
room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon
the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening.
“ . . . lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at Hogwarts
they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know
she’s safe too.” He looked around and saw Harry standing there.
“I’ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,” he explained.
481
Chapter 24
“Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters know Ron’s with
you now, they’re bound to target the family—don’t apologize,” he
added at the sight of Harry’s expression. “It was always a matter
of time, Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest blood
traitor family there is.”
“How are they protected?” asked Harry. “Fidelius Charm.
Dad’s Secret-Keeper. And we’ve done it on this cottage too; I’m
Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that’s hardly
the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are
well enough, we’ll move them to Muriel’s too. There isn’t much
room here, but she’s got plenty. Griphook’s legs are on the mend.
Fleur’s given him Skele-Gro—we could probably move them in an
hour or— “
“No,” Harry said and Bill looked startled. “I need both of
them here. I need to talk to them. It’s important.” He heard
the authority of his own voice, the conviction, the voice of purpose
that had come to him as he dug Dobby’s grave. All of their faces
were turned toward him looking puzzled.
“I’m going to wash,” Harry told Bill looking down at his hands
still covered with mud and Dobby’s blood. “Then I’ll need to see
them, straight away.” He walked into the little kitchen, to the
basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking
over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again
following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark
garden . . .
Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to
the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye
had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come.
Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
482
The Wandmaker
Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene
outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the
sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this
dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all.
And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was
getting there too. Harry understood and yet did not understand.
His instinct was telling him one thing, his brain quite another. The
Dumbledore in Harry’s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips
of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer.
You gave Ron the Deluminator . . . You understood him. . . . You
gave him a way back . . .
And you understood Wormtail too. . . . You knew there was a bit
of regret there, somewhere. . . .
And if you knew them . . . What did you know about me, Dumbledore?
Am I meant to know but not to seek? Did you know how hard
I’d feel that? Is that why you made it this difficult? So I’d have
time to work that out?
Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a
bright gold ray of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he
looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to
see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned
to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and then
flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over
water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well.
Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs.
“I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,” Harry said.
“No,” said Fleur. “You will ’ave to wait, ’Arry. Zey are both
too tired— ”
483
Chapter 24
“I’m sorry,” he said without heat, “but it can’t wait. I need to
talk to them now. Privately— and separately. It’s urgent.”
“Harry, what the hell’s going on?” asked Bill. “You turn up
here with a dead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione
looks as though she’s been tortured, and Ron’s just refused to tell
me anything— ”
“We can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said Harry flatly. “You’re
in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We’re
not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.”
Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he
was staring at Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read.
Finally, Bill said, “All right. Who do you want to talk to first?”
Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was
hardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or
Hallows?
“Griphook,” Harry said. “I’ll speak to Griphook first.”
His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just
cleared an enormous obstacle.
“Up here, then,” said Bill, leading the way.
Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking
back.
“I need you two as well!” he called to Ron and Hermione, who
had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting
room.
They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved.
“How are you?” Harry asked Hermione. “You were amazing—
coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that— ”
Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed
squeeze.
484
The Wandmaker
“What are we doing now, Harry?” he asked.
“You’ll see. Come on.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto
a small landing. Three doors led off it.
“In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur’s room,
it too had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise.
Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the spectacular
view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione
took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.
Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down
carefully upon the bed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left,
closing the door upon them all.
“I’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said Harry. “How are your
legs?”
“Painful,” replied the goblin. “But mending.”
He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a
strange look: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin’s sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had
removed his shoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a
house-elf, but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than
a human’s.
“You probably don’t remember— ” Harry began.
“— that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first
time you ever visited Gringotts?” said Griphook. “I remember,
Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.”
Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other
up. Harry’s scar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this
interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid
of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way
485
Chapter 24
to approach his request, the goblin broke the silence.
“You buried the elf,” he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous.
“I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.”
“Yes,” said Harry.
Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black
eyes.
“You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.”
“In what way?” asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently.
“You dug the grave.”
“So?”
Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being
sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not matter to him
whether Griphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not. He gathered
himself for the attack.
“Griphook, I need to ask— ”
“You also rescued a goblin.”
“What?”
“You brought me here. Saved me.”
“Well, I take it you’re not sorry?” said Harry a little impatiently.
“No, Harry Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger he
twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very
odd wizard.”
“Right,” said Harry. “Well, I need some help, Griphook, and
you can give it to me.”
The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to
frown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him.
“I need to break into a Gringotts vault.”
Harry had not meant to say it so badly: the words were forced
486
The Wandmaker
from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again,
the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to
deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry
as though he had gone mad.
“Harry— ” said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook.
“Break into a Gringotts vault?” repeated the goblin, wincing a
little as he shifted his position upon the bed. “It is impossible.”
“No, it isn’t,” Ron contradicted him. “It’s been done.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “The same day I first met you, Griphook.
My birthday, seven years ago.”
“The vault in question was empty at the time,” snapped the
goblin, and Harry understood that even though Griphook had
let Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being
breached. “Its protection was minimal.”
“Well, the vault we need to get into isn’t empty, and I’m guessing its protection will be pretty powerful,” said Harry. “It belongs
to the Lestranges.”
He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but
there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given
his answer.
“You have no chance,” said Griphook flatly. “No chance at all.
If you seek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours — ”
“Thief, you have been warned, beware —yeah, I know, I remember,” said Harry. “But I’m not trying to get myself any treasure,
I’m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe
that?”
The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on
Harry’s forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation.
487
Chapter 24
“If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not
seek personal gain,” said Griphook finally, “it would be you, Harry
Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the
respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.”
“Wand-carriers,” repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon
his ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts
northward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door.
“The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, “has long
been contested between wizards and goblins.”
“Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said Ron.
“That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of
wandlore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility
of extending our powers!”
“Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” said Ron.
“You won’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do.
Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never— ”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry, noting Griphook’s rising color.
“This isn’t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature— ”
Griphook gave a nasty laugh.
“But it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes
ever more powerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine!
Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered,
and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?”
“We do!” said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes
bright. “We protest! And I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin
or elf, Griphook! I’m a Mudblood!”
“Don’t call yourself— ” Ron muttered.
“Why shouldn’t I?” said Hermione. “Mudblood, and proud of
488
The Wandmaker
it! I’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have,
Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys!”
As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to
reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat.
“Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?” she
asked. “Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for
years?” (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione’s
chair.) “You can’t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we
do, Griphook!”
The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had
shown Harry.
“What do you seek within the Lestranges’ vault?” he asked
abruptly. “The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real
one.” He looked from one to the other of them. “I think that you
already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.”
“But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it?”
asked Harry. “Perhaps you’ve seen other things in there?”
His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his
efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar.
The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again.
“It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We
are the guardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the
objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our
fingers.”
The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from
Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back again.
“So young,” he said finally, “to be fighting so many.”
“Will you help us?” said Harry. “We haven’t got a hope of
breaking in without a goblin’s help. You’re our one chance.”
489
Chapter 24
“I shall . . . think about it,” said Griphook maddeningly.
“But— ” Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs.
“Thank you,” said Harry.
The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement,
then flexed his short legs.
“I think,” he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and
Fleur’s bed, “that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be
able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .”
“Yeah, of course,” said Harry, but before leaving the room he
leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the
goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him.
“Little git,” whispered Ron. “He’s enjoying keeping us hanging.”
“Harry,” whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from
the door, into the middle of the still-dark landing, “are you saying
what I think you’re saying? Are you saying there’s a Horcrux in
the Lestranges vault?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “Bellatrix was terrified when she thought
we’d been in there, she was beside herself. Why? What did
she think we’d seen, what else did she think we might have
taken? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find
out about.”
“But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who’s
been, places he’s done something important?” said Ron, looking
baffled. “Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault?”
“I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,” said
Harry. “He never had gold there when he was younger, because
nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the
490
The Wandmaker
outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.”
Harry’s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and
Hermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander.
“I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a
Gringotts vault. I think he’d have seen it as a real symbol of
belonging to the Wizarding world. And don’t forget, he trusted
Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants
before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished. He
said it night he came back, I heard him.”
Harry rubbed his scar.
“I don’t think he’d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though.
He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably
told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in
her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to
hide, Hagrid told me . . . except for Hogwarts.”
When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head.
“You really understand him.”
“Bits of him,” said Harry. “Bits . . . I just wish I’d understood
Dumbledore as much. But we’ll see. Come on—Ollivander now.”
Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but very impressed as
they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the
door opposite Bill and Fleur’s. A weak “Come in!” answered them.
The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the
window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and
tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated,
the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin.
His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands
that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry
491
Chapter 24
sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising
sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and
the freshly dug grave.
“Mr. Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said.
“My dear boy,” Ollivander’s voice was feeble. “You rescued us, I
thought we would die in that place, I can never thank you . . . never
thank you . . . enough.”
“We were glad to do it.”
Harry’s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was
hardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or
else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic . . . yet he
had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first.
Feigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his
neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand.
“Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.”
“Anything. Anything.” Said the wandmaker weakly.
“Can you mend this? Is it possible?”
Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two
barely connected halves in his palm.
“Holly and phoenix feather,” said Ollivander in a tremulous
voice. “Eleven inches. Nice and supple.”
“Yes,” said Harry. “Can you—?”
“No,” whispered Ollivander. “I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand
that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any
means that I know of.”
Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless.
He took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch
around his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered
wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken
492
The Wandmaker
from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys’.
“Can you identify these?” Harry asked.
The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close
to his faded eyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers,
flexing it slightly.
“Walnut and dragon heartstring,” he said. “Twelve-and-threequarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix
Lestrange.”
“And this one?”
Ollivander performed the same examination.
“Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably
springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.”
“Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn’t it still his?”
“Perhaps not. If you took it— ”
“— I did— ”
“— then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking
matters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general,
however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.”
There was a silence in the room, except for the distant rushing
of the sea.
“You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings,” said Harry,
“like they can think for themselves.”
“The wand chooses the wizard,” said Ollivander. “That much
has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.”
“A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them,
though?” asked Harry.
“Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. The best results,
however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity
493
Chapter 24
between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand
learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.”
The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound.
“I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said Harry.
“Can I use it safely?”
“I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.”
“So I should use this one?” said Ron, pulling Wormtail’s wand
out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander.
“Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches.
Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for
Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your
bidding, and do it well, than another wand.”
“And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked Harry.
“I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon
Harry’s face. “You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore
is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.”
“So, it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take the
possession of a wand?” asked Harry.
Ollivander swallowed.
“Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.”
“There are legends, though,” said Harry, and as his heart rate
quickened, the pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure
that Voldemort has decided to put his idea into action. “Legends
about a wand— or wands— that have been passed from hand to
hand by murder.”
Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light
gray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with
494
The Wandmaker
what looked like fear.
“Only one wand, I think,” he whispered.
“And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn’t he?” asked Harry.
“I—how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at
Ron and Hermione for help. “How do you know this?”
“He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection
between our wands,” said Harry.
Ollivander looked terrified.
“He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus
Curse, I–I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I
guessed!”
“I understand,” said Harry. “You told him about the twin
cores? You said he just had to borrow another wizard’s wand?”
Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that
Harry knew. He nodded slowly.
“But it didn’t work,” Harry went on. “Mine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you know why that is?”
Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded.
“I had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed
something unique that night. The connection of the twin cores
is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would have snapped the
borrowed wand, I do not know. . . .
“We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes
hands by murder. When You-Know-Who realized my wand had
done something strange, he came back and asked about that other
wand, didn’t he?”
“How do you know this?”
Harry did not answer.
“Yes, he asked,” whispered Ollivander. “He wanted to know
495
Chapter 24
everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the
Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.”
Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted.
“The Dark Lord,” said Ollivander in hushed and frightened
tones, “had always been happy with the wand I made him—yew
and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches—until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more
powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.”
“But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that mine’s broken
beyond repair,” said Harry quietly.
“No!” said Hermione, sounding frightened. “He can’t know
that, Harry, how could he—?”
“Priori Incantatem,” said Harry. “We left your wand and the
blackthorn wand at the Malfoys’, Hermione. If they examine them
properly, make them re-create the spells they’ve cast lately, they’d
see that yours broke mine, they’ll see that you tried and failed to
mend it, and they’ll realize that I’ve been using the blackthorn one
ever since.”
The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained
from her face. Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, “Let’s
not worry about that now— ”
But Mr. Ollivander intervened.
“The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your
destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he
believes it will make him truly invulnerable.”
“And will it?”
“The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,” said
Ollivander, “but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the
Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable.”
496
The Wandmaker
Harry was suddenly reminded of how unsure, when they first
met, of how much he like Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark Wizard
in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it
repulsed him.
“You—you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?” asked Hermione.
“Oh yes,” said Ollivander. “Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace
the wand’s course through history. There are gaps, of, course, and
long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden;
but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics
that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers
have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.”
“So you—you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?”
Hermione asked hopefully.
“No,” said Ollivander. “Whether it needs to pass by murder,
I do not know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due
to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such
passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong
hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study
the power of wands.”
“Mr. Ollivander,” said Harry, “you told You-Know-Who that
Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you?”
Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as
he gulped.
“But how—how do you—?”
“Never mind how I know it,” said Harry, closing his eyes mo497
Chapter 24
mentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision
of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much
farther north. “You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had
the wand?”
“It was a rumor,” whispered Ollivander. “A rumor, years and
years ago, long before you were born I believe Gregorovitch himself
started it. You can see how good it would be for business; that he
was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!”
“Yes, I can see that,” said Harry. He stood up. “Mr. Ollivander,
one last thing, and then we’ll let you get some rest. What do you
know about the Deathly Hallows?”
“The— the what?” asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered.
“The Deathly Hallows.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about. Is this still
something to do with wands?”
Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander
was not acting. He did not know about the Hallows.
“Thank you,” said Harry. “Thank you very much. We’ll leave
you to get some rest now.”
Ollivander looked stricken.
“He was torturing me!” he gasped. “The Cruciatus
Curse . . . you have no idea. . . .”
“I do,” said Harry, “I really do. Please get some rest. Thank
you for telling me all of this.”
He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught
glimpses of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the
kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry
as he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and
498
The Wandmaker
continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The
reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry
walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more
powerfully. It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that
were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have
to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he
needed to know that his theory was right. He must make only one
more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione.
“Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,” he said,
“I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him
down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it anymore: It was
stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that
Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know—but if Gregorovitch was stupid
enough to spread the rumor, it can’t have been that difficult.”
Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him
standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn,
coming closer and closer.
“And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful.
And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was
the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat
him, and he took the Elder Wand.”
“Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?” said Ron. “But then—
where is it now?”
“At Hogwarts,” said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the
cliff-top garden.
“But then, let’s go!” said Ron urgently. “Harry, let’s go and
get it before he does!”
“It’s too late for that,” said Harry. He could not help himself,
but clutched his head, trying to help it resist. “He knows where it
499
Chapter 24
is. He’s there now.”
“Harry!” Ron said furiously. “How long have you known this—
why have we been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook
first? We could have gone—we could still go— ”
“No,” said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. “Hermione’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t
want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.”
“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” moaned Ron.
“I’m not supposed to . . . I’m supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . .”
And now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely
visible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through
the grounds toward the lake.
“I shall join you in the castle shortly,” he said in his high, cold
voice. “Leave me now.”
Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape’s figure
to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to
see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast
upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his
own eyes.
And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the
outlines of the beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright. . . .
And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters.
The white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that heady
sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How
fitting that this would be its last great act.
500
The Wandmaker
The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure
was as long as thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again.
The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale,
sunken, yet almost perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose: He felt amused derision. Dumbledore’s
hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath
them, buried with him.
Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect
the wand? Had he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared
to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the
wand from Dumbledore’s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of
sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner,
ready to serve a new master at last.
501
Chapter 25
Shell Cottage
B
ill and Fleur’s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever
Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he
could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing
of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next
few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving
the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of
cold, salty wind on his face.
The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand
still scared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing
not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help
voicing whenever they were together.
“What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in
time to get the wand?” “What if working out what the symbol
meant made you ‘worthy’ to get the Hallows?” “Harry, if that
really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish
off You-Know-Who?”
502
Shell Cottage
Harry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent
Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain
satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried
to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision,
they sounded feebler to him.
The odd thing was that Hermione’s support made him feel just
as confused as Ron’s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder
Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that
the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to
be considered.
“You could never have done that, Harry,” she said again and
again. “You couldn’t have broken into Dumbledore’s grave.”
But the idea of Dumbledore’s corpse frightened Harry much less
than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living
Dumbledore’s intentions. He felt that he was still groping in the
dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering
whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have
taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore
crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves
against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had
not explained before he died.
“But is he dead?” said Ron, three days after they had arrived
at the cottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that
separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to
join in with their argument.
“Yes, he is. Ron, please don’t start that again!”
“Look at the facts, Hermione,” said Ron, speaking across Harry,
503
Chapter 25
who continued to gaze at the horizon. “The silver doe. The sword.
The eye Harry saw in the mirror— ”
“Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don’t you,
Harry?”
“I could have,” said Harry without looking at her.
“But you don’t think you did, do you?” asked Ron.
“No, I don’t,” said Harry.
“There you go!” said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry
on. “If it wasn’t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were
in the cellar, Hermione?”
“I can’t—but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us
if he’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?” “I dunno, it could’ve been
his ghost!”
“Dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said Harry.
There was little about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he
knew that much. “He would have gone on.”
“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” asked Ron, but before Harry
could say any more, a voice behind them said, “’Arry?”
Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in
the breeze.
“’Arry, Grip’ook would like to speak to you. ’E eez in ze smallest bedroom, ’e says ’e does not want to be over’eard.”
Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was
clear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house.
Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest
of the cottage’s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept
by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright,
cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest
of the airy, light cottage.
504
Shell Cottage
“I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,” said the goblin,
who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms
with his spindly fingers. “Though the goblins of Gringotts will
consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you— ”
“That’s great!” said Harry, relief surging through him. “Griphook, thank you, we’re really— ”
“—in return,” said the goblin firmly, “for payment.”
Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated.
“How much do you want? I’ve got gold.”
“Not gold,” said Griphook. “I have gold.”
His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes.
“I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.”
Harry’s spirits plummeted.
“You can’t have that,” he said. “I’m sorry.”
“Then,” said the goblin softly, “we have a problem.”
“We can give you something else,” said Ron eagerly. “I’ll bet
the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once
we get into the vault.”
He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily.
“I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to
which I have no right!”
“The sword’s ours— ”
“It is not,” said the goblin. “We’re Gryffindors, and it was
Godric Gryffindor’s— ”
“And before it was Gryffindor’s, whose was it?” demanded the
goblin, sitting up straight.
“No one’s,” said Ron. “It was made for him, wasn’t it?”
“No!” cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a
long finger at Ron. “Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was
505
Chapter 25
Ragnuk the First’s, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is
a lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the
goblins. The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!”
Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then
said, “We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that’s all right. Could
you give us a few minutes?”
The goblin nodded, looking sour.
Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the
fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him,
Ron said, “He’s having a laugh. We can’t let him have that sword.”
“It is true?” Harry asked Hermione. “Was the sword stolen by
Gryffindor?”
“I don’t know,” she said hopelessly. “Wizarding history often
skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but
there’s no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the
sword.”
“It’ll be one of those goblin stories,” said Ron, “about how the
wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we
should think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.”
“Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron.” said
Hermione. “They’ve been treated brutally in the past.”
“Goblins aren’t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?”
said Ron. “They’ve killed plenty of us. They’ve fought dirty too.”
“But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us,
is it?”
There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the
problem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby’s grave. Luna
was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone.
506
Shell Cottage
“Okay,” said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, “how’s
this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the
vault and then he can have it. There’s a fake in these, isn’t there?
We switch them, and give him the fake.”
“Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would!” said
Hermione. “He’s the only one who realized there had been a swap!”
“Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes— ”
He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him.
“That,” she said quietly, “is despicable. Ask for his help, then
double-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don’t like wizards,
Ron?”
Ron’s ears had turned red.
“All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of!
What’s your solution, then?”
“We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.”
“Brilliant, I’ll go and get one of our ancient goblin-made swords
and you can gift wrap it.”
Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin
would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as
valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable
weapon against the Horcruxes.
He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the
rush of the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen
the sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to
be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggleborns, the wizard who had clashed with the pureblood-loving
Slytherin. . . .
“Maybe he’s lying,” Harry said, opening his eyes again. “Grip507
Chapter 25
hook. Maybe Gryffindor didn’t take the sword. How do we know
the goblin version of history’s right?”
“Does it make a difference?” asked Hermione. “Changes how I
feel about it,” said Harry.
He took a deep breath.
“We’ll tell him he can have the sword after he’s helped us get
into that vault—but we’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly
when he can have it.”
A grin spread slowly across Ron’s face. Hermione, however,
looked alarmed.
“Harry, we can’t— ”
“He can have it,” Harry went on, “after we’ve used it on all of
the Horcruxes. I’ll make sure he gets it then. I’ll keep my word.”
“But that could be years!” said Hermione. “I know that, but
he needn’t. I won’t be lying . . . really.”
Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He
remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway
to Nurmengard: For the Greater Good. He pushed the idea
away. What choice did they have?
“I don’t like it,” said Hermione.
“Nor do I, much,” Harry admitted.
“Well, I think it’s genius,” said Ron, standing up again. “Let’s
go and tell him.”
Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to
phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of
the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking;
he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away.
However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry.
“I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the
508
Shell Cottage
sword of Gryffindor if I help you?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand.
Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes
saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him,
clapped his hands together, and said, “So. We begin!”
It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again.
They settled to work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept,
according to Griphook’s preference, in semidarkness.
“I have visited the Lestranges’ vault only once,” Griphook told
them, “on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword.
It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding
families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults
are largest and best protected. . . .”
They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a
time. Slowly the days stretched into weeks. There was problem
after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store
of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted.
“There’s really only enough left for one of us,” said Hermione,
tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight.
“That’ll be enough,” said Harry, who was examining Griphook’s
hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways.
The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill’s eyes on the three of them at the table,
thoughtful, concerned.
The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he
did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly blood509
Chapter 25
thirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed
to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards
to reach the Lestranges’ vault. Harry could tell that his distaste
was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it. They
needed Griphook.
The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even
after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food
in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an
angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them
at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food,
insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi.
Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted
that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question
him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into
hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer
work.
“I’m sorry,” he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he
helped her prepare dinner. “I never meant you to have to deal
with all of this.”
She had just set some knives to work, chipping up steaks for
Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since
he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced behind
her, her somewhat irritable expression softened.
“’Arry, you saved my sister’s life, I do not forget.”
This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against
reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger.
“Anyway,” Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on
the stove, which began to bubble at once, “Mr. Ollivander leaves
510
Shell Cottage
for Muriel’s zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze goblin,”
she scowled a little at the mention of him, “can move downstairs,
and you, Ron, and Dean can take zat room.”
“We don’t mind sleeping in the living room,” said Harry, who
knew that Griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the
sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. “Don’t
worry about us.” And when she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll
be off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won’t need
to be here much longer.”
“But, what do you mean?” she said, frowning at him, her wand
pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. “Of course
you must not leave, you are safe ’ere!”
She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was
glad that the back door opened at that moment. Luna and Dean
entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full
of driftwood.
“ . . . and tiny little ears,” Luna was saying, “a bit like hippo’s,
Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them,
you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast. . . .”
Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed,
following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where
Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance
to escape Fleur’s questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin
juice and followed them.
“ . . . and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to show
you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven’t seen it
yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express
and I never got home for Christmas,” Luna was saying, as she and
Dean relit the fire.
511
Chapter 25
“Luna, we told you,” Hermione called over to her. “That horn
exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned
Snorkack— ”
“No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,” said Luna serenely,
“Daddy told me. It will probably have re–formed by now, they
mend themselves, you know.”
Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as
Bill appeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as
the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase.
“I’m going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,” said Luna, approaching the old man.
“And I you, my dear,” said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. “You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible
place.”
“So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,” said Fleur, kissing him on both
cheeks. “And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering
a package to Bill’s Auntie Muriel!? I never returned ’er tiara.”
“It will be an honor,” said Ollivander with a little bow, “the
very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.”
Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show
the wandmaker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light
from the low-hanging lamp.
“Moonstones and diamonds,” said Griphook, who had sidled
into the room without Harry noticing. “Made by goblins, I think?”
“And paid for by wizards,” said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot
him a look that was both furtive and challenging.
A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and
Ollivander set off into the night. The rest of them squeezed in
512
Shell Cottage
around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to
move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the
grate beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with
her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; however,
Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long
hair tangled by the wind.
“Everything’s fine,” he told Fleur. “Ollivander settled in, Mum
and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love, Fred and George
are driving Muriel up the wall, they’re still operating an Owl-Order
business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara
back, though. She said she thought we’d stolen it.”
“Ah, she eez charmante, your aunt,” said Fleur crossly, waving
her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in
midair. She caught them and marched out of the room.
“Daddy’s made a tiara,” piped up Luna, “Well, more of a crown,
really.”
Ron caught Harry’s eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was
remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit
to Xenophilius.
“Yes, he’s trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He
thinks he’s identified most of the main elements now. Adding the
billywig wings really made a difference— ”
There was a bang on the front door. Everyone’s head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened;
Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron,
and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath
the table, out of sight.
“Who is it?” Bill called.
“It is I, Remus John Lupin!” called a voice over the howling
513
Chapter 25
wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened?
“I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the
Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me
come in an emergency!”
“Lupin,” muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched
it open.
Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in
a traveling cloak, his graying hair windswept. He straightened up,
looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried
aloud, “It’s a boy! We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s father!”
Hermione shrieked.
“Wha—? Tonks—Tonks has had the baby?”
“Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” shouted Lupin. All around the
table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both
squealed, “Congratulations!” and Ron said, “Blimey, a baby!” as
if he had never heard of such a thing before.
“Yes—yes— a boy,” said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by
his own happiness. He strode around the table and hugged Harry;
the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never have
happened.
“You’ll be godfather?” he said as he released Harry. “M–me?”
stammered Harry.
“You, yes, of course—Dora quite agrees, no one better— ”
“I—yeah—blimey— ”
Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was
hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join
them for a drink.
“I can’t stay long, I must get back,” said Lupin, beaming around
at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him.
514
Shell Cottage
“Thank you, thank you, Bill”
Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised
them high in a toast.
“To Teddy Remus Lupin,” said Lupin, “a great wizard in the
making!”
“’Oo does ’e look like?” Fleur inquired.
“I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not
much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it’s
turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blond by the time I get
back. Andromeda says Tonks’s hair started changing color the day
that she was born.” He drained his goblet. “Oh, go on then, just
one more,” he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again.
The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin’s news
seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for
a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive
atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he
now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had
noticed this, until he saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up the
stairs.
“No . . . no . . . I really must get back,” said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled
his traveling cloak back around himself.
“Good-bye, good-bye— I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few
day’s time— they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen you— ”
He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women
and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned
into the wild night.

Chapter 25
“Godfather, Harry!” said Bill as they walked into the kitchen
together, helping clear the table. “A real honor! Congratulations!”
As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill
pulled the door behind him closed, shutting out the still-voluble
voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in
Lupin’s absence.
“I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t been easy
to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.”
Bill hesitated.
“Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook.”
It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother
to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting.
“I know goblins,” said Bill. “I’ve worked for Gringotts ever
since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between
wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends— or, at least, goblins I
know well, and like.” Again, Bill hesitated.
“Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you
promised him in return?”
“I can’t tell you that,” said Harry. “Sorry, Bill.”
The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring
through more empty goblets.
“Wait,” Bill told her, “Just a moment.”
She backed out and he closed the door again.
“Then I have to say this,” Bill went on. “If you have struck any
kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin
notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same
as human ones.”
Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake
516
Shell Cottage
had stirred inside him.
“What do you mean?” he asked.
“We are talking about a different breed of being,” said Bill.
“Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for
centuries—but you’ll know all that from History of Magic. There
has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have
been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and
those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no
respect for goblin ownership.”
“I respect— ” Harry began, but Bill shook his head.
“You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless
they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true
master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin
made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.”
“But it was bought— ”
“— then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid
the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea of
goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook’s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves.
I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ought to
have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died.
They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing
them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more
than theft.”
Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill
guessed more than he was letting on.
“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the door back
into the sitting room, “is to be very careful what you promise gob517
Chapter 25
lins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts
than to renege on a promise to a goblin.”
“Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah. Thanks.
I’ll bear that in mind.” As he followed Bill back to the others a
wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had drunk.
He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to
Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him.
518
Chapter 26
Gringotts
T
heir plans were made, their preparations complete; in
the smallest bedroom a single long, coarse black hair
(plucked from the sweater Hermione had been wearing
at Malfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on
the mantelpiece.
“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said Harry, nodding
toward the walnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll be pretty convincing.”
Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit
her as she picked it up.
“I hate that thing,” she said in a low voice. “I really hate it. It
feels all wrong, it doesn’t work properly for me . . . It’s like a bit of
her.”
Harry could not help but remember how Hermione has dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was
imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling
him to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back
to her, however, the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts
felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her.
519
Chapter 26
“It’ll probably help you get in character, though,” said Ron.
“think what that wand’s done!”
“But that’s my point!” said Hermione. “This is the wand that
tortured Neville’s mum and dad, and who knows how many other
people? This is the wand that killed Sirius!”
Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand
and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with
Gryffindor’s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him.
“I miss my wand,” Hermione said miserably. “I wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me another one too.”
Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She
was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities
in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the
Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily.
Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased to
discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione’s had
done. Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret
workings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione’s problem was: She had not won the walnut wand’s allegiance by taking
it personally from Bellatrix.
The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry
reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to
him, but regretted his action at once. He could tell that the goblin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said,
“We’ve just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We’ve
told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving tomorrow, and we’ve told them
not to get up to see us off.”
They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would
520
Gringotts
need to transform in Bellatrix before they left, and the less that
Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to
do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be
returning. As they had lost Perkin’s old tent on the night that the
Snatcher’s caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was
now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to
learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple
expedient of stuffing it down her sock.
Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to
mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few
weeks, Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of
Shell Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they were
not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most
of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how
and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over
Gryffindor’s sword remained a question to which Harry had no
answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going
to do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione
alone together for more than five minutes at a time: “He could
give my mother lessons,” growled Ron, as the goblin’s long fingers
kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill’s warning in
mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the
watch for possible skulduggery. Hermione disapproved so heartily
of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up attempting
to pick her brains on how best to do it: Ron, on the rare occasions
that they had been able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments,
had come up with nothing better than “We’ll just have to wing it,
mate.”
Harry slept badly that night. Lying away in the early hours,
521
Chapter 26
he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had
infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination,
almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety
nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all
going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was
good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were
well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter,
yet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was
sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room
with Dean, so Harry did not speak.
It was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could slip out
of their sleeping bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out
into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook.
The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was
May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the
dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward
against the cliff: He was going to miss the sound.
Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red
earth of Dobby’s grave now, in a year’s time the mound would
be covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf’s name
had already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they
could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but
Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking
down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known
where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved absentmindedly
to the little pouch still strung around his neck, thorough which he
could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure
he had seen Dumbledore’s eye. Then the sound of a door opening
made him look around.
522
Gringotts
Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them,
accompanied by Griphook. As she walked, she was tucking the
small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old
robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew
perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress
a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black
hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as
they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione
through Bellatrix’s low voice.
“She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron,
come here so I can do you. . . .”
“Right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long”
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, this isn’t about looking handsome”
“It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit
shorter, try and do it the way you did last time.”
Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath
as she transformed various aspects of Ron’s appearance. He was
to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to
the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile
Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility
Cloak.
“There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?”
It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only,
Harry thought, because he knew him so well. Ron’s hair was now
long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no
freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.
“Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do,” said Harry. “Shall we
go, then?”
All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and
523
Chapter 26
silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward
the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Chard
stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past
the gate, Griphook spoke.
“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?”
Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his
hands linked on front of Harry’s throat. He was not heavy, but
Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength
with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out
of the beaded bag and threw it over them both.
“Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s feet. “I
can’t see a thing. Let’s go.”
Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that
was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter
as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later
Harry’s feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing
Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions
of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn’s existence.
The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Ton, the
stooped and toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the
bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in
the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows.
“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione paused
he inclined his head subserviently.
“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still
carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look
surprised.
“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed
524
Gringotts
out of the Inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people
like they’re scum!”
“Okay, okay!”
Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and rapped a brick in the
nondescript wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to
whirl and spin: A hole appeared in the middle of them, which
grew wider and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow
cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.
It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were
hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much
altered now from the bustling place Harry had visited before his
first team at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever
were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to
the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit. Harry’s own
face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows,
always captioned with the words undesirable number one.
A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard
them moaning to the few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting
that they were really wizards. One man had a bloody bandage
over his eye.
As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione.
They seemed to melt away before her, drawing hoods over their
faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after them
curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering
right across her path.
“My children,” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was
cracked, high-pitched, he sounded distraught. “Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, you know!”
“I–I really— ” stammered Hermione.
525
Chapter 26
The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat. Then, with a
bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the
ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched
and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at
the windows on either side of the street, while a little knot of
prosperous-looking passerby gathered their robes about them and
broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene.
Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more
conspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not
be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. Before
they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry
from behind them.
“Why, Madam Lestrange!”
Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around
Harry’s neck: A tall, think wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair
and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them.
“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into Harry’s ear, but at that
moment Harry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had
drawn herself up to full height and said with as much contempt as
she could muster:
“And what do you want?”
Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.
“He’s another Death Eater!” breathed Griphook, and Harry
sidled sideways to repeat the information into Hermione’s ear.
“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, “but if my
presence is not welcome . . . ”
Harry recognized his voice now: Travers was one of the Death
Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.
“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said Hermione quickly, trying to
526
Gringotts
cover up her mistake. “How are you?”
“Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix.”
“Really? Why?” asked Hermione.
“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the Inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house, after the . . . ah . . . escape.”
Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and
Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public—
“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,” said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix’s most contemptuous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not
as good with him as mine is, Travers.”
Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less
suspicious. He glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned.
“How did it offend you?”
“It does not matter, it will not do so again,” said Hermione
coolly.
“Some of these wandless can be troublesome,” said Travers.
“While they do nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of
them actually asked me to plead her case in the Ministry last week.
‘I’m a witch, sir, I’m a witch, let me prove it to you!’” he said
in a squeaky impersonation. “As if I was going to give her my
wand—but whose wand,” said Travers curiously, “are you using
at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was— ”
“I have my wand here,” said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix’s wand. “I don’t know what rumors you have been listening
to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed.”
Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron.
527
Chapter 26
“Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.”
“This is Dragomir Despard,” said Hermione; they had decided
that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume.
“He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark
Lord’s aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new
regime.”
“Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?”
“’Ow you?” said Ron, holding out his hand.
Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron’s hand as though
frightened of dirtying himself.
“So what brings you and your— ah— sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?” asked Travers.
“I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione.
“Alas, I also,” said Travers. “Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live
without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with
our long-fingered friends.”
Harry felt Griphook’s clasped hands tighten momentarily
around his neck.
“Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward.
Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and
head along the crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the
snowy-white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops.
Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed.
A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed,
and the worst of it was, with Travers matching at what he believed
to be Bellatrix’s side, there was no means for Harry to communicate
with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of the
marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook
had already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked
528
Gringotts
the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were
clutching long thin golden rods.
“Ah, Probity Probes,” signed Travers theatrically, “so crude—
but so effective!”
And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down
his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment
and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds,
Harry pointed Draco’s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, “Confundo” twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking
through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave
a little start as the spells hit them.
Hermione’s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed
the steps.
“One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his Probe.
“But you’ve just done that!” said Hermione in Bellatrix’s commanding, arrogant voice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised.
The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe
and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice,
“Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.”
Hermione swept forward. Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook
trotting invisibly behind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed
the threshold. The wizards were both scratching their heads.
Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of
silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to
potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a
knife-sharp memory came to him: standing on this very spot on
the day that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday
of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, “Like I said,
529
Chapter 26
yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had seemed a place of
wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he
had never known he possessed, and never for an instant could he
have dreamed that he would return to steal. . . . But within seconds
they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank.
The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools
serving the first customers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers
headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin
through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of
her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron.
The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody
in particular, “Leprechaun,” and then greeted Travers, who passed
over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to him.
Hermione stepped forward.
“Madam Lestrange!” said the goblin, evidently startled. “Dear
me! How—how may I help you today?”
“I wish to enter my vault,” said Hermione.
The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around.
Not only was Travers hanging back, watching, but several other
goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.
“You have . . . identification?” asked the goblin.
“Identification? I–I have never been asked for identification
before!” said Hermione.
“They know!” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “They must
have been warned there might be an imposter!”
“Your wand will do, madam,” said the goblin. He held out a
slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry
knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix’s wand
had been stolen.
530
Gringotts
“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “the
Imperious Curse!”
Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed
it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life,
“Imperio!”
A curious sensation shot down Harry’s arm, a feeling of tingling,
warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and
veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast.
The goblin took Bellatrix’s wand, examined it closely, and then
said, “Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!”
“What?” said Hermione, “No, no, that’s mine— ”
“A new wand?” said Travers, approaching the counter again;
still the goblins all around were watching. “But how could you
have done, which wandmaker did you use?”
Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers,
he muttered, “Imperio!” once more.
“Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix’s wand,
“yes, very handsome. and is it working well? I always think wands
require a little breaking in, don’t you?”
Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry’s enormous
relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment.
The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a
younger goblin approached.
“I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who dashed
away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed
to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. “Good,
good! So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,” said the old
goblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight. “I
shall take you to your vault.”
531
Chapter 26
He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily
toward them, the contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers
was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open.
Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding
Travers with confusion.
“Wait—Bogrod!”
Another goblin came scurrying around the counter.
“We have instructions,” he said with a bow to Hermione. “Forgive me, Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the
vault of Lestrange.”
He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off.
“I am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes
to visit her vault. . . . Very old family . . . old clients . . . This way,
please . . . “
And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors
leading off the hall. Harry looked back at Travers, who was still
rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his decision. With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them,
walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed
into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flaming
torches.
“We’re in trouble; they suspect,” said Harry as the door
slammed behind them and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.
Griphook jumped down from his shoulders: neither Travers nor
Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of
Harry Potter in their midst. “They’re Imperiused,” he added, in
response to Hermione and Ron’s confused queries about Travers
and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. “I
532
Gringotts
don’t think I did it strongly enough, I don’t know . . . ”
And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an
Unforgivable Curse: “You need to mean them, Potter!”
“What do we do?” asked Ron. “Shall we get out now, while we
can?”
“If we can,” said Hermione, looking back toward the door into
the main hall, beyond which who knew what was happening.
“We’ve got this far, I say we go on,” said Harry.
“Good!” said Griphook. “So, we need Bogrod to control the
cart; I no long have the authority. But there will not be room for
the wizard.”
Harry pointed his wand at Travers.
“Imperio!”
The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart
pace.
“What are you making him do?”
“Hide,” said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who
whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the
tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could
hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered
into it, Bogrod in front of Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione
crammed together in the back.
With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurried
past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the
cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages,
sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over
the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as
they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth,
533
Chapter 26
but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous
footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, the more
foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have
brought along Bellatrix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who
had stolen it—
There were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within
Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of
them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track.
Harry heard Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking.
They zoomed through it. Water filled Harry’s eyes and mouth:
He could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart
flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the
cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione
shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as
though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor.
“C–Cushioning Charm,” Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled
her to her feet, but to Harry’s horror he saw that she was no longer
Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet
and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again.
They were realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their
own faces.
“The Thief’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to his feet
and looking back the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew
now, had been more than water. “It washes away all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are imposers in
Gringotts, they have set off defenses against us!”
Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag,
and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he
had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod
534
Gringotts
shaking his head in bewilderment: The Thief’s Downfall seemed
to have lifted his Imperius Curse.
“We need him,” said Griphook, “we cannot enter the vault without a Gringott’s goblin. And we need the clankers!”
“Imperio!” Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone
passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed
from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his
befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron
hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools.
“Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said Hermione, and
she pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego!”
They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as
it flew up the passageway.
“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Lead the way, Griphook!”
“How are we going to get out again?” Ron asked as they hurried
on foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their
wake like an old dog.
“Let’s worry about that when we have to,” said Harry. He was
trying to listen: He thought he could hear something clanking and
moving around nearby. “Griphook, how much farther?”
“Not far, Harry Potter, not far . . . “
And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry
had been prepared, but which still brought all of them to a halt.
A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them,
barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The
beast’s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground, its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs
bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven
deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked wings, folded close to its
535
Chapter 26
body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when
it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that
made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire
that sent them running back up the passageway.
“It is partially blind,” panted Griphook, “but even more savage
for that. However, we have the means to control it. It has learned
what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.”
Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a
number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a long
ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed
them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly.
“You know what to do,” Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “It will expect pain when it hears the noise. It will retreat,
and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.”
They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers,
and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that
the inside of Harry’s skull seemed to vibrate with the den. The
dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could
see it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by
vicious slashes across its face, and guess that it had been taught
to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers.
“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry,
who turned his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed,
pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted
away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling
with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange
creatures— some with long spines, other with drooping wingspotions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown. “Search,
fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had de536
Gringotts
scribed Hufflepuff’s cap to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the
other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know
what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around, however,
before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: The door had
reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged
into total darkness.
“No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!” said Griphook
as Ron gave a shout of surprise. “Light your wands, can’t you?
And hurry, we have little time!”
“Lumos!”
Harry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam fell upon
glittering jewels; he saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a
high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had
lit their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects
surrounding them.
“Harry, could this be—? Aargh!”
Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her
in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip. But as it
fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later,
with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling
in every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them.
“It burned me!” moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers.
“They have added Germino and Flagrante Curses!” said Griphook.
“Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies
are worthless— and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will
eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!”
“Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately, but even
537
Chapter 26
as he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with
his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped
on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot
metal.
“Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at Ron.
“Just look around!” said Harry. “Remember, the cup’s small
and gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two handles— otherwise
see if you can spot Ravenclaw’s symbol anywhere, the eagle— ”
They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning
cautiously on the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against
anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the
ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely
room to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so
that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry’s wandlight passed over
shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling;
higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an
object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.
“It’s there, it’s up there!”
Ron and Hermione pointed there wands at it too, so that the
little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had
belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession
of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.
“And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching
anything?” asked Ron.
“Accio Cup!” cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in
her desperation what Griphook had told them during their planning sessions.
“No use, no use!” snarled the goblin.
“Then what do we do?” said Harry, glaring at the goblin. “If
538
Gringotts
you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more
than—wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it
here!”
Hermione fumbled insider her robes, drew out a beaded bag,
rummaged for a few seconds, then removed the shining sword.
Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade
to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply.
“If I can just poke the sword through a handle—but how am I
going to get up there?”
The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any
of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted
treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry’s face and back
as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard
the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound
of clanking growing louder and louder.
They were truly trapped now: There was no way out except
through the door, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching
on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw
terror in their faces.
“Hermione,” said Harry, as the clanking grew louder, “I’ve got
to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it— ”
She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, “Levicorpus.”
Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and
replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped
space. With screams of pain, Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to
replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure, they
struggled and yelled has Harry thrust the sword through the handle
539
Chapter 26
of Hufflepuff’s cup, hooking it onto the blade.
“Impervius!” screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from the burning metal.
Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and
Hermione were waist deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod
from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out
of sight; and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in
view.
Harry seized Griphook’s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling.
“Liberatocorpus!” yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword
flew out of Harry’s hand.
“Get it!” Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his
skin, as Griphook clambered onto his shoulders again, determined
to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. “Where’s the sword?
It had the cup on it!”
The clanking on the other side of the door was growing
deafening—it was too late—
“There!”
It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged,
and in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected
them to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of
Harry’s hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of
burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it
high out of Harry’s reach. The tiny golden cup, skewered by the
handle on the sword’s blade was flung into the air. The goblin
astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he could feel
it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless
540
Gringotts
Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the
entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding
uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver
that bore him, Ron, Hermione into the outer chamber.
Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and
still borne along the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved
the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but
Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry’s shoulders the moment
he could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, “Thieves! Thieves! Help!
Thieves!” He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd,
all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without
question.
Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew
that the only way out was through.
“Stupefy!” he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets
of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over,
but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running
around the corner.
The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew
over the goblins; The wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they
had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing
his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled,
“Relashio!”
The cuffs broken open with loud bangs.
“This way!” Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at
the advancing goblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon.
“Harry—Harry—what are you doing?” cried Hermione.
“Get up, climb up, come on— ”
541
Chapter 26
The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry’s foot found
the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back.
The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He
stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed
on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that
it was untethered.
With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as
tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the
air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the
ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing
goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks.
“We’ll never get out, it’s too big!” Hermione screamed, but
the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the
tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer
force, the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry’s eyes
were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crash
of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only cling to its back,
expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, “Defodio!”
She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving
out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air, away
from the shrieking and clanking goblins: Harry and Ron copied
her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They
passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast
seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them
the passage was full of the dragon’s thrashing, spiked tail, of great
lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of
the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the
542
Gringotts
dragon’s fire kept their progress clear—
And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and
the dragon’s brute strength, they had blasted their way out of the
passage into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards shrieked and
ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings:
Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell
beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal
doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it
staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky.
543
Chapter 27
The Final Hiding Place
T
here was no means of steering; the dragon could not see
where it was going, and Harry knew that if it turned
sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible
to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, as they
climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a
gray-and-green map, Harry’s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude
for an escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the
beast’s neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool
breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon’s
wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. Behind him,
whether from delight or fear he could not tell. Ron kept swearing
at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.
After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread
that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on
nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. He had no idea how long dragons could
fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which could
544
The Final Hiding Place
barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced
around constantly, imagining that he could feel his seat prickling.
How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had
broken into the Lestranges’ vault? How soon would the goblins of
Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How quickly would they realize what
had been taken? And then, when they discovered that the golden
cup was missing? Voldemort would know, at last, that they were
hunting Horcruxes.
The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air. It climbed
steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and
Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were
cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over
countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown, over roads
and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and
glossy ribbon.
“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as they flew
farther and farther north.
“No idea,” Harry bellow back. His hands were numb with cold
but he did not date attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail
beneath them, if the dragon headed for open seal he was cold and
numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he
wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would need
sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it
had three highly edible humans sitting on its back?
The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and
still the dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath
them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant dark
cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to
545
Chapter 27
the dragon’s back.
“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch
of silence, “or are we losing height?”
Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes,
coppery in the sunset. The landscape seemed to grow larger and
more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon, and he
wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by
the flashes of reflected sunlight.
Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes.
“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called back to
the others. “Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!”
They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see
the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the
water.
“NOW!”
He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst
toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had
estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into
a freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface
and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles
from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon
did not seem to have noticed anything; it was already fifty feet
away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred
snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping,
from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating
hard, and landed at last on a distant bank.
Harry, Ron and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore.
The lake did not seem to be deep. Soon it was more a question of
546
The Final Hiding Place
fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at
last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery
grass.
Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry
could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet,
drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells
around them.
When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first
time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault.
Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their
clothing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they
dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries. Hermione
handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin
juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for
all of them. They changes and then gulped down the juice.
“Well, on the upside,” said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, “we got the Horcrux. On the
downside— ”
“—no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped
dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn
beneath.
“No sword,” repeated Ron. “That double-crossing little
scab . . . ”
Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he
had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them.
Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles
of juice.
“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird
hanging around our necks,” said Ron, wiping his mouth on the
547
Chapter 27
back of his hand.
Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the
dragon was still drinking.
“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked, “Will it be
alright?”
“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron, “It’s a dragon, Hermione,
it can look after itself. It’s us we need to worry about.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well I don’t know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I
think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.”
All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Harry’s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger,
but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed
until his throat was raw.
“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally,
hiccuping herself back to seriousness. “He’ll know, won’t he? YouKnow-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!”
“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him!” said Ron hopefully,
“Maybe they’ll cover up— ”
The sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron’s voice
were extinguished. Pain cleaved Harry’s head like a sword stroke.
He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards
faced him, and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure.
“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and cold,
but fury and fear burned inside him. The one thing that he had
dreaded—but it could not be true, he could not see how . . .
The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high
above his.
“Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “Say it again!”
548
The Final Hiding Place
“M-my Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes
wide with terror, “m-my Lord . . . we t–tried to st–stop
them . . . Im–impostors, my Lord . . . broke—broke into the—into
the Lestranges’ vault . . . ”
“Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways
of revealing impostors? Who were they?”
“It was . . . it was . . . the P–Potter b–boy and the t–two
accomplices . . . ”
“And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him, “Tell me! What did they take?”
“A . . . a s–small golden c–cup m–my Lord . . . ”
The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s.
He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible,
nobody had known. How was it possible that the boy could have
discovered his secret?
The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted
through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius
Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and
again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all
of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden
cup—
Alone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they
passed before him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality— the diary was destroyed and the cup was
stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could
he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of them? Was
Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose
549
Chapter 27
wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death
through the boy, the boy —
But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he,
Lord Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the
greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer
of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men.
How could Lord Voldemort not have known, if he, himself, most
important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated?
True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed,
but he had thought that was because he had no body to fell, being
less than ghost. . . . No, surely, the rest were safe . . . The other Horcruxes must be intact. . . .
But he must know, he must be sure . . . He paced the room,
kicking aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed, and the pictures
blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and
Hogwarts—
A modicum of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy
know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had
ever known him to be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the
connection, the killings had never been traced to him. The ring,
surely, was safe.
And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave
or penetrate its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen
was absurd. . . .
As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had
stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had plumed the deepest
secrets of that place . . .
And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no
longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection. . . .
550
The Final Hiding Place
But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of
his hiding places, he must redouble protection around each of his
Horcruxes. . . . A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he
must undertake alone . . .
Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old
unease flickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle
name. . . . Dumbledore might have made the connection with the
Gaunts. . . . Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure
of his hiding places, it was there that he would go first. . . .
The lake, surely impossible . . . though was there a slight possibility that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage.
And Hogwarts . . . but he knew the his Horcrux there was safe;
it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent
to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the
castle. . . . To tell Snape why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and
Malfoy. Didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise
it was ever to trust?
He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with
him. He would not be parted from the snake anymore . . . and he
strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue
and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow. . . .
Harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the
present. He was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun,
and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by
their worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar, his
551
Chapter 27
sudden excursion into Voldemort’s mind had not passed unnoticed.
He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he was still wet
to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before
him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun.
“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low after
Voldemort’s high screams. “He knows and he’s going to check
where the others are, and the last one,” he was already on his feet,
“is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it.”
“What?”
Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried.
“But what did you see? How do you know?”
“I saw him find out about the cup, I–I was in his head, he’s”—
Harry remembered the killings— “he’s seriously angry, and scared
too, he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check
the others are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is
safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be
seen getting in. I think he’ll check that one last, but he could still
be there within hours— ”
“Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, now scrambling to his feet too.
“No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn’t think
about exactly where it is— ”
“Wait, wait!” cried Hermione as Ron caught up to the Horcrux
and Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. “We can’t just
go, we haven’t got a plan, we need to— ”
“We need to get going,” said Harry firmly. He had been hoping
to sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was
impossible now, “Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he
realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the
552
The Final Hiding Place
Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t safe enough?”
“But how are we going to get in?”
“We’ll go to Hogsmeade,” said Harry, “and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school’s like.
Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.”
“But we don’t really fit— ”
“It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.”
The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water.
The dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused
in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now
black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a
nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward and took her
place between the other two, Harry pulled the Cloak down as far
as it would go, and together they turned on the spot into the
crushing darkness.
553
Chapter 28
The Missing Mirror
H
arry’s feet touched the road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and
the mist line of black mountains beyond the village
and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward
Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart, he remembered with piercing
accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon
landing— and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron’s and
Hermione’s arms, it happened.
The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort’s
when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every
nerve in Harry’s body, and he knew that their appearance had
caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak,
the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked
and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft.
Harry seized Ron’s wrist as he raised his wand; there were too
many of them to run. Even attempting it would have give away
554
The Missing Mirror
their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and the
scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains.
“Accio Cloak!” roared one of the Death Eaters
Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to escape. The
Summoning Charm had not worked on it.
“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the Death
Eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows. “Spread
now. He’s here.”
Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street,
and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the
darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams
of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters’ searching
wands.
“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate now!”
“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death
Eater shouted,
“We know you are here, Potter, and there’s no getting away!
We’ll find you!”
“They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set up that
spell to tell them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to
keep us here, trap us— ”
“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater.
“Let’em have free rein, they’d find him quick enough!”
“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his— ”
“’An dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s
life, not his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”
There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel
dementors they would have to produce Patronuses which would
555
Chapter 28
give them away immediately.
“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione
whispered.
Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over
the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the
stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt Hermione
take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot.
The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have
become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had
cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper
into Harry’s flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side
street, groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound.
Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten
or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness
than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed
and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry
was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking
those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair in the
air, closing in—
He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor’s Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and
Hermione that he thought as he whispered “Expecto Patronum!”
The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out
of sight
“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a
stag!”
The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again
and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but
556
The Missing Mirror
before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a
grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the
narrow street, and a rough voice said: “Potter, in here, quick!”
He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through
the open doorway.
“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a tall
figure, passing them on his way into the street and slammed the
door behind him.
Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by
the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of
the Hog’s Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a
second doorway, which led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they
climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened into a sitting room
with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a
single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room
with a kind of a vacant sweetness.
Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried toward the grimy window and looked
down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog’s
Head’s barman, was the only person not wearing a hood.
“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “So
what? You send dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus
back at’em! I’m not having’em near me, I’ve told you that. I’m
not having it!”
“That wasn’t your Patronus,” said a Death Eater. “That was
a stag. It was Potter’s!”
“Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. “Stag!
You idiot—Expecto Patronum!”
Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head
557
Chapter 28
down, it charged toward the High Street, and out of sight.
“That’s not what I saw” said the Death Eater, though was less
certainly
“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his companions told the barman. “Someone was out on the streets against
regulations— ”
“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your
curfew!”
“You set off the Caterwauling Charm?”
“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for
sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want
to! But I hope for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark
Marks, and summoned him. He’s not going to like being called
here, for me and my old cat, is he, now?”
“Don’t worry about us.” said one of the Death Eaters, “Worry
about yourself, breaking curfew!”
“And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my
pub’s closed down? What will happen to your little sidelines then?”
“Are you threatening—?”
“I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t it?”
“I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the first Death
Eater.
“Stag?” roared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!”
“All right, we made a mistake,” said the second Death Eater.
“Break curfew again and we won’t be so lenient!”
The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and
sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then
pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman
558
The Missing Mirror
down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.
Harry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece:
a small, rectangular mirror, propped on top of it, right beneath
the portrait of the girl.
The barman entered the room.
“You bloody fools,” he said gruffly, looking from one to the
other of them. “What were you thinking, coming here?”
“Thank you,” said Harry. “You can’t thank you enough. You
saved our lives!”
The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into
the face: trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair beard.
He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue.
“It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.”
There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked
at each other.
“You sent Dobby.”
The barman nodded and looked around for the elf.
“Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him?”
“He’s dead,” said Harry, “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.”
The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said,
“I’m sorry to hear it, I liked that elf.”
He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not
looking at any of them.
“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back.
He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire.
“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across to Sirius’s
mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.
“Bought it from Dung ’bout a year ago,” said Aberforth. “Al559
Chapter 28
bus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.”
Ron gasped.
“The silver doe,” he said excitedly, “Was that you too?”
“What are you talking about?” asked Aberforth.
“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!”
“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I
just proved my Patronus is a goat?”
“Oh,” said Ron, “Yeah . . . well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.
“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room,
reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese,
and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front
of the fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there
was sound of chewing.
“Right then,” said Aberforth when the had eaten their fill and
Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. “We need to
think of the best way to get you out of here. Can’t be done by
night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during
darkness: Caterwauling Charm’s set off, they’ll be onto you like
bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass of
a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew
lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot.
Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you’ll be
able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He’s been hiding in
a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.”
“We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into Hogwarts.”
“Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth.
“We’ve got to,” said Harry.
560
The Missing Mirror
“What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning forward, “is
to get as far from here as from here as you can.”
“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve got to
get into the castle. Dumbledore— I mean, your brother—wanted
us— ”
The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth’s glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the
blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog.
“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth,
“and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out
his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of
the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes.
He’s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don’t owe him
anything.”
“You don’t understand.” said Harry again.
“Oh, don’t I?” said Aberforth quietly. “You don’t think I understood my own brother? Think you know Albus better than I
did?”
“I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with
exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. “It’s . . . he left
me a job.”
“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope? Pleasant?
Easy? Sort of thing you’d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be
able to do without overstretching themselves?”
Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained.
“I—it’s not easy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got to— ”
“‘Got to’? Why ‘got to’ ? He’s dead, isn’t he?” said Aberforth
roughly. “Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!”
“I can’t.”
561
Chapter 28
“Why not?”
“I— ” Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took
the offensive instead. “But you’re fighting too, you’re in the Order
of the Phoenix— ”
“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is finished.
You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter,
he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.” He jerked a thumb at Ron and
Hermione. “They’ll be in danger long as they live now everyone
knows they’ve been working with you.”
“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job— ”
“Give it to someone else!”
“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all— ”
“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest
with you?”
Harry wanted him with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow
the simple word would not rise to his lips, Aberforth seemed to
know what he was thinking.
“I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother’s
knee. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus . . . he
was a natural.”
The old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the
mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only
picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else.
“Mr. Dumbledore” said Hermione rather timidly. “Is that your
sister? Ariana?”
“Yes.” said Aberforth tersely. “Been reading Rita Skeeter, have
562
The Missing Mirror
you, missy?”
Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione
had turned red.
“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry, trying to spare
Hermione.
“That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of
mead. “Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every office, he
did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks
of it.”
Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and
uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months
now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had
decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated
for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told
everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no
desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that would
deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth’s gaze, which was
so strikingly like his brother’s: The bright blue eyes gave the same
impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny,
and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and
despised him for it.
“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,” said
Hermione in a low voice.
“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing how many of the
people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse
state than if he’d left ’em well alone.”
“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly.
“Never you mind,” said Aberforth.
“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said Hermione. “Are
563
Chapter 28
you— are you talking about your sister?”
Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing
the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.
“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three
Muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through the
back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch
or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect.
They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn’t
show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the
little freak doing it.”
Hermione’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly
sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in
his anger and the intensity of his pain.
“It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again.
She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned
inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t
control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly
she was sweet and scared and harmless.
“And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aberforth, “and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban
for it. He never said why he’d done it, because the Ministry had
known what Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in St.
Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious threat to
the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with
magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn’t keep it
in any longer.
“We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it
about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to
keep her calm and happy.
564
The Missing Mirror
“I was her favourite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby
schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and
wrangled beard. “Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom
when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes,
keeping up with his correspondence with ‘the most notable magical
names of the day,’” Aberforth succored. “He didn’t want to be
bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when
she wouldn’t do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when
she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to
help me feed the goats.
“Then, when she was fourteen . . . See, I wasn’t there.” said
Aberforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She
had one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was,
and . . . it was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my
mother was killed.”
Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not
want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry
wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this;
whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it.
“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little
Doge. The pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and
then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of
the family. Ha!”
Aberforth spat into the fire.
“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about
school, I’d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to
finish my education and he’d take over from my mother. Bit of a
comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there’s no prizes for looking after your
half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day.
565
Chapter 28
But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.”
And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s
face.
“Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to,
someone just as bright and talented he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans
for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever
else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit
of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, what did that
matter, when Albus was working for the greater good?
“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was
nearly time for me to go hack to Hogwarts, so I told ’em, both
of ’em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,” and Aberforth looked
downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as
a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. “I told
him, you’d better give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s in no fit
state, you can’t take her with you, wherever it is you’re planning
to go, when you’re making your clever speeches, trying to whip
yourselves up a following. He didn’t like that.” said Aberforth,
and his eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses
of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. “Grindelwald
didn’t like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid
little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant
brother . . . Didn’t I understand, my poor sister wouldn’t have to
be hidden once they’d changed the world, and led the wizards out
of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place?
“And there was an argument . . . and I pulled my wand, and he
pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my
brother’s best friend— and Albus was trying to stop him, and then
566
The Missing Mirror
all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs
set her off, she couldn’t stand it— ”
The color was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had
suffered a mortal wound.
“— and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know
what she was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could
have been any of us— and she was dead.”
His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the
nearest chair. Hermione’s face was wet with tears, and Ron was
almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He
wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of
it.
“I’m so . . . I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered.
“Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.”
He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat.
“’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record
already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set
to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the
burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the— ”
“He was never free,” said Harry.
“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth.
“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, he
drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn’t there. ‘Don’t hurt them,
please . . . hurt me instead.’”
Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone
into details about what had happened on the island on the lake:
The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had
returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly.
567
Chapter 28
“He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I
know he did,” said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whispering,
pleading. “He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you
and Ariana . . . It was torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you
wouldn’t say he was free.”
Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and
veined hands. After a long pause he said. “How can you be sure,
Potter, that my brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good
than in you? How can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like
my little sister?”
A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart.
“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione.
“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then?” shot back Aberforth.
“Why didn’t he say to him, ‘Take care of yourself, here’s how to
survive’?”
“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you’ve got to think about the greater good! This is war!”
“You’re seventeen, boy!”
“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given
up!”
“Who says I’ve given up?”
“The Order of the Phoenix is finished,” Harry repeated, “YouKnow-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves.”
“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!”
“No, it isn’t.” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to finish
You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going
to keep going until I succeed— or I die. Don’t think I don’t know
568
The Missing Mirror
how this might end. I’ve known it for years.”
He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He
merely moved.
“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If you can’t
help us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find
a way in ourselves. If you can help us—well, now would be a great
time to mention it.”
Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with
the eye, that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he
cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table,
and approached the portrait of Ariana.
“You know what to do,” he said.
She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits
usually did, one of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed
to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight
figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness.
“Er—what—?” began Ron.
“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You must
know they’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both
ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols
inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has
never been so heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything
once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as
his deputies . . . well, that’s your lookout, isn’t it? You say you’re
prepared to die.”
“But what . . . ?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s picture.
A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel,
and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger
and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her
569
Chapter 28
now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking
excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen. He appeared
and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their
heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swang
forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real
tunnel was revealed. And our of it, his hair overgrown, his face
cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who
gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled.
“I knew you’d come! I knew it, Harry!”
570
Chapter 29
The Lost Diadem
N
eville—what the—how—?”
But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with
yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer
Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One
of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks
on his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he
had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with
happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, “I knew you’d
come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time!”
“Neville, what’s happened to you?”
“What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of
the head. “This is nothing, Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we
get going then? Oh,” he turned to Aberforth, “Ab, there might be
a couple more people on the way.”
“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What d’you
mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Caurwauling Charm on the whole village!”
571
Chapter 29
“I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,”
said Neville. “Just send them down the passage when they get here,
will you? Thanks a lot.”
Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her climb
up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel, Ron followed, then
Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth.
“I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our lives twice.”
“Look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth gruffly. “I might not be
able to save ’em a third time.”
Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hold
behind Ariana’s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the
outside: It looked as though the passageway had been there for
years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was
worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike,
across the wall.
“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set off. “It
isn’t on the Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were
only seven passages in and out of the school?”
“They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,” said
Neville. “There’s no chance of getting through any of them now,
not with the curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.” He started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. “Never mind that stuff. . . . Is it true? Did
you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it, Teddy Boot got beaten up
by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!”
“Yeah, it’s true,” said Harry.
Neville laughed gleefully,
572
The Lost Diadem
“What did you do with the dragon?”
“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for
keeping it as a pet— ”
“Don’t exaggerate, Ron— ”
“But what have you been doing? People have been saying
you’ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think
you’ve been up to something.”
“You’re right,” said Harry. “but tell us about Hogwarts,
Neville, we haven’t heard anything.”
“It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said
Neville, the smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know
about the Carrows?”
“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of
all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all
supposed to refer us the the Carrows if we do anything wrong.
They don’t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate
them as much as we do.”
“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against
the Dark Arts, except now it’s just Dark Arts. We’re supposed to
practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions—”
“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down
the passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed
at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some
573
Chapter 29
people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time
they’ve ever been top in anything, I expect.
“Alecto, Amycus’ sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We’ve all got to listen to her explain how
Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove
wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the
natural order is being reestablished. I got this one,” he indicated
another slash to his face, “for asking how much Muggle blood she
and her brother have got.”
“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place for
getting a smart mouth.”
“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood
it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it
gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.”
“But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said Ron, wincing
slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville’s injuries were thrown
into even greater relief.
“Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much pure blood,
so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually
kill us.”
Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville
was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them.
“The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends
and relatives on the outside are giving trouble. They get taken
hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in
The Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back
for Christmas.”
“Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen her— ”
574
The Lost Diadem
“Yeah, I know, she managed to met a message to me.”
From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized
it as one of the fake Galleons that Dumbledore’s Army had used
to send one another messages.
“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione.
“The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove
them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the
walls: Dumbledore’s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape
hated it.”
“You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past tense.
“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville. “We
lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter,
and the three of us were sort of leaders. The Carrows seemed to
know that I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on
me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing
a first-year they’d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly.
That scared people off.”
“No kidding,” muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope
upward.
“Yeah, well, I couldn’t ask people to go through what Michael
did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago.
That’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I
suppose, and they went for Gran.”
“They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.
“Yeah,” said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage
was climbing so steeply, “well, you can see their thinking. It had
worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to be575
Chapter 29
have, I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the
other way around. Thing was,” he faced them, and Harry was
astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit off a bit more
than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living along,
he the probably thought they didn’t need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,” Neville laughed, “Dawlish is still in St.
Mungo’s and Gran’s on the run. She sent me a letter” he clapped
a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, “telling me she was proud
of me, that I’m my parents’ son, and to keep it up.”
“Cool,” said Ron.
“Yeah,” said Neville happily. “Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do
without me after all. I don’t know whether they were planning to
kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to
disappear.”
“But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t— aren’t
we heading straight back into Hogwarts?”
“’Course,” said Neville. “You’ll see. We’re here.”
They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of
the passage. Another short flight of steps led to a door just like
the one hidden behind Ariana’s portrait. Neville pushed it open
and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out
to unseen people:
“Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?”
As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were
several screams and yells: “HARRY!” “It’s Potter, it’s POTTER!”
“Ron!” “Hermione!”
He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps
576
The Lost Diadem
and many faces. The next moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were
engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their
hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people:
They might just have won a Quidditch final.
“Okay, okay, calm down!” Neville called, and as the crowd
backed away, Harry was able to take in their surroundings.
He did not recognize the room at all. It was enormous, and
rather looked like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree
house, or perhaps a gigantic ship’s cabin. Multicolored hammocks
were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around
the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered
in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion,
emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against
yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and
green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the
corner, a large wooden-cased wireless.
“Where are we?”
“Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville. “Surpassed
itself, hasn’t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had
just one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door
and this is what I found! Well, it wasn’t exactly like this when I
arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and
just Gryffindor hangings, but it’s expanded as more and more of
the D.A. have arrived.”
“And the Carrows can’t get in?” asked Harry, looking around
for the door.
“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized
577
Chapter 29
until he spoke: Seamus’ face was bruised and puffy. “It’s a proper
hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can’t get at us, the
door won’t open. It’s all down to Neville. He really gets this room.
You’ve got to ask it for exactly what you need—like, “I don’t want
any Carrow supporters to be able to get in— and it’ll do it for you!
You’ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! Neville’s the
man!”
“It’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville modestly. “I’d
been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and
wishing I could get something to eat, and that’s when the passage
to Hog’s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth.
He’s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that’s
the one thing the room doesn’t really do.”
“Yea, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of
Elemental Transfiguration,” said Ron to general astonishment.
“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said
Seamus, “and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls
started turning up— ”
“— and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now
that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces.
Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan,
Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner.
“Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie. “There’ve
been so many rumors, we’ve been trying to keep up with you on
Potterwatch,” He pointed at the wireless. “You didn’t break into
Gringotts?”
“They did!” said Neville. “And the dragon’s true too!”
578
The Lost Diadem
There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron
took a bow.
“What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly.
Before any of them could parry the question with one of their
own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As
he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the
Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside some
shack, an the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a
disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and
Voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside his head.
With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s mind
again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up.
“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want to sit
down? I expect you’re tired, aren’t—?”
“No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to
tell them without words that Voldemort has just discovered the
loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast:
If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their
chance.
“We need to get going,” he said, and their expression told him
that they understood.
“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked Seamus.
“What’s the plan?”
“Plan?” repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower
to prevent himself succumbing again to Voldemort’s rage: His scar
was still burning. “Well, there’s something we—Ron, Hermione,
and I—need to do, and then we’ll get out of here.”
579
Chapter 29
Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked
confused.
“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?”
“We haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry, rubbing his scar,
trying to soothe the pain. “There’s something important we need
to do— ”
“What is it?”
“I— I can’t tell you.”
There was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville’s brows contracted.
“Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with fighting
You-Know-Who, right?”
“Well, yeah— ”
“Then we’ll help you.”
The other members of Dumbledore’s Army were nodding, some
enthusiastically, other solemnly. A couple of them rose from their
chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action.
“You don’t understand,” Harry seemed to have said that a lot
in the last few hours. “We—we can’t tell you. We’ve got to do
it— alone.”
“Why?” asked Neville.
“Because . . . ” In his desperation to start looking for the missing
Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and
Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry
found it difficult to gather his thoughts; His scar was still searing.
“Dumbledore left the three of us a job,” he said carefully, “and we
weren’t supposed to tell— I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the
three of us.”
580
The Lost Diadem
“We’re his army,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army. We were
all in it together, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have
been off on your own— ”
“It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron.
“I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t trust us.
Everyone in this room’s been fighting and they’ve been driven in
here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in
here’s proven they’re loyal to Dumbledore—loyal to you.”
“Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was going to
say, but it did not matter: the tunnel door had just opened behind
him.
“We got your message, Neville! Hello, you three, I thought you
must be here!”
It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and
ran to hug his best friend.
“Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be back!”
“Luna,” said Harry distractingly, “what are you doing here?
How did you—?”
“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. “I
promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know.
We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution.
That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.”
“Of course that’s what it means,” said Luna brightly, “Isn’t it,
Harry? We’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?”
“Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m sorry,
but that’s not what we came back for. There’s something we’ve
got to do, and then— ”
“You’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded Michael
581
Chapter 29
Corner.
“No!” said Ron. “What we’re doing will benefit everyone in
the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who— ”
“Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be a part
of it!”
There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His
head seemed to fall: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in
the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny
gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, he had never fully
appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less
please to see her.
“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand
in answer to several cries of greeting. “He wants a kip, and his
bar’s turned into a railway station.”
Harry’s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry’s
old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him.
“I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake Galleon,
and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner.
“So what’s the plan, Harry?” said George.
“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden
appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while
his scar was still burning so fiercely.
“Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite
kind,” said Fred.
“You’ve got to stop this!” Harry told Neville. “What did you
call them all back for? This is insane— ”
“We’re fighting aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his fake
Galleon. “The message said Harry was back, and we were going to
582
The Lost Diadem
fight! I’ll have to get a wand, though— ”
“You haven’t got a wand —?” began Seamus.
Ron turned suddenly to Harry.
“Why can’t they help?”
“What?”
“They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so that none
of them could hear but Hermione, who stood between then, “We
don’t know where it is, We’ve got to find it fast. We don’t have to
tell them it’s a Horcrux.”
Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, “I think
Ron’s right. We don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need
them.” And when Harry looked unconvinced, “You don’t have to
do everything alone, Harry.”
Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening
to split again. Dumbledore had warned against telling anyone but
Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that’s
how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was a natural . . . Was he turning
into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid
to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that
led? To murder at the top of the highest tower . . .
“All right,” he said quietly to the other two. “Okay,” he called
to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who
had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent,
and all of them looked alert, excited.
“There’s something we need to find,” Harry said. “Something—
something that’ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It’s here at
Hogwarts, but we don’t know where. It might have belonged to
Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone
583
Chapter 29
ever come across something with her eagle on it, for instance?”
He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to
Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered,
perched on the arm of Ginny’s chair.
“Well, that’s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember,
Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy’s trying to duplicate it.”
“Yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael Corner, rolling his
eyes, “is lost, Luna. That’s sort of the point.”
“When was it lost?” asked Harry.
“Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart sank.
“Professor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,” she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws, “nobody’s ever found a trace of it, have they?”
They all shook their heads.
“Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron.
“It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s was
supposed to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the
wearer.”
“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons— ”
But Harry cut across Luna.
“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?”
They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An
object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace,
did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the
castle. . . . Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho
spoke again.
584
The Lost Diadem
“If you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to look like,
I could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry.
Ravenclaw’s wearing it in her statue.”
Harry’s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth
soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around
his shoulders. Voldemort was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he did not know; Either way,
there was hardly any time left.
“He’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ron ad Hermione. He
glanced at Cho and then back at them. “Listen, I know it’s not
much of a lead, but I’m going to go and look at this statue, at least
find out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep,
you know— the other one— safe,”
Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, “No,
Luna will take Harry, won’t you, Luna?”
“Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho sat down
again, looking disappointed.
“How do we get out?” Harry asked Neville.
“Over here.”
He lead Harry and Luna into a corner, where a small cupboard
opened onto a staircase.
“It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never
been able to find it,” he said. “Only trouble is, we never know
exactly where we’re going to end up when we go out. Be careful,
Harry, they’re always patrolling the corridors at night.”
“No problem.” said Harry. “See you in a bit.”
He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by
585
Chapter 29
torches, and turned corners in unexpected places. At last they
reached what appeared to be solid wall.
“Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility
Cloak and throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little
push.
It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry
glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They
were standing in a dark corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into
the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out
the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his nose he search, and
located his and Luna’s dots at last.
“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch moving away from them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.”
They crept off.
Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but
never has his heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended oh his safe passage through the place. Through squares
of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets
creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond
which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking
the Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to
allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He
expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear
was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the
first, telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach.
“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and
pulling him toward a spiral staircase.
They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been
586
The Lost Diadem
up here before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle
and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a
bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle.
Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in
midair, unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in
the silence, it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the
beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird’s call, a soft musical
voice said, “Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?”
“Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking
thoughtful.
“What? Isn’t there just a password?”
“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna.
“What if you get it wrong?”
“Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said
Luna. “That way you learn, you see?”
“Yeah . . . Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for anyone
else, Luna.”
“No, I see what you mean,” said Luna seriously. “Well then, I
think the answer is that a circle has no beginning.”
“Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung open.
The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular
room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful
etched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blueand-bronze silks; By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular
view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and
painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet.
There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite
the door stood a tall statue of white marble.
587
Chapter 29
Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen
at Luna’s house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he
guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble
woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half
smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicatelooking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head.
It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There
were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the
Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them.
“‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’”
“Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a cackling voice.
Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the
floor. The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing
before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby
forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm.
588
Chapter 30
The Sacking of Severus
Snape
T
he moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry’s scar
burned savagely, the starry room vanished from sight,
and he was standing upon an overcrop of rock beneath
a cliff, and the sea was washing around him and there
was triumph in his heart—They have the boy.
A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented,
he raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling
forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases
tinkled.
“I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,” said
Luna, sounding mildly interested. “That was noisier than I thought
it would be.”
And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying,
echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading
to the dormitories: Luna’s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping
above.
589
Chapter 30
“Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!”
Luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and
she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a
stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the
common room. There were gasps and cries o surprise as they say
Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled in around her,
a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them.
Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her
backside with his big toe.
“I think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight.
“Oh, look,” whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws
crowded in around Alecto. “They’re pleased!”
“Yeah . . . great . . . ”
Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink
again into Voldemort’s mind. . . . He was moving along the tunnel
into the first cave. . . . He had chosen to make sure of the locket
before coming . . . but that would not take him long. . . .
There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw
froze. From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that
issued from the eagle door knocker: “Where do Vanished objects
go?”
“I dunno, do I? Shut it!” snarled an uncouth voice that Harry
knew was that of the Carrow brother, Amycus. “Alecto? Alecto?
Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!”
The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then, without warning, there came a series of loud bangs,
as though somebody was firing a gun into the door.
“ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven’t got Potter—d’you
want to go the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!” Amycus
bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did not
590
The Sacking of Severus Snape
open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most
frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds.
Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast
the door open and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do
anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the
door.
“May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?”
“Trying— to get— through this damned—door!” shouted
Amycus. “Go and get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!”
“But isn’t your sister in there?” asked Professor McGonagall.
“Didn’t Professor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at you
urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then
you needn’t wake up half the castle.”
“She ain’t answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do
it, now!”
“Certainly, if you wish it,” said Professor McGonagall, with
awful coldness. There was a gentle tap of the knocker and the
musical voice asked again.
“Where do Vanished objects go?”
“Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything.” replied Professor
McGonagall.
“Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and the door
swung open.
The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the
stairs as Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand.
Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes,
which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He
let out a yell of fury and fear.
“What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed. “I’ll
Cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it— and what’s
591
Chapter 30
the Dark Lord going to say?” he shrieked, standing over his sister
and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist, “We haven’t
got him, and they’ve gone and killed her!”
“She’s only Stunned,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently,
who had stooped down to examine Alecto. “She’ll be perfectly all
right.”
“No she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed Amycus. “Not after
the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She’s gone and sent for him, I felt
me Mark burn, and he thinks we’ve got Potter!”
“Got Potter?” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “What do
you mean, ‘got Potter’?”
“He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower,
and to send for him if we caught him!”
“Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower?
Potter belongs in my House!”
Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of
pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed
up inside him.
“We was told he might come in here!” said Carrow. “I dunno
why, do I?”
Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the
room. Twice they passed right over the place where Harry and
Luna stood.
“We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his piglike face
suddenly crafty. “Yeah, that’s what we’ll do. We’ll say Alecto was
ambushed by the kids, them kids up there”—he looked up at the
starry ceiling toward the dormitories— “and we’ll say they forced
her to press the Mark, and that’s why he got a false alarm. . . . He
can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what’s the difference?”
592
The Sacking of Severus Snape
“Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,” said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, “a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate.
But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass
off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not
permit it.”
“Excuse me?”
Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back
away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting
she had found stuck to a lavatory seat.
“It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva McGonagall.
You time’s over. It’s us what’s in charge here now, and you’ll back
me up or you’ll pay the price.”
And he spat in her face.
Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said,
“You shouldn’t have done that.”
As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!”
The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the
air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then,
with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front
of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor.
“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering
through his brain, “you need to really mean it.”
“Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart.
“Potter—you’re here! What—? How—?” She struggled to pull
herself together. “Potter, that was foolish!”
“He spat at you,” said Harry.
“Potter, I— that was very—very gallant of you—but don’t you
realize—?”
593
Chapter 30
“Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied
him. “Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way.”
“Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an
air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This appearance
of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall,
who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at
the neck of her old tartan dressing gown.
“I don’t think it makes any difference what we call him,” Harry
told Luna. “He already knows where I am.”
In a distant part of Harry’s brain, that part connected to the
angry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the
dark lake in the ghostly green boat. . . . He had nearly reached the
island where the stone basin stood. . . .
“You must flee,” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Now, Potter, as quickly as you can!”
“I can’t,” said Harry. “There’s something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”
“The d–diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not—hasn’t it been
lost for centuries?” She sat up a little straighter. “Potter, it was
madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle— ”
“I had to,” said Harry. “Professor, there’s something hidden
here that I’m supposed to find, and it could be the diadem—if I
could just speak to Professor Flitwick— ”
There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: Amycus was
coming around. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointing her want at the groggy Death Eater,
and said, “Imperio.”
Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand,
then shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it
over along with his own. Then he lay down on the floor beside
594
The Sacking of Severus Snape
Alecto. Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length
of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked
around the Carrows, binding them tightly together.
“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again
with superb indifference to the Carrows’ predicament. “if He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named does indeed know that you are here— ”
As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed
through Harry, setting his scar on fire, and for a second he looked
down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that
no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface—
“Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry came back.
He was clutching Luna’s shoulder to steady himself.
“Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. Professor, I’m
acting on Dumbledore’s orders, I must find what he wanted me to
find! But we’ve got to get the students out while I’m searching the
castle— It’s me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing
a few more or less, not now—’” not now he knows I’m attacking
Horcruxes. Harry finished the sentence in his head.
“You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated with a
look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest
height.
“We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed while you search for this— this object.”
“Is that possible?”
“I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we teachers are
rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold
him off for a while if we all put out best efforts into it. Of course,
something will have to be done about Professor Snape— ”
“Let me— ”
“— and if Hogwarts is about to enter a stage of siege, with the
595
Chapter 30
Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as
many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo
network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the
grounds— ”
“There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained about
the passageway leading into the Hog’s Head.
“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students— ”
“I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are
concentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in
anyone who’s Disapparating out of Hog’s Head.”
“There’s something in that,” she agreed. She pointed her wand
at the Carrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies,
tied itself around them, and hoisted them into the air, where they
dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea
creatures. “Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You’d
better put that Cloak back on.”
She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her
wand. From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings
around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the
spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry,
and Luna hurried back down.
Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses
left them; Professor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled
over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the
Cloak.
They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet
footsteps joined theirs, Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard
them first. He felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s
Map, but before he could take it out, McGonagall too seemed to
become aware of their company, She halted, raised her wand ready
596
The Sacking of Severus Snape
to duel, and said, “Who’s there?”
“It is I,” said a low voice.
From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.
Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had forgotten
the details of Snape’s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes,
forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his
thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not
wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and
he too was holding his wand ready for a fight.
“Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly.
“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall.
Snape stopped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor
McGonagall into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry
was there. Harry held up his wand tip too, ready to attack.
“I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto had
apprehended an intruder.”
“Really?” said Professor McGonagall. “And what gave you
that impression?”
Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where
the Dark Mark was branded into his skin.
“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You Death
Eaters have you own private means of communication, I forgot.”
Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still
probing the air all about her, and he was moving gradually closer,
with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing.
“I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors,
Minerva.”
“You have some objection?”
597
Chapter 30
“I wonder what could have brought you out of you bed at this
hour?”
“I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor McGonagall.
“Really? But all seems calm.”
Snape looked into her eyes.
“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I
must insist— ”
Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed: Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but
the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was
thrown off balance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the
wall and it flew out of its bracket. Harry, about to curse Snape,
was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames,
which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a
lasso at Snape—
Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that
McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in
seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers. Snape avoided
them only be forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with
echoing clang, the dagger sank, one after another, into the breast—
“Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still
shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professor Flitwick and
Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in the nightclothes,
with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.
“No!” squeaking Flitwick, raising his wand. “You’ll do more
murder at Hogwarts!”
Flitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snap had
taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free
of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers;
598
The Sacking of Severus Snape
Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into
the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in
full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after
him. He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he
heard McGonagall cry, “Coward! COWARD!”
“What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna.
Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted
classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were
standing at a smashed window.
“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna
ran into the room.
“You means he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring
Flitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at his sudden appearance.
“No, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand . . . and he seems to have
learned a few tricks from his master.”
With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike
shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.
There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of
puffing: Slughorn had just caught up.
“Harry!” he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath
his emerald-green silk pajamas. “My dear boy . . . what a
surprise . . . Minerva, do please explain. . . . Severus . . . what . . . ?”
“Our headmaster is taking a short break,” said Professor
McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the windows.
“Professor!” Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. He could
see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly
green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt
from it with murder in his heart—
599
Chapter 30
“Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s coming now!”
“Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,” she told
the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a
low groan. “Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s
orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are
capable while Potter does what he needs to do.”
“You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep
out You-Know-Who indefinitely?” said Professor Sprout.
“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding.
“I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then
gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be
evacuated, though if any of those who are over age wish to stay
and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.”
“Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the
door. “I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with
my House.”
And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering,
“Tentacula, Devil’s Snare. And Snargaluff pod . . . yes, I’d like to
see the Death Eaters fighting those.”
“I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he could bare
see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and
started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a
weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power
of the wind into the grounds.
“Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms master,
“Professor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you
got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”
“—Protego Horribilis — the diadem of Ravenclaw?” squeaked
Flitwick. “A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I
600
The Sacking of Severus Snape
hardly think it would be much use in this situation!”
“I only meant—do you know where it is? Have you seen it?”
“Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost,
my boy!”
Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic.
What, then, was the Horcrux?
“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall,
Filius!” said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna
to follow her.
They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into
speech.
“My word,” he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache
aquiver. “What a to-do! I’m not at all sure whether this is wise,
Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who
has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril— ”
“I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great hall in twenty
minutes, also,” said Professor McGonagall. “If you wish to leave
with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt
to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this
castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.”
“Minerva!” he said, aghast.
“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its
loyalties,” interrupted Professor McGonagall. “Go and wake your
students, Horace.”
Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and Luna
ran after Professor McGonagall, who had taken up a position in
the middle of the corridor and raised her wand.
“Piertotum — oh, for heaven’s sake, Filch, not now — ”
The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting,
“Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!”
601
Chapter 30
“They’re supposed to be here, you blithering idiot!” shouted
McGonagall. “Now go and do something constructive! Find
Peeves!”
“P–Peeves?” stammered Filch as though he had never heard
the name before.
“Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven’t you been complaining
about him for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once!”
Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave
of her senses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath.
“And now—Piertotum Locomotor!” cried Professor McGonagall.
And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped
down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the
floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout
the castle had done the same.
“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor McGonagall.
“Man the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!”
Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded
past Harry, some of them smaller, others larger, than life. There
were animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished
swords and spiked balls on chains.
“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had
better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall— I
shall rouse the other Gryffindors.”
They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna
turning back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing
traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the
Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
602
The Sacking of Severus Snape
“That was Potter!”
“Harry Potter!”
“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”
But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the
enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna
sped back down the steep staircase.
“Wh—?”
As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs
in shock. It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last
been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were
Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet,
Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the
foot of the stairs.
“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school—
Snape’s run for it—What are you doing here? How did you know?”
“We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army,” Fred
explained. “You couldn’t expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry,
and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of
snowballed.”
“What first, Harry?” called George. “What’s going on?”
“They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting
in the Great Hall to get organized,” Harry said. “We’re fighting.”
There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs,
he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army,
and Harry’s old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.
“Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding out his
603
Chapter 30
free hand; she took it and followed him back up the stairs.
The crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people remained
below in the Room of Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs.
Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them stood Lupin,
Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur.
“You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as
Harry approached. “I won’t permit it! They boys, yes, but you,
you’ve got to get home!”
“I won’t!”
Ginny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother’s grip.
“I’m in Dumbledore’s Army— ”
“A teenagers’ gang!”
“A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which no one
else has dared to do!” said Fred.
“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “She’s not old enough!
What you two were thinking, bringing her with you— ”
Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves.
“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do this.
Everyone underage will have to leave, it’s only right.”
“I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her
eyes. “My whole family’s here, I can’t stand waiting there alone
and not knowing and— ”
Her eyes met Harry’s for the first time. She looked at him
beseechingly, but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly,
“Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to
the Hog’s Head. “I’ll say good-bye now, then, and— ”
There was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone else had
clambered out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He
pulled himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through
lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, “Am I too late? Has it
604
The Sacking of Severus Snape
started? I only just found out, so I–I— ”
Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected
to run into most of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a
wildly transparent attempt to break the tension, “So—’ow eez leetle Teddy?”
Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the
Weasleys seemed to by solidifying, like ice.
“I— oh yes—he’s fine!” Lupin said loudly. “Yes, Tonks is with
him— at her mother’s— ”
Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another,
frozen.
“Here, I’ve got a picture!” Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph
from inside his jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw
a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at
the camera.
“I was a fool!” Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly
dropped his photograph. “I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I
was a— a— ”
“Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron.”
said Fred.
Percy swallowed.
“Yes, I was!”
“Well, you can’t say fairer that that,” said Fred, holding out
his hand to Percy.
Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred
aside, and pulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her
on the back, his eyes on his father.
“I’m sorry, Dad.” Percy said.
Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug
605
Chapter 30
his son.
“What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George.
“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes
under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak. “But I had
to find a way out and it’s not so easy at the Ministry, they’re
imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with
Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was
going to make a fight for it, so here I am.”
“Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as
these,” said George in a good imitation of Percy’s most pompous
manner. “Now let’s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death
Eaters’ll be taken.”
“So, you’re my sister-in-law now?” said Percy, shaking hands
with Fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with Bill, Fred,
and George.
“Ginny!” barked Mrs. Weasley.
Ginny has been attempting, under cover of the reconciliation,
to sneak upstairs too.
“Molly, how about this,” said Lupin. “Why doesn’t Ginny stay
here, then at least she’ll be on the scene and know what’s going
on, but she won’t be in the middle of the fighting?”
“I— ”
“That’s a good idea,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “Ginny, you
stay in this room, you hear me?”
Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father’s
unusually stern gaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and
Lupin headed off for the stairs as well.
“Where’s Ron?” asked Harry. “Where’s Hermione?”
“They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,” Mr.
Weasley called over his shoulder.
606
The Sacking of Severus Snape
“I didn’t see them pass me,” said Harry.
“They said something about a bathroom,” said Ginny, “not
long after you left.”
“A bathroom?”
Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the
Room of Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was
empty.
“You’re sure that they said bath—?”
But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished: He was looking through the high wrought-iron gates with
winded boars on pillars at either side, looking through the dark
grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini
lay draped over his shoulders. He was possessed of that cold, cruel
sense of purpose that preceded murder.
607
Chapter 31
The Battle of Hogwarts
T
he enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and
scattered with stars, and below it the four long House
tables were lined with disheveled students, some in
traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and
there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall,
who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall.
Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino
centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix
who had arrived to fight.
“—evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madam Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House
and take your charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation
point.”
Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry
skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and
shouted. “And what if we want to stay and fight?”
608
The Battle of Hogwarts
There was a smattering of applause.
“If you are of age, you may stay,” said Professor McGonagall.
“What about our things?” called a girl at the Ravenclaw table.
“Our trunks, our owls?”
“We have no time to collect possessions,” said Professor McGonagall. “The important thing is to get you out of here safely.”
“Where’s Professor Snape?” shouted a girl from the Slytherin
table.
“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors,
Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws.
Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still
looking for Ron and Hermione. As he paused, faces turned in his
direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake.
“We have already placed protection around the castle,” Professor McGonagall was saying, “but it is unlikely to hold for very long
unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly
and calmly, and do as your prefects— ”
But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed
throughout the Hall. It was high, cold, and clean. There was
no telling from where it came; it seemed to issue from the walls
themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might
have lain dormant there for centuries.
“I know you are preparing to fight.” There were screams
amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. “Your efforts are
futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great
respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical
blood.”
609
Chapter 31
There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that
presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained
by walls.
“Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and none
shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school
untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you should be rewarded.
“You have until midnight.”
The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every
eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen
in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose
from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as
she raised a shaking arm and screamed, “But he’s there! Potter’s
there! Someone grab him!”
Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The
Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry,
but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the
same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them, with their backs to
Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled
from beneath cloaks and under sleeves.
“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a
clipped voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the
rest of your House could follow.”
Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the
Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall.
“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall.
Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained
seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed
610
The Battle of Hogwarts
behind, and half of remained in their seats, necessitating Professor
McGonagall’s descent from the teachers’ platform to chivvy the
underage on their way.
“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!”
Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the
Gryffindor table.
“Where are Ron and Hermione?”
“Haven’t you found—?” began Mr. Weasley, looking worried.
But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised
platform to address those who had remained behind.
“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to
act fast! A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers
of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick,
Sprout, and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters
up to the three highest towers—Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and
Gryffindor—where they’ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile Remus”—he indicated Lupin— “Arthur”—he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting
at the Gryffindor table— “and I will take groups into the grounds.
We’ll need somebody to organize defense of the entrances of the
passageways into the school— ”
“Sounds like a job for us,” called Fred, indicating himself and
George, and Kingsley nodded his approval.
“All right, leaders up here and we’ll divide up the troops!”
“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as
students flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, “Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?”
“What? Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!”
He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten
611
Chapter 31
that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it: The
inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven
every other thought from his mind.
“Then go, Potter, go!”
“Right—yeah— ”
He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall
again, into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with
them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear
and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm
himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts
buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a
glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem
to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway
along an empty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a
departed statue and pulled the Marauder’s Map out of the pouch
around his neck. He could not see Ron’s or Hermione’s names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its
way to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing
them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over his face, and
closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. . . .
Voldemort thought I’d go to Ravenclaw Tower.
There it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there
could only be one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that house.
But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw
was the lost diadem . . . and how could the Horcrux be the diadem?
How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the
612
The Battle of Hogwarts
diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could
have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in
living memory?
In living memory. . . .
Beneath his fingers, Harry’s eyes flew open again. He leapt up
from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit
of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching
towards the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he
returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions,
trying to keep track of the students in their own Houses; there was
much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling
over first years to get to the front of the queue; here and there
younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately
for friends or siblings. . . .
Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the
entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.
“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!”
He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally
reaching the bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick,
ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”
Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s
felt as though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw
Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you
require—?”
“It’s got to be her—d’you know where she is?”
613
Chapter 31
“Let’s see. . . .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and
thither, peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long
hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing
finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at
her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor
into which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the
passage, still gliding smoothly away from him.
“Hey—wait—come back!”
She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground.
Harry supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair
and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud.
Close to, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times
in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken.
“You’re the Gray Lady?”
She nodded but did not speak.
“The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
“That is correct.”
Her tone was not encouraging.
“Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can
tell me about the lost diadem.”
A cold smile curved her lips.
“I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave, “that I cannot help
you.”
“WAIT!”
He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threat614
The Battle of Hogwarts
ening to overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered
in front of him. It was a quarter to midnight.
“This is urgent,” he said fiercely. “If that diadem’s at Hogwarts,
I’ve got to find it, fast.”
“You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,” she said
disdainfully. “Generations of students have badgered me— ”
“This isn’t about trying to get better marks!” Harry shouted
at her. “It’s about Voldemort—defeating Voldemort— or aren’t
you interested in that?”
She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more
opaque, and her voice was heated as she replied, “Of course I—how
dare you suggest—?”
“Well, help me, then!”
Her composure was slipping.
“It—it is not a question of— ” she stammered. “My mother’s
diadem— ”
“Your mother’s?”
She looked angry with herself.
“When I lived,” she said stiffly, “I was Helena Ravenclaw.”
“You’re her daughter? But then, you must know what happened to it!”
“While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together, “I doubt that it would greatly
increase your chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself
Lord— ”
“Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it!”
Harry said fiercely. “There’s no time to explain—but if you care
about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you’ve got
to tell me anything you know about the diadem!”
615
Chapter 31
She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at
him, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she
had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore,
who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his
head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice.
“I stole the diadem from my mother.”
“You—you did what?”
“I stole the diadem,” repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a in a whisper. “I sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my
mother. I ran away with it.”
He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence
and did not ask; he simply listened, hard, as she went on.
“My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was
gone, but pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss,
my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts.
“Then my mother fell ill-fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she
was desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had
long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She
knew that he would not rest until he had done so.”
Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.
“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused
to return with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a
hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom,
he stabbed me.”
“The Baron? You mean—?”
“The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she lifted
aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white
chest. “When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with
remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used
616
The Battle of Hogwarts
it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as
an act of penitence . . . as he should,” she added bitterly.
“And . . . and the diadem?”
“It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron
blundering through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.”
“A hollow tree?” repeated Harry. “What tree? Where was
this?”
“A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond
my mother’s reach.”
“Albania,” repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously
from confusion, and now he understood why she was telling him
what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. “You’ve already
told someone this story, haven’t you? Another student?”
She closed her eyes and nodded.
“I had . . . no idea. . . . He was . . . flattering. He seemed to . . . to
understand . . . to sympathize. . . .”
Yes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to
which she had little right.
“Well, you weren’t the first person Riddle wormed things out
of,” Harry muttered. “He could be charming when he wanted. . . .”
So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost
diadem out of the Gray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung
forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as
soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin
and Burkes.
And wouldn’t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an
excellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place
617
Chapter 31
to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years?
But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not
been left in that lowly tree. . . . No, the diadem had been returned
secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there—
“— the night he asked for a job!” said Harry, finishing his
thought.
“I beg your pardon?”
“He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!” said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled
him to make sense of it all. “He must’ve hidden the diadem on
his way up to, or down from, Dumbledore’s office! But it was still
worth trying to get the job— then he might’ve got the chance to
nick Gryffindor’s sword as well . . . thank you, thanks!”
Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As
he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his
watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew
what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where
it was.
Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he
had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As
he leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and
hit the opposite wall. Something large and furry detached itself,
whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at Harry.
“Hagrid!” Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound’s
attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet.
“What the—?”
“Harry, yer here! Yer here!”
Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib618
The Battle of Hogwarts
cracking hug, then ran back to the shattered window.
“Good boy, Grawpy!” he bellowed through the hole in the
window. “I’ll see yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!”
Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light
in the distance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down
at his watch. It was midnight. The battle had begun.
“Blimey, Harry,” panted Hagrid, “this is it, eh? Time ter fight?”
“Hagrid, where have you come from?”
“Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,” said Hagrid
grimly. “Voice carried, didn’ it? ‘Yeh got till midnight ter gimme
Potter.’ Knew yeh mus’ be here, knew what mus’ be happenin’.
Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an’ Grawpy an’ Fang.
Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was
carryin’ us, Fang an’ me. Told him ter let me down at the castle,
so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exac’ly what
I meant, bu’—where’s Ron an’ Hermione?”
“That,” said Harry, “is a really good question. Come on.”
They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them. Harry could hear movement through the corridors all
around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could
see more flashes of light in the dark grounds.
“Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry’s
heels, making the floorboards quake.
“I dunno exactly,” said Harry, making another random turn,
“but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . .”
The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the
passage ahead: The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the
entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that
had sailed through another broken window. Their remains stirred
619
Chapter 31
feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied
heads, it moaned faintly. “Oh, don’t mind me . . . I’ll just lie here
and crumble. . . .”
Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble
bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius’s house, wearing that
mad headdress— and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with
the stone diadem upon her white curls. . . .
And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a
third stone effigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock,
onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old
tiara. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky,
and he nearly stumbled.
He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . .
Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might
have been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had
penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course,
Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot
in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten
track in his time at school—here at last was a secret he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered—
He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past
followed by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing
earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.
“Mandrakes!” Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as
he ran. “Going to lob them over the walls— they won’t like this!”
Harry knew now where to go. He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang
galloping behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the
painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs
and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each
620
The Battle of Hogwarts
others’ canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As
they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook, and
Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive
force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than
those of the teachers and the Order.
“It’s all righ’, Fang—it’s all righ’!” yelled Hagrid, but the great
boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel
through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog,
leaving Harry alone.
He forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the
ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight,
Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clanking
along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony
cantering behind him.
“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out,
Harry Potter, see them off!”
Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot
of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing
beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret
passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at
the concealed hole.
“Nice night for it!” Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and
Harry sprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet
another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere,
and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws,
no doubt to return them to their proper place. . . .
“Potter!”
Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his
wand held ready.
621
Chapter 31
“I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter.”
“I know, we’re evacuating,” Harry said, “Voldemort’s— ”
“— attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said
Aberforth. “I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And
it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage?
There are kids of Death Eaters you’ve just sent to safety. Wouldn’t
it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here?”
“It wouldn’t stop Voldemort,” said Harry, “and your brother
would never have done it.”
Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction.
Your brother would never have done it. . . . Well, it was the
truth, Harry thought as he ran on again: Dumbledore, who had
defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom. . . .
And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of
mingled relief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione, both with
their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with a
broomstick under his arm.
“Where the hell have you been?” Harry shouted.
“Chamber of Secrets,” said Ron.
“Chamber—what?” said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt
before them.
“It was Ron, all Ron’s idea!” said Hermione breathlessly.
“Wasn’t it absolutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and
I said to Ron, even if we had the other one, how are we going to
get rid of it? We still hadn’t gotten rid of the cup! And then he
thought of it! The basilisk!”
“What the—?”
“Something to get rid of Horcruxes,” said Ron simply.
622
The Battle of Hogwarts
Harry’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione’s arms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the
skull of a dead basilisk.
“But how did you get in there?” he asked, staring from the
fangs to Ron. “You need to speak Parseltongue!”
Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise.
“It’s what you did to open the locket,” he told Harry apologetically. “I had to have a few goes to get it right, but,” he shrugged
modestly, “we got there in the end.”
“He was amazing!” said Hermione, “Amazing!”
“So . . . ” Harry was struggling to keep up. “So . . . ”
“So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from under
his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff’s cup. “Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn’t had the pleasure
yet.”
“Genius!” yelled Harry.
“It was nothing,” said Ron, though he looked delighted with
himself. “So what’s new with you?”
As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three
of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a
distant scream.
“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,”
said Harry, talking fast. “He hid it exactly where I hid my old
Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He
thought he was the only one to find it. Come one.”
“As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through
the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of
Requirement. It was empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks,
and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry rec623
Chapter 31
ognized immediately as Neville’s grandmother.
“Ah, Potter,” she said crisply as if she had been waiting for
him. “You can tell us what’s going on.”
“Is everyone okay?” said Ginny and Tonks together.
“’S far as we know,” said Harry. “Are there still people in the
passage to the Hog’s Head?”
He knew that the room would not be able to transform while
there were still users inside it.
“I was the last to come through,” said Mrs. Longbottom. “I
sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left
his pub. Have you seen my grandson?”
“He’s fighting,” said Harry.
“Naturally,” said the old lady proudly. “Excuse me, I must go
and assist him.”
With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps.
Harry looked at Tonks.
“I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your
mother’s?”
“I couldn’t stand not knowing— ” Tonks looked anguished.
“She’ll look after him—have you seen Remus?”
“He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds— ”
Without another word, Tonks sped off.
“Ginny,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too.
Just for a bit. Then you can come back in.”
Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.
“And then you can come back in!” he shouted after her as she
ran up the steps after Tonks. “You’ve got to come back in!”
“Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply. “We’ve forgotten
someone!”
624
The Battle of Hogwarts
“Who?” asked Hermione.
“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t
they?”
“You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry.
“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them to get
out. We don’t want anymore Dobbies, do we? We can’t order them
to die for us— “
There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione’s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck
and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and
broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm
that he lifted Hermione off her feet.
“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing
happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still
more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “Oi!
There’s a war going on here!”
Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each
other.
“I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had recently
been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, “so it’s now or
never, isn’t it?”
“Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” Harry shouted.
“D’you think you could just— just hold it in until we’ve got the
diadem?”
“Yeah— right— sorry— ” said Ron, and he and Hermione set
about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.
It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor
upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room
of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated
625
Chapter 31
severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust
filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of
green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew
the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking
down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what
looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his
displeasure.
“Let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said Ron as more
screams echoed from close by.
“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry turned
and saw Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next
window, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched,
Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below.
“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward
them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he
led a small group of students past. “They look like they might be
breaching the north battlements, they’ve brought giants of their
own.”
“Have you seen Remus?” Tonks called after him.
“He was dueling Dolohov,” shouted Aberforth, “haven’t seen
him since!”
“Tonks,” said Ginny, “Tonks, I’m sure he’s okay— “
But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth.
Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
“They’ll be all right,” said Harry, though he knew they were
empty words. “Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out
of the way, keep safe—come on!” he said to Ron and Hermione,
and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room
of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant.
626
The Battle of Hogwarts
I need the place where everything is hidden. Harry begged of it
inside his head, and the door materialized on their third run past.
The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them: All was silent. They were
in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its
towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone
students.
“And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his
voice echoing in the silence.
“He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for
him I’ve had to hide stuff in my time . . . this way,” he added. “I
think it’s down here. . . .”
He passed the stuffed troll and the Vanish Cabinet Draco Malfoy had mended last year with such disastrous consequenecs, then
hesitated, looking up and down aisles of junk; he could not remember we to go next. . . .
“Accio Diadem!” cried Hermioen in desperation, but nothing
flew through the air toward them. It seemed that, like the vault at
Gringotts, the room would not yield its hidden objects that easily.
“Let’s split up.” Harry told the other two. “Look for a stone
bust of an old man wearing a wig an a tiara! It’s standing on a
cupboard and it’s definitely somewhere around here. . . .”
They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’
footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles,
hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats. . . .
“Somewhere near here,” Harry muttered to himself.
“Somewhere . . . somewhere . . . ”
Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room. His
627
Chapter 31
breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver.
There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he
had hidden his old Potions book, and on top of it, the pockmarked
stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an
ancient discolored tiara.
He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained few
feet away, when a voice behind him said, “Hold it, Potter.”
He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were
standing behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right
at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces he
saw Draco Malfoy.
“That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” said Malfoy, pointing
his own through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle.
“Not anymore,” panted Harry, tightening his grip on the
hawthorn wand. “Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you
theirs?”
“My mother,” said Draco.
Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about
the situation. He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They
seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem.
“So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” asked Harry.
“We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe. His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person: Harry had hardly ever
heard him speak before. Crabbe was speaking like a small child
promised a large bag of sweets. “We ’ung back, Potter. We decided
not to go. Decided to bring you to ’im.”
“Good plan,” said Harry in mock admiration. He could not
believe that he was this close, and was going to be thwarted by
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward
628
The Battle of Hogwarts
toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If
he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out . . .
“So how did you get in here?” he asked, trying to distract them.
“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,”
said Malfoy, his voice brittle. “I know how to get in.”
“We was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted Goyle. “We
can do Diss-lusion Charms now! And then,” his face split into a
gormless grin, “you turned up right in front of us and said you was
looking for a die-dum! What’s a die-dum?”
“Harry?” Ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of
the wall to Harry’s right. “Are you talking to someone?”
With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the
fifty foot mountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books
and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, “Descendo!”
The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the
aisle next door where Ron stood.
“Ron!” Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione
screamed, and Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the
floor on the other side of the destabilized wall: He pointed his
wand at the rampart, cried, “Finite!” and it steadied.
“No!” shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe’s arm as the latter made
to repeat his spell. “If you wreck the room you might bury this
diadem thing!”
“What’s that matter?” said Crabbe, tugging himself free. “It’s
Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?”
“Potter came in here to get it,” said Malfoy with ill-disguised
impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues. “so that must
mean— “
“‘Must mean’?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised
629
Chapter 31
ferocity. “Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no
more, Draco. You an’ your dad are finished.”
“Harry?” shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk
wad. “What’s going on?”
“Harry?” mimicked Crabbe. “What’s going on—no, Potter!
Crucio!”
Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed him but
hit the stone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which
the bust had rested.
“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through
the enormous room. “The Dark Lord wants him alive— “
“So? I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, throwing off
Malfoy’s restraining arm. “But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants
him dead anyway, what’s the diff—?”
A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione
had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell
straight at Crabbe’s head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled
him out of the way.
“It’s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!”
Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had
aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning
Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy’s
wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of
broken furniture and bones.
“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at Crabbe
and Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second’s
hesitation was all Harry needed.
“Expelliarmus!”
630
The Battle of Hogwarts
Goyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the
bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot,
trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione’s
second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of
the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly
missed.
Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, “Avada Kedavra!”
again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. The
wand-less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell
as she came.
“It’s somewhere here!” Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile
of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. “Look for it while I go
and help R— “
“HARRY!” she screamed.
A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment’s
warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as
hard as they could up the aisle toward them.
“Like it hot, scum?” roared Crabbe as he ran.
But he seemed to have no control over what he had done.
Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides
of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch.
“Aguamenti!” Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared
from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air.
“RUN!”
Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along;
Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron,
and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them.
It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had
631
Chapter 31
no knowledge. As they turned a corner the flames chased them as
though they were alive, sentient, intent upon killing them. Now the
fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming
serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and
the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up
into the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet,
before being consumed by the inferno.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron
and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them,
drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and
the heat was solid as a wall around them.
“What can we do?” Hermione screamed over the deafening
roars of the fire. “What can we do?”
“Here!”
Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it
behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with
hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, missing by feet
the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them.
The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them
the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of
hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in
the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle
anywhere. He swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire:
What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . .
“Harry, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed Ron, though it
was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke.
632
The Battle of Hogwarts
And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from
amidst the terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame.
“It’s— too—dangerous—!” Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in
the air. His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the
smoke, he raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb
or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . .
And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious
Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks,
and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but
even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good.
Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy’s hand, covered in sweat, slid
instantly out of Harry’s—
“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” roared
Ron’s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon
them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose,
rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered
up behind Harry.
“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed Malfoy in
Harry’s ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and
Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe:
and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring
flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast
them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace,
and an old, discolored tiara—
“What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way!”
screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The
diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it
dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had
it, caught it around his wrist—
633
Chapter 31
Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared
upward and straight toward the place where, he prayed, the door
stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was
screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the
smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the
broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they
collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.
Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing,
and retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room
of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat panting
on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious.
“C–Crabbe,” choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. “C–
Crabbe . . . ”
“He’s dead,” said Ron harshly.
There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a
number of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of
transparent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming
with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when
the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was
still going on all around him. He could hear more scream than
those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him.
“Where’s Ginny?” he said sharply. “She was here. She was
supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.”
“Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire?” asked
Ron, but he too got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left
and right. “Shall we split up and look—?”
“No,” said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle
remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them
had wands. “Let’s stick together. I say we go—Harry, what’s that
634
The Battle of Hogwarts
on your arm?”
“What? Oh yeah— “
He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still
hot, blackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just
able to make out the tiny words etched upon it; WIT BEYOND
MEASURE IS MAN’S GREATEST TREASURE.
A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking
from the diadem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently,
then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard
the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the
grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented
in his fingers.
“It must have been Fiendfyre!” whimpered Hermione, her eyes
on the broken piece.
“Sorry?”
“Fiendfyre-cursed fire — it’s one of the substances that destroy
Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it’s so dangerous — how did Crabbe know how to—?”
“Must’ve learned from the Carrows,” said Harry grimly.
“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to
stop it, really,” said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione’s, was singed,
and whose face was blackened. “If he hadn’t tried to kill us all, I’d
be quite sorry he was dead.”
“But don’t you realize?” whispered Hermione. “This means, if
we can just get the snake— “
But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable
noises of dueling filled the corridor. Harry looked around and his
heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred
and Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked
635
Chapter 31
and hooded men.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light
flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast:
Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked
hair—
“Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight
at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of
his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. “Did I mention I’m
resigning?”
“You’re joking, Perce!” shouted Fred as the Death Eater he
was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning
Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea
urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee.
“You actually are joking, Perce. . . . I don’t think I’ve heard you
joke since you were— “
The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry,
Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their
feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment
of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world
was rent apart, Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he
could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood
that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms:
He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope
of knowing what had happened to them—
And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness:
He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been
subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of
the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek
636
The Battle of Hogwarts
told him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible
cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more
frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps,
than he had been in his life. . . .
And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and
three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall
had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione’s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood.
“No—no—no!” someone was shouting. “No! Fred! No!” And
Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them,
and Fred’s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh
still etched upon his face.
637
Chapter 32
The Elder Wand
T
he world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased,
the castle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant
laid down their arms? Harry’s mind was in free fall,
spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all
his senses must be lying—
And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the
school and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the
wall behind their heads.
“Get down!” Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the
night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her
to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred’s body, shielding it from
further harm, and when Harry shouted “Percy, come on, we’ve got
to move!” he shook his head.
“Percy!” Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating
Ron’s face as he seized his elder brother’s shoulders and pulled,
but Percy would not budge. “Percy, you can’t do anything for
him! We’re going to— ”
638
The Elder Wand
Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask
why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb
through the huge hole in the wall. One of Aragog’s descendants
had joined the fight.
Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the
monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness.
“It brought friends!” Harry called to the others, glancing over
the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had
blasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building,
liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters
must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon
them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled
back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came
soaring over Harry’s head, so close he felt the force of them blow
his hair.
“Let’s move, NOW!”
Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to
seize Fred’s body under the armpit. Percy, realizing what Harry
was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped: together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the
grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way.
“Here,” said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit
of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a
second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body
was well-hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and
Goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor, which was now
full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from windows, he
saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends
639
Chapter 32
or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a
bull-like roar: “ROOKWOOD!” and sprinted off in the direction
of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students.
“Harry, in here!” Hermione screamed.
She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be
wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that
they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying
to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy.
“Listen to me—LISTEN RON !”
“I wanna help— I wanna kill Death Eaters— ”
His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he
was shaking with rage and grief.
“Ron, we’re the only ones who can end it! Please—Ron—we
need the snake, we’ve got to kill the snake!” said Hermione.
But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could
not bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to
punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to
find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure,
that Ginny was not—but he could not permit that idea to form in
his mind—
“We will fight!” Hermione said. “We’ll have to, to reach the
snake! But let’s not lose sight now of what we’re supposed to be
d–doing! We’re the only ones who can end it!”
She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and
singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to
calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to
Harry. “You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he’ll
have the snake with him, won’t he? Do it, Harry—look inside
him!”
640
The Elder Wand
Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for
hours, yearning to show him Voldemort’s thoughts? He closed his
eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and
all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they
became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them. . . .
He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows
boarded up except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle
were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed
distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room
was dark except for a solitary oil lamp.
He was rolling his wand between his fingers, watching it, his
thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever
found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever and
cunning and inquisitive to discover . . . He was confident that the
boy would not find the diadem . . . although Dumbledore’s puppet
had come much farther than he ever expected . . . too far. . . .
“My Lord,” said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned:
there was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and
still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the
boy’s last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. “My
Lord . . . please . . . my son . . . ”
“If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come
and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided
to befriend Harry Potter?”
“No—never,” whispered Malfoy.
“You must hope not.”
“Aren’t— aren’t you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die
at another hand but yours?” asked Malfoy, his voice shaking.
641
Chapter 32
“Wouldn’t it be . . . forgive me . . . more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek him y–yourself?”
“Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that
you can discover what has happened to your son. And I do not
need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come
to find me.”
Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his
fingers. It troubled him . . . and those things that troubled Lord
Voldemort needed to be rearranged. . . .
“Go and fetch Snape.”
“Snape, m–my Lord?”
“Snape. Now. I need him. There is a— service— I require from
him. Go.”
Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left
the room. Voldemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand
between his fingers, staring at it.
“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked
around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in
midair, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space
he had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank.
With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes at the same
moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the
smashes and bangs of battle.
“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got
some sort of magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.” “Voldemort’s sitting in the shrieking Shack?” said Hermione, outraged. “He’s not—he’s not even
fighting??”
642
The Elder Wand
“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks
I’m going to go to him.”
“But why?”
“He knows I’m after Horcruxes—he’s keeping Nagini close beside him— obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near
the thing— ”
“Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders. “So you can’t go,
that’s what he wants, what he’s expecting. You stay here and look
after Hermione, and I’ll go and get it— ”
Harry cut across Ron.
“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as
soon as I— ”
“No,” said Hermione, “it makes much more sense if I take the
Cloak and— ”
“Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her.
Before Hermione could get farther than “Ron, I’m just as
capable— ” the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they
stood was ripped open.
“POTTER!”
Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their
wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted “Glisseo!”
The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she,
Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but
so fast that the Death Eaters’ Stunning Spells flew far over their
heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom
and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall.
“Duro!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry,
and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned
to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.
643
Chapter 32
“Get back!” shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled
themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered
past, shepherded by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared not to notice them. Her hair had come down and there
was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her
scream, “CHARGE!”
“Harry, you get the Cloak on,” said Hermione. “Never mind
us—
“But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were
he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the
dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells.
They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a
corridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters
were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement,
while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students
and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-toface with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers
were weaving and darting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of their own side if they cast curses. Even
as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there
came a great “Wheeeeeeeeeeee!” and looking up, Harry saw Peeves
zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death
Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms.
“Argh!”
A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; the damp
green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to
shake them loose.
644
The Elder Wand
“Someone’s invisible there!” shouted a masked Death Eater,
pointing.
Dean made the most of the Death Eater’s momentary distraction, knocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted
to retaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him.
“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down,
through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance
hall.
“I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m Draco, I’m on your side!”
Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked
Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him
from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death
Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused.
“And that’s the second time we’ve saved your life tonight, you
two-faced bastard!” Ron yelled.
There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall.
Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front
doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling
Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction; some
carrying or dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunning
Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit
Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of
Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase:
glass shattered on the left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had
645
Chapter 32
recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the
balcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that Harry
took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its teeth
into one of the fallen.
“NO!” shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her
wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and
struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and
a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to
the ground and did not move.
“I have more!” shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the
banisters. “More for any who want them! Here— ”
And with a move like a tennis serve, she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air,
and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a
window. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst
open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the
front hall.
Screams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death
Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew
into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and
reared, more terrifying than ever.
“How do we get out?” yelled Ron over all the screaming, but
before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled
aside; Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing
his flowery pink umbrella.
“Don’t hurt ’em, don’t hurt ’em!” he yelled.
“HAGRID, NO!”
646
The Elder Wand
Harry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the
cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the
whole hall.
“HAGRID, COME BACK!” But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders,
and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.
“HAGRID!”
Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or
foe he did not care: He was sprinting down the front steps into
the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their
prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all.
“HAGRID!”
He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from
the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them,
his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out
of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder.
He looked up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head
hidden in shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated
by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement,
it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass
rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of the
doorway.
“Oh my—!” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with
Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people
through the window above.
“DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised
her wand. “Stun him and he’ll crush half the castle— ”
“HAGGER?”
647
Chapter 32
Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now
did Harry realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant.
The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors
turned around and let out a roar. The stone steps trembled as
he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp’s lopsided mouth
fell open, showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they
launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.
“RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and
blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione’s hand and
tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear.
Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast
that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought
up short again.
The air around them had frozen: Harry’s breath caught and
solidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling
figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards
the castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling . . .
Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the
night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already
dead . . .
“Come on, Harry!” said Hermione’s voice from a very long way
away. “Patronuses, Harry, come on!” he raised his wand, but a
dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him: How many more
lay dead that he did not yet know about? He felt as though his
soul had already half left his body. . . .
“HARRY, COME ON!” screamed Hermione.
A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them,
648
The Elder Wand
sucking their way closer to Harry’s despair, which was like a
promise of a feast. . . .
He saw Ron’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly,
and expire; he saw Hermione’s otter twist in midair and fade, and
his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the
oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling. . . .
And then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron,
and Hermione’s heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures’
approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to
stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast
Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus.
“That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back
in the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice
for the D.A., “That’s right, Harry . . . come on think of something
happy. . . .”
“Something happy?” he said, his voice cracked.
“We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we’re still fighting. Come
on, now. . . .”
There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with
the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the
end of Harry’s wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors
scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again,
but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears.
“Can’t thank you enough,” said Ron shakily, turning to Luna,
Ernie, and Seamus “you just saved— ”
With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came
lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them.
“RUN!” Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling;
649
Chapter 32
They all scattered, and not a second too soon, for the next moment
the creature’s vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been
standing. Harry looked round: Ron and Hermione were following
him, but the other three had vanished back into the battle.
“Let’s get out of range!” yelled Ron as the giant swung its club
again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds
where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the
darkness.
“The Whomping willow,” said Harry, “go!”
Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a
small space into which he could not look now: thoughts of Fred
and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in
and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had
to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione
said, the only way to end it—
He sprinted, half—believing he could outdistance death itself,
ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and
the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the
Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds
that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster
than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the
great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots
with whiplike, slashing branches.
Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow’s
swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its tick
trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that
would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out
of breath that she could not speak.
“How—how’re we going to get in?” panted Ron. “I can— see
650
The Elder Wand
the place—if we just had—Crookshanks again— ”
“Crookshanks?” wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her
chest. “Are you a wizard, or what?”
“Oh— right—yeah— ”
Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the
ground and said “Wingardium Leviosa!” The twig flew up from
the ground, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind,
then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow’s ominously
swaying branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once,
the writhing tree became still.
“Perfect!” panted Hermione.
“Wait.”
For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the
battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do
this, wanted him to come. . . . Was he leading Ron and Hermione
into a trap?
But the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the
only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where
Voldemort was, and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . .
“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him
forward.
Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s
roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last
time they had entered it. The tunnel was low—ceilinged: they
had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first,
his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers,
but none came. They moved in silence, Harry’s gaze fixed upon
the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist.
651
Chapter 32
At last, the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a
sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.
“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!”
He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery
cloth into his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself,
murmured, “Nox,” extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on
his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining,
expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice,
see a flash of green light.
And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead
of them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the
end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an
old crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he
opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall.
The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini,
swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He
could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying
with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry’s heart lurched: Snape
was inches away from where he crouched, hidden.
“ . . . my Lord, their resistance is crumbling— ”
“— and it is doing so without your help,” said Voldemort in
his high, clear voice. “Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I
do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost
there . . . almost.”
“Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can
find him, my Lord. Please.”
Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping
his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell
652
The Elder Wand
that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could
not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away
his position. . . .
Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes,
the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly
in the semidarkness.
“I have a problem, Severus,” said Voldemort softly.
“My Lord?” said Snape.
Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and
precisely as a conductor’s baton.
“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?”
In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing
slightly as it coiled and uncoiled— or was it Voldemort’s sibilant
sigh lingering on the air?
“My—my lord?” said Snape blankly. “I do not understand.
You—you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.”
“No,” said Voldemort. “I have performed my usual magic. I
am extraordinary, but this wand . . . no. It has not revealed the
wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand
and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.”
Voldemort’s tone was musing, calm, but Harry’s scar had begun
to throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could
feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort.
“No difference,” said Voldemort again.
Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered
whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words
to reassure his master.
Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight
of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured
653
Chapter 32
voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry.
“I have thought long and hard, Severus . . . do you know why I
have called you back from battle?”
And for a moment Harry saw Snape’s profile. His eyes were
fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage.
“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find
Potter.”
“You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as
I do. He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I knew
his weakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the
others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it
happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.”
“But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other
than yourself— ”
“My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear.
Capture Potter. Kill his friends— the more, the better—but do
not kill him.
“But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry
Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.”
“My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But—let me go and
find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can— ”
“I have told you, no!” said Voldemort, and Harry caught the
glint of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his
cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort’s
impatience in his burning scar. “My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!”
“My Lord, there can be no question, surely—?”
“—but there is a question, Severus. There is.”
Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he
654
The Elder Wand
slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape.
“Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at
Harry Potter?”
“I— I cannot answer that, my Lord.”
“Can’t you?”
The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry’s head:
he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying
out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort,
looking into Snape’s pale face.
“My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus,
except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me
under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another’s wand. I
did so, but Lucius’s wand shattered upon meeting Potter’s.”
“I— I have no explanation, my Lord.”
Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were
still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.
“I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand
of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I
took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.”
And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape’s face was like
a death mask. It was marble white and so still that when he spoke,
it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes.
“My Lord—let me go to the boy— ”
“All this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have
sat here,” said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper,
“wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it
ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for
its rightful owner . . . and I think I have the answer.”
Snape did not speak.
655
Chapter 32
“Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all,
Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret
what must happen.”
“My Lord— ”
“The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because
I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard
who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While
you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.”
“My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand.
“It cannot be any other way,” said Voldemort. “I must master
the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.”
And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did
nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had
been reprieved: but then Voldemort’s intention became clear. The
snake’s cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do
anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders,
and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.
“Kill.”
There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape’s face losing the
little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the
snake’s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted
cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor.
“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly.
He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was
time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would
now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding
the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto
the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort
swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great
656
The Elder Wand
serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere.
Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes;
He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not
to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between
crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the
floor.
“Harry!” breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already
pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch
into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could,
he pulled himself up into the room.
He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching
the dying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape’s
white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound
at his neck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down
upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry
as he cried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the
front of his robes and pulled him close.
A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s throat.
“Take . . . it. . . . Take . . . it. . . .”
Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery
blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears
and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what
to do—
A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking
hand by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with
his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked
as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry’s robes
slackened.
“Look . . . at . . . me. . . .” he whispered.
657
Chapter 32
The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something
in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed,
blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor,
and Snape moved no more.
658
Chapter 33
The Prince’s Tale
H
arry remained kneeling at Snape’s side, simply staring
down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice
spoke so close to them that Harry jumped on his feet,
the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that
Voldemort had reentered the room.
Voldemort’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and
Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still
fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside
them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away.
“You have fought,” said the high, cold voice, “valiantly. Lord
Voldemort knows how to value bravery.
“Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist
me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen.
Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste.
“Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat
immediately.
“You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat
659
Chapter 33
your injured.
“I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted
your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall
wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that
hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then
battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry
Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man,
woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One
hour.”
Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking
at Harry.
“Don’t listen to him,” said Ron.
“It’ll be all right,” said Hermione wildly. “Let’s—let’s get back
to the castle, if he’s gone to the forest we’ll need to think of a new
plan— ”
She glanced at Snape’s body, then hurried back to the tunnel
entrance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility
Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel,
except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for
which it had been done . . .
They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking,
and Harry wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear
Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could.
You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than
face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden
Forest . . . One hour . . .
Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle
(?). It could only be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitchblack. The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone
660
The Prince’s Tale
dog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There
was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker.
The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of
light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the
deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were
still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and
splintered wood. Part of the banisters had been blown away.
“Where is everyone?” whispered Hermione.
Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway.
The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The
survivors stood in groups, their arms around each other’s necks.
The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam
Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured;
his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand.
The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could
not see Fred’s body, because his family surrounded him. George
was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s
chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while
tears cascaded down his cheeks.
Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away.
Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and
blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung
an arm around Ron’s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved
closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies
lying next to Fred. Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peacefullooking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling.
The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink,
as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. He could not draw
661
Chapter 33
breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see
who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys,
could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in
the first place, Fred might never have died . . .
He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin,
Tonks . . . He yearned not to feel . . . He wished he could rip out his
heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him . . .
The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to
have joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts,
and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office.
“Password?”
“Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he
whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside
revealing the spiral staircase behind.
But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change.
The portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not
a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it
seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined
the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going
on.
Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame,
which hung directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned
his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had
always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape’s
memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the
edge. To escape into someone else’s head would be a blessed
relief . . . Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than
662
The Prince’s Tale
his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange,
and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as
though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived.
He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground.
When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted
playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline.
Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy
was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair
was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked
deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might
have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt.
Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than
nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised
greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls
swinging higher and higher than her sister.
“Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two.
But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its
arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself
skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling
on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through
the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly.
“Mummy told you not to!”
Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals
on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up,
hands on hips.
“Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!”
“But I’m fine,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at this.
Watch what I can do.”
Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart
663
Chapter 33
from themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily
had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape
lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and
disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a
clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening
and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.
“Stop it!” shrieked Petunia.
“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the
blossom and threw it back to the ground.
“It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the
flower’s flight to the ground and lingered upon it. “How do you do
it?” she added, and there was definite longing in her voice.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” Snape could no longer contain himself,
but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and
ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled,
remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance.
A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at
Lily.
“What’s obvious?” asked Lily.
Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the
distant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his
voice and said, “I know what you are.”
“What do you mean?”
“You’re . . . you’re a witch,” whispered Snape.
She looked affronted.
“That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!”
She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister.
“No!” said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it
664
The Prince’s Tale
was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He
flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older
self.
The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding
on to one of the swing poles, as though it was the safe place in tag.
“You are,” said Snape to Lily. “You are a witch. I’ve been
watching you for a while. But there’s nothing wrong with that.
My mum’s one, and I’m a wizard.”
Petunia’s laugh was like cold water.
“Wizard!” she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had
recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance. “I know
who you are. You’re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner’s
End by the river,” she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone
that she considered the address a poor recommendation. “Why
have you been spying on us?”
“Haven’t been spying,” said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and
dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. “Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,”
he added spitefully, “you’re a Muggle.”
Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she
could hardly mistake the tone.
“Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her
sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them
as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only
one left to observe him, recognized Snape’s bitter disappointment,
and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a
while, and that it had all gone wrong . . .
The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed
around him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could
see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast
665
Chapter 33
by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat
facing each other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed
his coat now; his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light.
“ . . . and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside
school, you get letters.”
“But I have done magic outside school!”
“We’re all right. We haven’t got wands yet. They let you off
when you’re a kid and you can’t help it. But once you’re eleven,”
he nodded importantly, “and they start training you, then you’ve
got to go careful.”
There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and
twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks
trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the
boy, and said, “It is real, isn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says
you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts. It is real,
isn’t it?”
“It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get the
letter, you and me.”
“Really?” whispered Lily.
“Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and
his odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in
front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny.
“And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered.
“Normally,” said Snape. “But you’re Muggle-born, so someone
from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.”
“Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?”
Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom,
moved over the pale face, the dark red hair.
“No,” he said. “It doesn’t make any difference.”
666
The Prince’s Tale
“Good,” said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been
worrying.
“You’ve got loads of magic,” said Snape. “I saw that. All the
time I was watching you . . . ”
His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched
out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves
overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the
playground.
“How are things at your house?” Lily asked.
A little crease appeared between his eyes.
“Fine,” he said.
“They’re not arguing anymore?”
“Oh yes, they’re arguing,” said Snape. He picked up a fistful of
leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what
he was doing. “But it won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.”
“Doesn’t your dad like magic?”
“He doesn’t like anything, much,” said Snape.
“Severus?”
A little smile twisted Snape’s mouth when she said his name.
“Yeah?”
“Tell me about the dementors again.”
“What d’you want to know about them for?”
“If I use magic outside school— ”
“They wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors
are for people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard
prison, Azkaban. You’re not going to end up in Azkaban, you’re
too— ”
He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small
rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind
667
Chapter 33
a tree, had lost her footing.
“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but
Snape had jumped to his feet.
“Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?”
Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could
see her struggling for something hurtful to say.
“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, pointing at
Snape’s chest. “Your mum’s blouse?”
There was a crack. A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen.
Lily screamed. The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and
she staggered backward and burst into tears.
“Tuney!”
But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape.
“Did you make that happen?”
“No.” He looked both defiant and scared.
“You did!” She was backing away from him. “You did! You
hurt her!”
“No—no, I didn’t!”
But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look,
she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked
miserable and confused . . .
And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on
platform nine and three quarters, and Snape stood beside him,
slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman
who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four
a short distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their
parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister. Harry moved
closer to listen.
“ . . . I’m sorry, Tuney, I’m sorry! Listen— ” She caught her
668
The Prince’s Tale
sister’s hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull
it away. “Maybe once I’m there—no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once
I’m there, I’ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade
him to change his mind!”
“I don’t—want— to— go!” said Petunia, and she dragged her
hand back out of her sister’s grasp. “You think I want to go to
some stupid castle and learn to be a–a . . . ”
Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in
their owners’ arms, over the owls, fluttering and hooting at each
other in cages, over the students, some already in their long black
robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting
one another with glad cries after a summer apart.
“—you think I want to be a–a freak?”
Lily’s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her
hand away.
“I’m not a freak,” said Lily. “That’s a horrible thing to say.”
“That’s where you’re going,” said Petunia with relish. “A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy . . . weirdos, that’s
what you two are. It’s good you’re being separated from normal
people. It’s for our safety.”
Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the
platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the
scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice was low
and fierce.
“You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote
to the headmaster and begged him to take you.”
Petunia turned scarlet.
“Beg? I didn’t beg!”
“I saw his reply. It was very kind.”
669
Chapter 33
“You shouldn’t have read— ” whispered Petunia, “that was my
private—how could you—?”
Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape
stood nearby. Petunia gasped.
“That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in
my room!”
“No—not sneaking— ” Now Lily was on the defensive. “Severus saw the envelope, and he couldn’t believe a Muggle could have
contacted Hogwarts, that’s all! He says there must be wizards
working undercover in the postal service who take care of— ”
“Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!” said
Petunia, now as pale as she had been flushed. “Freak!” she spat
at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood . . .
The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps
taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes.
At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of
rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the
window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane.
Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite
Lily. She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window.
She had been crying.
“I don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice.
“Why not?”
“Tuney h–hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.”
“So what?”
She threw him a look of deep dislike.
670
The Prince’s Tale
“So she’s my sister!”
“She’s only a— ” He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him.
“But we’re going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration
in his voice. “This is it! We’re off to Hogwarts!”
She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half
smiled.
“You’d better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she
had brightened a little.
“Slytherin?”
One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no
interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at
the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on
the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like
Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for,
even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked.
“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t
you?” James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him,
and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not
smile.
“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said.
“Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!”
Sirius grinned.
“Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if
you’ve got the choice?”
James lifted an invisible sword.
“‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.”
Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him.
“Got a problem with that?”
671
Chapter 33
“No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. “If
you’d rather be brawny than brainy— ”
“Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” interjected Sirius.
James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and
looked from James to Sirius in dislike.
“Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.”
“Oooooo . . . ”
James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip
Snape as he passed.
“See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the compartment door
slammed . . .
And the scene dissolved once more . . .
Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, “Evans, Lily!”
He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit
down upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the
Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had touched
the dark red hair, the hat cried, “Gryffindor!”
Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat,
handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the
cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape,
and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius
move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at
him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and
firmly turned her back on him.
The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and
his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when
672
The Prince’s Tale
only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall
called Snape.
Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat
upon his head. “Slytherin!” cried the Sorting Hat.
And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away
from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where
Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted
Snape on the back as he sat down beside him . . .
And the scene changed . . .
Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in.
As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were.
A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting.
“ . . . thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying, “Best friends?”
“We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging
round with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber!
What do you see in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he
tried to do to Mary MacDonald the other day?”
Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into
the thin, sallow face.
“That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that’s all— ”
“It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny— ”
“What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded Snape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed,
to hold in his resentment.
“What’s Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily.
“They sneak out at night. There’s something weird about that
Lupin. Where does he keep going?”
673
Chapter 33
“He’s ill,” said Lily. “They say he’s ill— ”
“Every month at the full moon?” said Snape.
“I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why
are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what
they’re doing at night?”
“I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.”
The intensity of his gaze made her blush.
“They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice.
“And you’re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the
other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever’s down
there— ”
Snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, “Saved? Saved?
You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and
his friends’ too! You’re not going to— I won’t let you— ”
“Let me? Let me?”
Lily’s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once.
“I didn’t mean— I just don’t want to see you made a fool of—
He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!” The words seemed
wrenched from him against his will. “And he’s not . . . everyone
thinks . . . big Quidditch hero— ” Snape’s bitterness and dislike
were rendering him incoherent, and Lily’s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead.
“I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag,” she said, cutting
across Snape. “I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber’s and
Avery’s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand
how you can be friends with them.”
Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on
674
The Prince’s Tale
Mulciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter,
his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a
new spring in Snape’s step . . .
And the scene dissolved . . .
Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting
his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the
place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because
he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the
air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it
gave him no pleasure to hear it again . . . He watched as Lily joined
the group and went to Snape’s defense. Distantly he heard Snape
shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word:
“Mudblood.”
The scene changed . . .
“I’m sorry.”
“I’m not interested.”
“I’m sorry!”
“Save your breath.”
It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood
with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at
the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
“I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening
to sleep here.”
“I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood,
it just— ”
“Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily’s voice. “It’s too
late. I’ve made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can
675
Chapter 33
understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little
Death Eater friends—you see, you don’t even deny it! You don’t
even deny that’s what you’re all aiming to be! You can’t wait to
join You-Know-Who, can you?”
He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.
“I can’t pretend anymore. You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen
mine.”
“No—listen, I didn’t mean— ”
“— to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth
Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?”
He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous
look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole . . .
The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to
reform: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors
until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop,
forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the
branches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting,
turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting
for something or for someone . . . His fear infected Harry too, even
though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over
his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for—
Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air.
Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees
and his wand had flown out of his hand.
“Don’t kill me!”
“That was not my intention.”
Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by
the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape
with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated
676
The Prince’s Tale
from below in the light cast by his wand.
“Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for
me?”
“No—no message— I’m here on my own account!”
Snape was wringing his hands. He looked a little mad, with his
straggling black hair flying around him.
“I— I come with a warning—no, a request—please— ”
Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still
flew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot
where he and Snape faced each other.
“What request could a Death Eater make of me?”
“The— the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . Trelawney . . . ”
“Ah, yes,” said Dumbledore. “How much did you relay to Lord
Voldemort?”
“Everything—everything I heard!” said Snape. “That is
why—it is for that reason—he thinks it means Lily Evans!”
“The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said Dumbledore.
“It spoke of a boy born at the end of July— ”
“You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is
going to hunt her down—kill them all— ”
“If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord
Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the
mother, in exchange for the son?”
“I have— I have asked him— ”
“You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard
so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little,
“You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child?
They can die, as long as you have what you want?”
Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.
677
Chapter 33
“Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her— them— safe.
Please.”
“And what will you give me in return, Severus?”
“In—in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.”
The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and
something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal.
Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised
his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years
of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.
“I thought . . . you were going . . . to keep her . . . safe . . . ”
“She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” said Dumbledore. “Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord
Voldemort would spare her?”
Snape’s breathing was shallow.
“Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore.
With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly.
“Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans’s eyes, I am sure?”
“DON’T!” bellowed Snape. “Gone . . . dead . . . ”
“Is this remorse, Severus?”
“I wish . . . I wish I were dead . . . ”
“And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore
coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your
way forward is clear.”
Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s
678
The Prince’s Tale
words appeared to take a long time to reach him.
“What—what do you mean?”
“You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in
vain. Help me protect Lily’s son.”
“He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone— ”
“The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible
danger when he does.”
There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of
himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well.
Very well. But never—never tell, Dumbledore! This must be
between us! Swear it! I cannot bear . . . especially Potter’s son . . . I
want your word!”
“My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of
you?” Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious,
anguished face. “If you insist . . . ”
The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing
up and down in front of Dumbledore.
“—mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rulebreaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and
impertinent— ”
“You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore,
without raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today.
“Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.”
Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, “Keep
an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?”
A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and
Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last
stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed.
679
Chapter 33
“Well?” murmured Dumbledore.
“Karkaroff’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking,
he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.” Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore’s crooked-nosed profile. “Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark
burns.”
“Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and
Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. “And are you
tempted to join him?”
“No,” said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and Roger’s retreating figures. “I am not such a coward.”
“No,” agreed Dumbledore. “You are a braver man by far than
Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon . . . ”
He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken . . .
And now Harry stood in the headmaster’s office yet again. It
was nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike
chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand
dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering
incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while
with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion
down Dumbledore’s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore’s
eyelids fluttered and opened.
“Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “why did you put on
that ring? It carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even
touch it?”
Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It
was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.
Dumbledore grimaced.
“I . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . . ”
680
The Prince’s Tale
“Tempted by what?”
Dumbledore did not answer.
“It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape sounded
furious. “That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to
contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one
hand for the time being— ”
Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined
it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio.
“You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I
have?”
Dumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It
will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over
time.”
Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to
live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him.
“I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.”
“If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have
been able to do more, buy you more time!” said Snape furiously.
He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. “Did you think
that breaking the ring would break the curse?”
“Something like that . . . I was delirious, no doubt . . . ” said
Dumbledore. With an effort he straightened himself in his chair.
“Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.”
Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled.
“I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His
plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.”
Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across
681
Chapter 33
the desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say
more on the subject of Dumbledore’s cursed hand, but the other
held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling,
Snape said, “The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed.
This is merely punishment for Lucius’s recent failures. Slow torture
for Draco’s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.”
“In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon
him as surely as I have,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I should have
thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?”
There was a short pause.
“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.”
“Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he
will not need a spy at Hogwarts?”
“He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.”
“And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it
seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your
power to protect the students at Hogwarts?”
Snape gave a stiff nod.
“Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what
Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others
as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to
accept, he likes you— ”
“—much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me,
he thinks I have usurped Lucius’s position.”
“All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for
accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy.
Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are
to save him from Lord Voldemort’s wrath.”
682
The Prince’s Tale
Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked,
“Are you intending to let him kill you?”
“Certainly not. You must kill me.”
There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise.
Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.
“Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice
heavy with irony. “Or would you like a few moments to compose
an epitaph?”
“Oh, not quite yet,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I daresay the
moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened
tonight,” he indicated his withered hand, “we can be sure that it
will happen within a year.”
“If you don’t mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let
Draco do it?”
“That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I
would not have it ripped apart on my account.”
“And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”
“You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an
old man avoid pain and humiliation,” said Dumbledore. “I ask
this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for
me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this
year’s league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the
protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is
involved— I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix,
who likes to play with her food before she eats it.”
His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had
frequently pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was
visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod.
Dumbledore seemed satisfied.
683
Chapter 33
“Thank you, Severus . . . ”
The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were
strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.
“What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are
closeted together?” Snape asked abruptly.
Dumbledore looked weary.
“Why? You aren’t trying to give him more detentions, Severus?
The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.”
“He is his father over again— ”
“In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his
mother’s. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss
with him, information I must give him before it is too late.”
“Information,” repeated Snape. “You trust him . . . you do not
trust me.”
“It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited
time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him
to do what he needs to do.”
“And why may I not have the same information?”
“I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly
not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord
Voldemort.”
“Which I do on your orders!”
“And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself, Severus.
To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while
withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but
you.”
“Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection
684
The Prince’s Tale
into the Dark Lord’s mind!”
“Voldemort fears that connection,” said Dumbledore. “Not so
long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry’s mind
means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He
will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that
way.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like
flesh in flame— ”
“Souls? We were talking of minds!”
“In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is
to speak of the other.”
Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone.
They were close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no
sign of anyone near them.
“After you have killed me, Severus— ”
“You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small
service of me!” snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face
now. “You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I
have changed my mind!”
“You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking
about services you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close
eye on our young Slytherin friend?”
Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed.
“Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall
not complain that I have no confidence in you . . . ”
They were back in Dumbledore’s office, the windows dark, and
Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked
685
Chapter 33
around him, talking.
“Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it
is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what
must be done?”
“But what must he do?”
“That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus.
There will come a time— after my death—do not argue, do not
interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem
to fear for the life of his snake.”
“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops
sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside
him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell
Harry.”
“Tell him what?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him,
when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing
Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself
onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building. Part of
Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him
the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and
protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.”
Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a
long tunnel, they were so far away from him, their voices echoing
strangely in his ears.
686
The Prince’s Tale
“So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly.
“And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.”
Another long silence. Then Snape said, “I thought . . . all those
years . . . that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.”
“We have protected him because it has been essential to teach
him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore,
his eyes still tight shut. “Meanwhile, the connection between them
grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth. Sometimes I have thought
he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters
so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean
the end of Voldemort.”
Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.
“You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?”
“Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have
you watched die?”
“Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He
stood up. “You have used me.”
“Meaning?”
“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s
son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for
slaughter— ”
“But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously.
“Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?”
“For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!”
From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on
the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of
the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery
687
Chapter 33
glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.
“After all this time?”
“Always,” said Snape.
And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the
portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk.
“You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry’s
departure from his aunt and uncle’s,” said Dumbledore. “Not to
do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well
informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I
think, ought to ensure Harry’s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus
Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase,
be sure to act your part convincingly . . . I am counting upon you
to remain in Lord Voldemort’s good books as long as possible, or
Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows . . . ”
Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar
tavern, Mundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning
in concentration.
“You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape murmured, “that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters.
It’s the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have
suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?”
“I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused . . .
Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through
a clear dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death
Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really
George . . . A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his
wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back.
“Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape.
688
The Prince’s Tale
But the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand hand, missed
and hit George instead—
And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old bedroom. Tears
were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old
letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words:
could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I
think her mind’s going, personally! Lots of love,
Lily
Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and
tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he
was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed,
throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor,
under the chest of drawers . . .
And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as
Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into his portrait.
“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The
Mudblood— ”
“Do not use that word!”
“— the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened
her bag and I heard her!”
“Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind
the headmaster’s chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget
that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor— and he
must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s
mind and see you acting for him— ”
“I know,” said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of
Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a
hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor.
689
Chapter 33
“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to
give Potter the sword?” said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak
over his robes.
“No, I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “He will
know what to do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they
may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley’s
mishap— ”
Snape turned at the door.
“Don’t worry, Dumbledore,” he said coolly. “I have a plan . . . ”
And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve,
and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same
room; Snape might just have closed the door.
690
Chapter 34
The Forest Again
F
inally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the
dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he
was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at
last that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to
walk calmly into Death’s welcoming arms. Along the way, he was
to dispose of Voldemort’s remaining links to life, so that when at
last he flung himself across Voldemort’s path, and did not raise a
wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that
ought to have been done in Godric’s Hollow would be finished:
Neither would live, neither could survive.
He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange
that in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly
keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats
were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and
walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds
and into the forest?
Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral
drum pounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times

Chapter 34
he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he had
never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had always
been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur
to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he
knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying.
If he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had
left number four, Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble
phoenix-feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died
like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened!
Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save
someone he loved. . . . He envied even his parents’ deaths now. This
cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different
kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an
effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits
on the walls were all empty.
Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive
and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had
he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and
bounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be
gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and
throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes.
Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there
had been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see
it, he realized that now. He had never questioned that his own
assumption: that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that
his life span had always been determined by how long it took to
eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of
destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip
away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life!
692
The Forest Again
How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give
the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for
slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, but another
blow against Voldemort.
And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out,
that he would keep going to the end, even though it was his end,
because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone
else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to
stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the
Great Hall forced their way back into his mind’s eye, and for a
moment he could hardly breathe: Death was impatient. . . .
But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The
snake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the
earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an
easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it. . . . Ron and
Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course. . . . That
would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two
others . . . so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they
could carry on. . . .
Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the
hard surface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must
doe. I must die. It must end.
Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country;
he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. There would
be no good-byes and no explanations, he was determined of that.
This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts
they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked
down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth
693
Chapter 34
birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his
surrender had elapsed. He stood up. His heart was leaping against
his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had little time left,
perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime’s beats before the
end. He did not look back as he closed the office door.
The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone,
as if he had already died. The portrait people were still missing
from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its
remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the
dead and the mourners were crammed.
Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended
through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into
the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be
sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever,
impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily.
Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was only half of a
pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced
down and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey,
though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe,
and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death.
“You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,” said Oliver
Wood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and
carried him into the Great Hall.
Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped
his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man.
Then he set off down the stops again into the darkness to recover
more bodies.
Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall.
People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking,
694
The Forest Again
kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people
he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other
Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he
ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this.
He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was
nearly four in the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds
felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see
whether he could do what he must.
Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another
body.
“Neville.”
“Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!”
Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out
of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure.
“Where are you going, alone?” Neville asked suspiciously.
“It’s all part of the plan,” said Harry. “There’s something I’ve
got to do. Listen—Neville— ”
“Harry!” Neville looked suddenly scared. “Harry, you’re not
thinking of handing yourself over?”
“No,” Harry lied easily. “’Course not . . . this is something else.
But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s
name, Neville? He’s got a huge snake. . . . Calls it Nagini . . . ”
“I’ve heard, yeah. . . . What about it?”
“It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just
in case they— ”
The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment,
made it impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together
again; This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool
695
Chapter 34
head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the
Horcruxes; now Neville will take Harry’s place. There would still
be three in the secret.
“Just in case they’re—busy— and you get the chance— ”
“Kill the snake?”
“Kill the snake,” Harry repeated.
“All right, Harry, You’re okay, are you?”
“I’m fine. Thanks, Neville.”
But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on.
“We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?”
“Yeah, I— ”
The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he
could not go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted
Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for
more bodies.
Harry swing the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone eyes was moving not far away, stooping over another prone
figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he realized
it was Ginny.
He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was
whispering for her mother.
“It’s all right,” Ginny was saying. “It’s okay. We’re going to
get you inside.”
“But I want to go home,” whispered the girl. “I don’t want to
fight anymore!”
“I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke. “It’s going to be all
right.”
Ripples of cold undulated over Harry’s skin. He wanted to shout
696
The Forest Again
out to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he
wanted her to know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped,
to be dragged back, to be sent back home. . . .
Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her
hand. With a huge effort Harry forced himself on. He thought he
saw Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she
had seen someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he
did not look back.
Hagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights,
no sound of Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in
welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper
kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great
bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him
save Norbert . . .
He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and
he stopped.
A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could
feel their chill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely
through it. He had no strength left for a Patronus. He could no
longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to
die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air
on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and
years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging
to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be
able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended,
the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. . . .
The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with
the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out.
I open at the close.
697
Chapter 34
Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he
wanted time to move as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped
up, and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. This was the close. This was the moment.
He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, “I am
about to die.”
The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised
Draco’s wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, “Lumos.”
The black stone with its jagged crack running down the center
sat in the two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had
cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The
triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still
discernible.
And again Harry understood without having to think. It did
not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join
them. He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him.
He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three
times.
He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements
around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on
the earthly, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the
forest. He opened his eyes and looked around.
They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They
resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary
so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. Less
substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they
moved toward him, and on each face, there was the same loving
smile.
James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing
698
The Forest Again
the clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and
ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s.
Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry
had seen him in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his
pockets and a grin on his face.
Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was
thicker and darker. He looked happy to be back in this familiar
place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings.
Lily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as
she drew close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his
face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at him
enough.
“You’ve been so brave.”
He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought
that he would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would
be enough.
“You are nearly there,” said James. “Very close. We are . . . so
proud of you.”
“Does it hurt?”
The childish question had fallen from Harry’s lips before he
could stop it.
“Dying? Not at all,” said Sirius. “Quicker and easier than
falling asleep.”
“And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,” said Lupin.
“I didn’t want you to die,” Harry said. These words came
without his volition. “Any of you. I’m sorry— ”
He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him.
“— right after you’d had your son . . . Remus, I’m sorry— ”
“I am sorry too,” said Lupin. “Sorry I will never know
699
Chapter 34
him . . . but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand.
I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.”
A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the
forest lifted the hair at Harry’s brow. He knew that they would
not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision.
“You’ll stay with me?”
“Until the very end,” said James.
“They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry.
“We are part of you,” said Sirius. “Invisible to anyone else.”
Harry looked at his mother.
“Stay close to me,” he said quietly.
And he self off. The dementors’ chill did not overcome him;
he passed through it with his companions, and they acted like
Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old
trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots
gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly
around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the
forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that
he would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked
James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage,
and the reason he was about to keep putting one foot in front of
the other.
His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not
driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who walked
beside him through the forest were much more real to him now
that the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all
the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and
slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort. . . .
700
The Forest Again
A thud and a whisper. Some other living creature had stirred
close by Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening,
and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.
“Someone there,” came a rough whisper close at hand. “He’s
got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be—?”
Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree; Their wands
flared and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius
and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything.
“Definitely heard something,” said Yaxley. “Animal, d’you
reckon?”
“That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,”
said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder.
Yaxley looked down at his watch.
“Time’s nearly up. Potter’s had his hour. He’s not coming.”
“And he was sure he’d come! He won’t be happy.”
“Better go back,” said Yaxley, “Find out what the plan is now.”
He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest.
Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly
where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled
at him, and his father nodded encouragement.
They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead,
and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry
knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once
lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarm
of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death
Eaters, to fight for their cause.
A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering
light fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters.
701
Chapter 34
Some of them were still masked and hooded; others showed their
faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive
shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock.
Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blonde
Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who
looked defeated an terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken
and full of apprehension.
Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head
bowed, and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of
him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently in his
mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought
absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind
him head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated
in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.
When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked
up.
“No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov.
Voldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to
burn in the firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his
long fingers.
“My Lord— ”
Bellatrix had spoken; She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled,
her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed.
Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak
another word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination.
“I thought he would come,” said Voldemort in his high, clear
voice, his eyes on the leaping flames. “I expected him to come.”
Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart
was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to
702
The Forest Again
escape the body he was about to cast aside. He hands were swearing as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his
robes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight.
“I was, it seems . . . mistaken,” said Voldemort.
“You weren’t.”
Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could
muster. He did not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone
slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of
his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped
forward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody
mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them.
The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants
roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many
cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood,
but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared at Harry moved
toward him, with nothing but the fire between them.
Then a voice yelled, “HARRY! NO!”
He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby.
His massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled,
desperate.
“NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT’RE YEH—?”
“QUIET!” shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand Hagrid
was silenced.
Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from
Voldemort to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that
moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the
glittering cage behind Voldemort’s head.
Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made not
attempt to draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected,
703
Chapter 34
knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses
would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at
each other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side,
considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless
smile curled the lipless mouth.
“Harry Potter,” he said very softly His voice might have been
part of the splitting fire. “The Boy Who Lived.”
None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look,
and the feel of her lips on his—
Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to
one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he
proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it
to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost
control, before he betrayed fear—
He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.
704
Chapter 35
King’s Cross
H
e lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was
there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there
himself.
A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that
he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because
he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a
sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too.
Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became
conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total
solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly.
He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In
opening them, he discovered that he had eyes.
He lay in a bright mist, through it was not like mist he had ever
experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy
vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm
nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be.
705
Chapter 35
He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face.
He was not wearing glasses anymore.
Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness
that surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that
flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slight
indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful.
For the first time, he wished he were clothed.
Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a
short distance away. He took them and put them on. They were
soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared
just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . .
He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of
Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A
great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd
thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by
in the mist. . . .
Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed
to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright
and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear
domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person
there, except for—
He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the
noise. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground,
its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight,
struggling for breath.
He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it
706
King’s Cross
was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly
nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near
enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt
like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him.
“You cannot help.”
He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him,
sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue.
“Harry,” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both
whole and white and undamaged. “You wonderful boy. You brave,
brave man. Let us walk.”
Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from
where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats
that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of
them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s
face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue
eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything
was as he had remembered it. And yet . . .
“But you’re dead.” said Harry.
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore matter-of-factly.
“Then . . . I’m dead too?”
“Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. “That is
the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.”
They looked at each other, the old man still beaming.
“Not?” repeated Harry.
“Not,” said Dumbledore.
“But . . . ” Harry raised his hand instinctively towards the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. “But I should have died— I
didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!”
707
Chapter 35
“And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the
difference.”
Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like
fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably, content.
“Explain,” said Harry.
“But you already know,” said Dumbledore. He twiddled his
thumbs together.
“I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?”
“You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!”
“So the part of his soul that was in me . . . ”
Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry
onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face.
“ . . . has it gone?”
“Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul
is whole, and completely your own, Harry.”
“But then . . . ”
Harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed
creature trembled under the chair.
“What is that, Professor?”
“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumbledore.
“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again
“and nobody died for me this time—how can I be alive?”
“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember
what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”
Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If
this was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one,
with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and
still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair
708
King’s Cross
were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily,
without effort.
“He took my blood.” said Harry.
“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt
his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s
protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he
lives!”
“I live . . . while he lives! But I thought . . . I thought it was the
other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same
thing?”
He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again.
“Are you sure we can’t do anything?”
“There is no help possible.”
“Then explain . . . more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled.
“You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never
meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke
apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what
escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more
than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the
would-be victim who had survived.
“And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry!
That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and
innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing.
That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the
reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.
“He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He
709
Chapter 35
took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother
laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice
alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does
Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.”
Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.
“And you knew this? You knew— all along?”
“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long
time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and
tremble.
“There’s more,” said Harry. “There’s more to it. Why did my
wand break the wand he borrowed?”
“As to that, I cannot be sure.”
“Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed.
“What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever
have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort.
“Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form.
A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to
strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrifice into
himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible
power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, had dared to touch
your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he
could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at
all.
“Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your
destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined
710
King’s Cross
in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that
shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was twin of his, had never
expected.
“He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had
accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord
Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand
overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between
those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their
masters.
“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him
when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and
mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against
him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had
ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance
did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?”
“But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able
to break it?” asked Harry.
“My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of
magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am
sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.
Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It
was very hard to be sure of things like time, here.
711
Chapter 35
“He killed me with your wand.”
“He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected
Harry. “I think we can agree you are not dead— though, of course,”
he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize
your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.”
“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down
at his clean, unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”
“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking
around. “Where would you say that we are?”
Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give.
“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station. Except a
lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.”
“King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. “Good gracious, really?”
“Well, where do you think we are?” asked Harry, a little defensively.
“My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.”
Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being
infuriating. He glared at him, then remember a much more pressing
question than that of their current location.
“The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to see that
the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face.
“Ah, yes,” he said. He even looked a little worried.
“Well?”
For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked
less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small
boy caught in wrongdoing.
“Can you forgive me?” he said. “Can you forgive me for not
712
King’s Cross
trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you
would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my
mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time
now, that you are the better man.”
“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes.
“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desperate man’s dream!”
“But they’re real!”
“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore.
“And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets
from you anymore. You know.”
“What do I know?”
Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still
sparkled in his brilliantly blue eyes.
“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?”
“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course—how can you
ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!”
“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking
reassurance. “Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.”
“Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling,
and defend Dumbledore from himself. “Hallows, not Horcruxes.”
“Hallows,” mumbled Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes. Precisely”
There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but
Harry no longer looked around.
“Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked.
Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded.
713
Chapter 35
“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said
quietly. “Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He
wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed,
because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the
place the third brother had died.”
“So it’s true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers—
”
“—were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely
road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems
to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such
creations.
“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages,
father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last
living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of
Godric’s Hollow.”
Dumbledore smiled at Harry.
“Me?”
“You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my
possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it
to me just a few days previously. It explained so much of his
undetected wrong-doing at school! I could hardly believe what
I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long
since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not
resist, could not help taking a closer look . . . It was a Cloak the
likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every
respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at
714
King’s Cross
last, all to myself!”
His tone was unbearably bitter.
“The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,” Harry
said quickly. “Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The
Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.”
“True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.”
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted
him.
“So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the
Cloak?”
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced
himself to meet Harry’s eyes. “You know what happened. You
know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.”
“But I don’t despise you— ”
“Then you should,” said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath.
“You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles
did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my
mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana.
“I resented it, Harry.”
Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over
the top of Harry’s head, into the distance.
“I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to
shine. I wanted glory.
“Do not misunderstand me,” he said, and pain crossed the face
so that he looked ancient again. “I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry,
more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could
possibly imagine.
715
Chapter 35
“So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility
of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village
in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then,
of course, he came. . . .”
Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again.
“Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me,
Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards
triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the
revolution.
“Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty
words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done
would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know,
in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I
did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to
fruition, all my dreams would come true.
“And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How
they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The
Resurrection Stone— to him, though I pretended not to know it, it
meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of
my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders.
“And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak
much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be
used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought
that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but
our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for
the legend said that the man who united all three objects would
then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’
716
King’s Cross
“Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore!
Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only
two members of my family left to me.
“And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in
the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable
brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did
not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a
fragile and unstable sister in tow.
“The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That
which I had always sensed in him, though I had pretended not
to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my
mother’s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.”
Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest.
Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him:
He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained
control.
“Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted.
He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for
Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams
in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I
was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my
terrible grief, the price of my shame.
“Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had
procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the
post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally,
I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.”
“But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!” burst out Harry.
“Would I?” asked Dumbledore heavily. “I am not so sure. I
717
Chapter 35
had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness
and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those
who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.
Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take
up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise
that they wear it well.
“I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher— ”
“You were the best— ”
“—you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with
the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army.
They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than
I feared him.
“Oh, not death,” said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. “Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that
we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful.
It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in
that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my
sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right. Harry, I
dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who
brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and
stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her
life.
“I think he knew it. I think he knew what frightened me. I
delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful
to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable,
and I had to do what I could.
“Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won
the wand.”
Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had
718
King’s Cross
ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know,
and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last
he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the
Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding
of the fascination it had exercised over Harry.
They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the
creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore.
At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going
after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had
it.”
Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose.
“They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell
at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he
did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that
lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent
Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . . ”
“ . . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested
Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes.
After another short pause Harry said, “You tried to use the
Resurrection Stone.”
Dumbledore nodded.
“When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts— the Hallow I had craved most of all,
though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons— I
lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that
the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on,
and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and
my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry
719
Chapter 35
I was . . .
“I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned
nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deadly Hallows. I had proved
it time and again, and here was the final proof.”
“Why?” said Harry. “It was natural! You wanted to see them
again. What’s wrong with that?”
“Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was
fit only to possess the meanest one of them, the least extraordinary.
I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to
kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took
it, not for gain, but to save others from it.
“But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could
never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The
stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are
at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You
are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.”
Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the
old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How could he
remain angry with Dumbledore now?
“Why did you have to make it so difficult?”
Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous.
“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry.
I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart.
I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those
tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the
wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them,
I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of
death, because the true master does not seek to run away from
Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there
720
King’s Cross
are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.”
“And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?”
“I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection
Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about
them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any
except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak,
and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the
dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.
“But you expected him to go after the wand?”
“I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat
Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was
afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he
had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of
the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the
borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead
of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your
wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally
set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other.
For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his
obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his
last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus. . . .”
“If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end
up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?”
“I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did
not work as I had intended, did it?”
“No,” said Harry. “That bit didn’t work out.”
The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and
Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The
realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry
721
Chapter 35
in the long minutes, like softly falling snow.
“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?”
“That is up to you.”
“I’ve got a choice?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in King’s Cross,
you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be
able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.”
“And where would it take me?”
“On,” said Dumbledore simply.
Silence again.
“Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.”
“True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.”
“But you want me to go back?”
“I think,” said Dumbledore, “that if you choose to return, there
is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it.
But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning
here than he does.”
Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and
choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.
“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all,
those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that
fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems
to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.”
Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be
nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm
and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back
to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore
did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other’s
faces.
722
King’s Cross
“Tell me one last thing,” said Harry. “Is this real? Or has this
been happening inside my head?”
Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and
strong in Harry’s ears even though the bright white mist was descending again, obscuring his figure.
“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on
earth should that mean that it is not real?”
723
Chapter 36
The Flaw in the Plan
H
e was lying facedown on the ground again. The smell
of the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold
hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his
glasses, which had been knocked sideways by the fall,
cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place
where the Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an ironclad punch. He did not stir but remained exactly where he had
fallen, with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his
mouth gaping.
He had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at
his death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous
murmurs filled the air.
“My Lord . . . my Lord . . . ”
It was Bellatrix’s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry
did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore
his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath
his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the
ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told
724
The Flaw in the Plan
him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight.
“My Lord . . . ”
“That will do,” said Voldemort’s voice.
More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the
same spot. Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry
opened his eyes by a millimeter.
Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death
Eaters were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside
Voldemort.
Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen.
The Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who
seemed to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened
when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too
collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had fallen briefly
unconscious and both of them had now returned. . . .
“My Lord, let me— ”
“I do not require assistance,” said Voldemort coldly, and though
he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful
hand. “The boy . . . Is he dead?”
There was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached
Harry, but he felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press him
harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid
might twitch.
“You,” said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shriek
of pain. “Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.”
Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could
only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be
examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though it
725
Chapter 36
was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort
suspected that all had not gone to plan. . . .
Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry’s face,
pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest,
and felt his heart. He could hear the woman’s fast breathing, her
long hair tickled his face. He knew that she could feel the steady
pounding of life against his ribs.
“Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?”
The whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch from his
ear, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from
the onlookers.
“Yes,” he breathed back.
He felt the hand on his chest contract; her nails pierced him.
Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up.
“He is dead!” Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.
And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped
their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and
silver light shoot into the air in celebration.
Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa
knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts,
and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer
cared whether Voldemort won.
“You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult. “Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now!
Watch! Crucio!”
Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort’s victory. He was lifted
into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet
726
The Flaw in the Plan
the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice,
three times into the air: His glasses flew off and he felt his wand
slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing
echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter.
“Now,” said Voldemort, “we go to the castle, and show them
what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No—
Wait— ”
There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moment
Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him.
“You carry him,” Voldemort said, “He will be nice and visible
in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And
the glasses—put on the glasses—he must be recognizable— ”
Someone slammed Harry’s glasses onto his face with deliberate
force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were
exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid’s arms trembling with
the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him
as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by
movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet,
lost.
“Move,” said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing
his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest.
Branches caught at Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent,
his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while
the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed
blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed
neck of Harry Potter. . . .
The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry
could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made
727
Chapter 36
so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the
jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession
marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could
tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids,
that the trees were beginning to thin.
“BANE!”
Hagrid’s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry’s eyes open.
“Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn’ fight, yeh cowardly bunch o’
nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter’s—d–dead . . . ?”
Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry
wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass;
he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters
called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little
later, Harry sensed, by the freshening of the air, that they had
reached the edge of the forest.
“Stop.”
Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey
Voldemort’s command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill
settled over them where they stood, and Harry heard the rasping
breath of the dementors that patrolled the outer trees. They would
not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him,
a talisman against them, as though his father’s stag kept guardian
in his heart.
Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically
magnified so that it swelled through the grounds, crashing upon
Harry’s eardrums.
“Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to
save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you
728
The Flaw in the Plan
his body as proof that your hero is gone.
“The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My
Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished.
There must be no more war. Anybody who continues to resist,
man, woman, or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member
of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and
you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and
sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new
world we shall build together.”
There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort
was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again.
“Come,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead,
and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a
fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing the
great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted
cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters,
who marched on either side of them through the slowly lightening
darkness. . . .
“Harry,” sobbed Hagrid. “Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . . ”
Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the
gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps,
signs of life from those within.
“Stop.”
The Death Eaters came to a halt; Harry heard them spreading
out in a line facing the open front doors of the school. He could
see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light
streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any mo729
Chapter 36
ment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying
apparently dead, in Hagrid’s arms.
“NO!”
The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a
sound. He heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that
Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall’s despair. He squinted again for a
single second and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the
survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their
vanquishers and see the truth of Harry’s death for themselves. He
saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini’s
head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again.
“No!”
“No!”
“Harry! HARRY!”
Ron’s, Hermione’s, and Ginny’s voices were worse than McGonagall’s; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made
himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of
survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the
Death Eaters, until—
“SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash
of bright light, and silence was forced upon them all. “It’s over!
Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!”
Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass.
“You see?” said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay. “Harry
Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was
nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!”
730
The Flaw in the Plan
“He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a
second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.
“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,”
said Voldemort, and there was relish in his voice for the lie, “killed
while trying to save himself— ”
But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout,
then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened
his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the
crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the
ground, Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger’s wand aside
and laughing.
“And who is this?” he said in his soft snake’s hiss. “Who has
volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue
to fight when the battle is lost?”
Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh.
“It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been
giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?”
“Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down at
Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no-man’s-land between the survivors and
the Death Eaters. “But you are a pureblood, aren’t you, my brave
boy?” Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty
hands curled into fists.
“So what if I am?” said Neville loudly.
“You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock.
You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind,
Neville Longbottom.”
731
Chapter 36
“I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from
the crowd, whom Voldemort’s Silencing Charms seemed unable to
hold.
“Very well,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in
the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. “If that
is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On
your head,” he said quietly, “be it.”
Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his
wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle’s shattered windows,
something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half
light and landed in Voldemort’s hand. He shook the mildewed
object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the
Sorting Hat.
“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” said Voldemort. “There will be no more Houses. The emblem, shield, and
colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone. Won’t they, Neville Longbottom?”
He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then
forced the hat onto Neville’s head, so that it slipped down below
his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front
of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands,
holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay.
“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to
anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said Voldemort,
and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst
into flames.
Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the
spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act—
732
The Flaw in the Plan
And then many things happened at the same moment.
They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as
what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the outof-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries.
At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the
castle and yelled, “HAGGER!” His cry was answered by roars from
Voldemort’s giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making
the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and
arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke
ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak
from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet,
as Neville moved too.
In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind
Curse upon; the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths
something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle—
The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of
the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the
stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a
single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun
high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance
hall, and Voldemort’s mouth was open in a scream of fury that
nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to the ground
at his feet—
Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield
Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise
his wand. Then, over the screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid’s yell came loudest of
all
“HARRY!” Hagrid shouted. “HARRY—WHERE’S HARRY?”
733
Chapter 36
Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the
Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants’ stamping feet, and
nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come
from who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring
around the heads of Voldemort’s giants, thestrals and Buckbeak
the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and
pummeled them, and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and
Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle. Harry
was shouting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see,
and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and
their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.
Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffeted
into the entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw
him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into
the Great hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he
sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms,
and Voldemort’s would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah
Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined
the fight already flourishing inside it.
And now there were more, even more people storming up the
front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace
Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed
to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and
friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along
with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs
Ban, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter
of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was
blasted off its hinges.
The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall,
734
The Flaw in the Plan
screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their
head, the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was
Kreacher, his bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din: “Fight!
Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of the house-elves! Fight the
Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!”
They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of
Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere
Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in
the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed
by the oncoming horde.
But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past struggling prisoners, and into the Great Hall.
Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking
and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but
fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became
more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their
way inside.
Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee
Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw
Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone
wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron
and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth Stunning
Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and
Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting
to fight, screaming for their son.
Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove
and ducked around him, unable to finish him—
735
Chapter 36
Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort,
and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and
Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them,
and Harry’s attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close
to Ginny that she missed death by an inch—
He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort,
but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways.
“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!”
Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms.
Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of
her new challenger.
“OUT OF MY WAY!” shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three
girls, and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry
watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley’s wand slashed
and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange’s smile faltered and became
a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the
witches’ feet became hot and cracked; both women were fighting
to kill.
“No!” Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying
to come to her aid. “Get back! Get back! She is mine!”
Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights,
Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry
stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to
protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent.
“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?”
taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses
danced around her. “When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?”
“You—will—never— touch— our—children— again!”
736
The Flaw in the Plan
screamed Mrs. Weasley.
Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius
had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly
Harry knew what was going to happen before it did.
Molly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched arm and
hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.
Bellatrix’s gloating smile froze, her eyes began to bulge: For the
tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she
toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed
Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and
writhing through the air, as Voldemort’s fury at the fall of his
last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort
raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.
“Protego!” roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in
the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source
as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last.
The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of
“Harry!” “HE’S ALIVE!” were stifled at once. The crowd was
afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and
Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to
circle each other.
“I don’t want anyone else to try to help.” Harry said loudly,
and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. “It’s
got to be like this. It’s got to be me.”
Voldemort hissed.
“Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, his red eyes wide. “That
isn’t how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield
today, Potter?”
737
Chapter 36
“Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more Horcruxes.
It’s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and
one of us is about to leave for good. . . .”
“One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taunt
and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. “You
think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident,
and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?”
“Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked
Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for
Harry no face existed but Voldemort’s. “Accident, when I decided
to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn’t defend myself
tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?”
“Accidents!” screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike,
and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. “Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled
behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to
kill them for you!”
“You won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they
circled, and stared into each other’s eyes, green into red. “You
won’t be able to kill any of them ever again. Don’t you get it? I
was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people— ”
“But you did not!”
“— I meant to, and that’s what it did. I’ve done what my
mother did. They’re protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how
none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can’t torture
them. You can’t touch them. You don’t learn from your mistakes,
Riddle, do you?”
738
The Flaw in the Plan
“You dare — ”
“Yes, I dare,” said Harry. “I know things you don’t know, Tom
Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don’t. Want to
hear some, before you make another big mistake?”
Voldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Harry
knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized and at bay, held
back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a
final secret. . . .
“Is it love again?” said Voldemort, his snake’s face jeering.
“Dumbledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered
death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and
breaking like an old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me
stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach, Potter—
and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time
and take my curse. So what will stop you from dying now when I
strike?”
“Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled each other,
wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret.
“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said Voldemort,
“you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a
weapon more powerful than mine?”
“I believe both,” said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the
snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began
to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams;
humorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall.
“You think you know more magic than I do?” he said. “Than I,
than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore
himself never dreamed of?”
“Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than
739
Chapter 36
you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.”
“You mean he was weak!” screamed Voldemort. “Too weak
to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be
mine!”
“No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a
better man.”
“I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!”
“You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.”
For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds
of people around the walls drew breath as one.
“Dumbledore is dead!” Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as
though they would cause him unendurable pain. “His body decays
in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle. I have seen it,
Potter, and he will not return!”
“Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” said Harry calmly, “but you didn’t
have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months
before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought
was your servant.”
“What childish dream is this?” said Voldemort, but still he did
not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry’s.
“Severus Snape wasn’t yours,” said Harry. “Snape was Dumbledore’s. Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down
my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you
can’t understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you,
Riddle?”
Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other,
like wolves about to tear each other apart.
“Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” said Harry, “the same as my
mother’s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the
740
The Flaw in the Plan
time when they were children. You should have realized,” he said
as he saw Voldemort’s nostrils flare, “he asked you to spare her
life, didn’t he?”
“He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when
she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer
blood, worthier of him— ”
“Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumbledore’s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been
working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying
when Snape finished him!”
“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every
word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter.
“It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what
petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I
crushed your mother, Snape’s supposed great love! Oh, but it all
makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand!
“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He
intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But
I got there ahead of you, little boy— I reached the wand before
you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you
caught up, I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder
Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!”
“Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before you try to
kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done. . . . Think,
and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .”
“What is this?”
Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry
741
Chapter 36
saw his pupils contact to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes
whiten.
“It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve got left. . . . I’ve
seen what you’ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some
remorse. . . .”
“You dare—?” said Voldemort again.
“Yes, I dare,” said Harry, “because Dumbledore’s last plan
hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.”
Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry
gripped Draco’s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds
away.
“That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you
murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true
master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.”
“He killed— ”
“Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended
to die undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as
planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it
had never been won from him!”
“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!”
Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. “I stole the wand
from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against its last master’s
wishes! It’s power is mine!”
“You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t
enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t
you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard. . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed
742
The Flaw in the Plan
the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly
what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had
given him its allegiance. . . .
Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the
curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.
“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”
Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then
it was gone.
“But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are
right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer
have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have
killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy. . . .”
“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance.
I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand
from him.”
Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of
everyone in the Hall upon it.
“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry.
“Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed?
Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.”
A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above
them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest
window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that
Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high
voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing
Draco’s wand:
“Avada Kedavra!”
“Expelliarmus!”
The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that
743
Chapter 36
erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had
been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry
saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand
fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted
ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the
master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it
at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of a Seeker, caught the
wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed,
the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit
the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken,
the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing.
Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry
stood with two wands in his hands, staring down at his enemy’s
shell.
One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspend: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and
the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new
sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the
first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms
that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that
deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then
all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and
Flitwick and Spout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone
was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him,
trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all
of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was
over at last—
The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed
with life and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled
744
The Flaw in the Plan
outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration.
They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their
savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved
the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to on one.
He must speak to the bereaved, clap their hands, witness their
tears, receive their thanks, hear the new now creeping in from every
quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down
the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were
fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were
being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt
had been named temporary Minister of Magic. . . .
They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the
Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey,
and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House
anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts
and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering
in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and
people were through food into his laughing mouth. After a while,
exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench
beside Luna.
“I’d want some peace and quite, if it were me,” she said.
“I’d love some,” he replied.
“I’ll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.”
And before he could say a word she cried, “Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!” and pointed out of the window. Everyone who
heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and
got to his feet.
Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He
745
Chapter 36
spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on
her mother’s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours
and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the
sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded
by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables
he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as
though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but
nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked he
saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company
he craved most.
“It’s me,” he muttered, crouching down between them. “Will
you come with me?”
They stood up at once, and together he, Ron, and Hermione left
the Great Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade was gone, and rubble and bloodstains
occurred every few steps as they climbed.
Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming
through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition:
We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one,
And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun!
“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing,
doesn’t it?” said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through.
Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it
was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin
and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most
of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But
746
The Flaw in the Plan
first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck
with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he
recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened
in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their
shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to
which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned
their destination.
Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to
the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided,
looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would
be able to distinguish passwords anymore. “Can we go up?” he
asked the gargoyle.
“Feel free.” groaned the statue.
They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase
that moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open
the door at the top.
He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk
where he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry
out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth
of Voldemort—
But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and
head mistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation;
they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached
through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up
and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys
Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his
ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice,
“And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our
contribution not be forgotten!”
747
Chapter 36
But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest
portrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding
down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver
beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled
Harry with the same balm as phoenix song.
At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly
for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however,
and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed
though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece
of advice.
“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he began, “I dropped
it in the forest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to
go looking for it again. Do you agree?”
“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures
looked confused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but
no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know
where it fell?”
“No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.
“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and
Dumbledore beamed.
“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!”
“And then there’s this.”
Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked
at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived
state, Harry did not like to see.
“I don’t want it.” said Harry.
“What?” said Ron Loudly. “Are you mental?”
“I know it’s powerful,” said Ron wearily. “But I was happier
748
The Flaw in the Plan
with mine. So . . . ”
He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled
out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread
of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be
repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if
this did not work, nothing would.
He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touch it
with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said “Reparo.”
As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew
that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand
and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand
were rejoicing at their reunion.
“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” he told Dumbledore, who was
watching him with enormous affection and admiration, “back
where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death
like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it.”
Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.
“Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace of
longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand.
“I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly.
“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said Harry. “And
quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bead lying waiting for him in
Gryffindor Tower and wondering whether Kreacher might bring
him a sandwich there, “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.”

Epilogue
Nineteen Years Later
A
utumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning
of the first of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling
road towards the great sooty station, the fumes of car
exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the
cold air. Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the
parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and
the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching
her father’s arm.
“It won’t be long now, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told her.
“Two years,” sniffed Lily. “I want to go now!”
The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove
its way towards the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus’s voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his
sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.
“I won’t! I won’t be in Slytherin!”
“James, give it a rest!” said Ginny.
“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his younger
753
Epilogue
brother. “There’s nothing wrong with that. He might be in
Slyth— ”
But James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. The five
Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over
his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from
his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished.
“You’ll write to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother.
“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny.
“Not every day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most people
only get letters from home about once a month.”
“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny.
“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about
Hogwarts,” Harry put in. “He likes a laugh, your brother.”
Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering
speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and
three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam which
was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures
were swarming through the mist, into which James had already
disappeared.
“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy
forms they passed as they made their way down the platform
“We’ll find them,” said Ginny reassuringly.
But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody’s faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on
broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to
stop and say hello. . . .
754
Nineteen Years Later
“I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly.
A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when
Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up beside them.
“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.
Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes,
beamed at him.
“Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. Hermione
didn’t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She
thought I’d have to Confund the examiner.”
“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.”
“As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to
Harry, as together they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train.
“I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can
use a Supersensory Charm for that.”
Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger
brother, having an animated discussion about which House they
would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts.
“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ron,
“but no pressure.”
“Ron!”
Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.
“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was
no longer paying attention. Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded
covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned
for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the
shifting mist.
“Look who it is.”
Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark
755
Epilogue
coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat,
which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco
as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry,
Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and
turned away again.
“So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. “Make
sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited
your mother’s brains.”
“Ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione, half stern, half
amused. “Don’t try to turn them against each other before they’ve
even started school!”
“You’re right, sorry,” said Ron, but unable to help himself, he
added, “Don’t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad
Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.”
“Hey!”
James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk,
owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.
“Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over
his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. “Just seen him!
And guess what he’s doing? Snogging Victoire!”
He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack
of reaction.
“Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin!
And I asked Teddy what he was doing— ”
“You interrupted them?” said Ginny. “You are so like Ron— ”
“— and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me
to go away! He’s snogging her!” James added as though worried
he had not made himself clear.
“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married,” whispered Lily
756
Nineteen Years Later
sarcastically. “Teddy would really be part of the family then!”
“He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,”
said Harry. “Why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have
done with it?”
“Yeah!” said James enthusiastically. “I don’t mind sharing a
room with Al—Teddy could have my room!”
“No,” said Harry firmly, “you and Al will share a room only
when I want the house demolished.”
He checked the battered old watch which had once been Fabian
Prewett’s.
“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.”
“Don’t forget to give Neville our love!” Ginny told James as
she hugged him.
“Mum! I can’t give a professor love!”
“But you know Neville!— ”
James rolled his eyes.
“Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor Longbottom, isn’t
he? I can’t walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .”
Shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus.
“See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.”
“I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!”
But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him,
gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling
train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to
find his friends.
“Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry told Albus.
“They’re gentle things, there’s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages, you’ll be
757
Epilogue
going in the boats.”
Ginny kissed Albus good-by.
“See you at Christmas.”
“By, Al,” said Harry as his son hugged him. “Don’t forget
Hagrid’s invited you to tea next Friday. Don’t mess with Peeves.
Don’t duel anyone till you’ve learned how. And don’t let James
wind you up.”
“What if I’m in Slytherin?”
The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only
the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how
great and sincere that fear was.
Harry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his
own. Alone of Harry’s three children, Albus had inherited Lily’s
eyes.
“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny
could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving
to Rose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two
headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he
was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”
“But just say — ”
“— then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student,
won’t it? It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you,
you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting
Hat takes your choice into account.”
“Really?”
“It did for me,” said Harry.
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw
the wonder in Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors
were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred out758
Nineteen Years Later
lines of parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute
reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the
door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest
them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed
to be turned towards Harry.
“Why are they staring?” demanded Albus as he and Rose
craned around to look at the other students.
“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m extremely
famous.”
Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move,
and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving,
even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide
away from him. . . .
The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train
rounded a corner. Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell.
“He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny.
As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly
and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.
“I know he will.”
The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.
